0, on 09/11/18 13:53 PM (PDT),Gorj ,2017 Nissan Altima  2.5 SL 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),One Year Update," Purchased this Altima about a year ago.  In the past I have owned more up-class vehicles, but I thought I would give this one a try because I live to far from dealers who sell up-class vehicles. The local Nissan dealer offered a lifetime warranty on the drive train and that was my primary reason for the purchase. The Altima was loaded with everything offered for the model but lacked things like memory seats, rain sensing wipers, and lane departure warning. I have discovered the navigation is not up to date and no update is available. I would say this is a little above an average vehicle. Acceleration is acceptable, but noisy as four cylinders tend to be, but fuel economy is in the high 30's, and even going into the low 40's on long trips. The transmission is smooth - one hardly knows it is there. Road noise is about average for a vehicle in this price range. Handling is also about average - not great, but not bad either. Front seating is comfortable with plenty of adjustments for the driver, but not so many for the passenger. Rear seating is about average. There is a huge trunk, but the seat back releases are flawed because they have no way of moving away from the latch when pulling the release. I have put about 13k miles on this Altima with no mechanical issues. That is better than some up-class vehicles I have owned! I believe Nissan builds a quality vehicle that falls short of being really a really great vehicle. Finally, the deal I received from the Nissan dealer was not good and I should have shopped around some more. I suggest you do that before purchasing any vehicle.",4

June 2018 with approximately 12000 on it I had to get a new transmission. ABSOLUTELY REDICULOUS. I AM NOT HAPPY AT ALL. Nissan need to do something out of good faith since my car is not  consider a lemon.,3
2, on 07/01/18 07:55 AM (PDT),Bonddb9 ,2017 Nissan Altima  2.5 S 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),"CVT transmission replace 43,0000"," If buying  this car because there cheap make you sure you have factory  warranty or buy extended warranty to cover cvt transmission. Transmission  is  not the best . Mine went at 43,000 miles after I got the pc upgrade",4
3, on 05/09/18 18:57 PM (PDT),Ron ,2017 Nissan Altima  2.5 SL 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Could Be Better," Nissan offers a decent vehicle in this price range. The dealer I purchased this Altima was not up front with me about the pricing and soured my my experience from the get go. The only reason I purchased this particular dealer was that they offered a lifetime power train warranty, which I hear may be needed for the CVT. I hope not.  After comparing the offerings of the other vehicles in this class, I decided on the Altima. Considering this class of vehicle I believed the Altima offered the most of what I was looking for. That said, after owning the Altima for seven months I realize that it falls slightly short of what it could have been. It drives and handles well, although the engine has more noise upon acceleration than I would like. The seating is comfortable but this model failed to include seat memory. Guess they just forgot to offer it. Although it has blind spot warning, it does not have lane departure - guess they forgot that too!  Another feature they left out was key recognition when opening doors. You have to push a little button to open doors, or use the remote. I do like the keyless ignition and the remote start though. As far as safety, the adaptive cruise is fantastic. I also like the home link (garage door remote) in the rear view mirror, but Nissan left out back lighting for the buttons which you can not see in the dark! Speaking of the rear view mirror, I miss the compass in the mirror, another thing they left out!  I am averaging about 35 MPG which is about average for this Altima. I was hoping to get better. The trunk has ample room and I like the seat back latches easy access but again Nissan fell a little short, for when pulling the seat back release, the seat backs do not move away from the latch. You have to push on them with something from the rear or have someone pull the seat back forward while you pull the latch.  After some study I found the entertainment and navigation systems worked very well. I usually use a flash drive in the USB socket for my music, but the radio receiver works very well, as does the CD player.  The Bluetooth functions as both a phone extension and a music streamer for your Bluetooth devices. Since so many devices use a USB for charging it would have been nice to have another USB port.  Overall the 2017 Altima SL is a good ride disappointing that Nissan did not quite get it right in several areas.",4

I think I saw something on the internet. The dealership called me.  They talked me into coming down to the dealership.  My husband and I went down and we ended up buying the car on the spot.  I LOVE THIS CAR!  We both feel like we are almost in a sports car.  It is fun to drive, I feel very safe in it because of all of the safety features.  We both have loved this car  right from the first time we got into it.  We got all of the bells and whistle and we are still learning how to use it.  This is a great car for us. (NOTE: we have had nothing but SUV's for years, we moved our of an area that gets a lot of snow to the desert so I don't need an SUV, besides my husband still has one.)

9, on 02/25/18 12:49 PM (PST),Jeremiah Horton  ,2017 Nissan Altima  2.5 SV 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Great car for millennials.," This car is amusing on the outside. It gives off a mean, sleek, sporty look to it and it serves well in performance. I currently have the mid trim model (SV) and it has about everything you would possibly want Except the touch screen, YET, it does have the backup camera installed. This car is packed with safety features including forward collision emergency braking, blind spot assist, and it packs a mean punch in Sports Mode( DS on gear shift) but sacrifices from an average of 35mpg to maybe 24mpg. There is lots of back seat room, large trunk space and lots of front room into the Altima sedan. As for interior, it’s pretty boring, a bit outdated, but it doesn’t take away from the experience. So far my car is amazing, with awesome safety features and overall great car!",5

Is it as good as a Lexus, Infinity or Mercedes? Probably not. Is it $40K to $60K less good? Definitely not. You get a very quiet, spacious comfortable car with plenty of pickup and all the features for $25K instead of $65K to $85K. Check it out.",5
11, on 01/07/18 16:00 PM (PST),M. Ryan ,2017 Nissan Altima  2.5 S 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),"Comfortable car, but terrible transmission!!"," I received this car brand new (as a new company vehicle), and have now driven it for 7 months and 7k miles.  I'm trying to be as objective as possible here, but I would HIGHLY encourage anyone considering this vehicle to 1) lease it only, or 2) if you purchase it, sell it before the warranty expires because I can guarantee that you will be replacing the transmission between 60,000 and 100k miles (this is a factual statement based on my years of experience working in the auto industry, and frequent experience in dealing with people who own late model Nissan vehicles with failed CVT transmissions - which is what this car has).  If you don't believe me about the CVT transmission issues, please Google ""Nissan CVT transmission problems"" before buying this car.  There are thousands of complaints at ConsumerAffairs.com regarding Nissan CVT transmissions, and Nissan settled a class-action lawsuit that covered all 2007 to 2010 models (but the problem continues since no significant changes were made to their CVT transmissions following the law suit).  Also, if you buy this car please make sure to budget about $4000 to cover the cost of transmission replacement every 60k to 100K miles.  The problem is so bad that the 2017 Nissan owners manual no longer even recommends a transmission oil change.  The CVT transmission in this car primarily consists of two variable pulleys connected by a metal belt that constantly grinds against the sides of the pulleys to creates friction (and thereby drive the car forward).  As you can imagine, this is a poor and unreliable method of designing a transmission, but it saves money, weight, and results in slightly better fuel economy than a regular transmission.  As you drive, the transmission feels like it's constantly slipping (which it is).  The only time this car feels ""normal"" is on a flat, open highway at a constant speed with no wind and a light load.  At all other times, the transmission feels like it will survive another 5 miles it it before complete failure.  And that leads me to my next point.  This transmission usually fails without warning, often leaving owners in dangerous situations (imagine it failing on a busy Interstate Highway while you're driving to work, or have your kids in the car).  Never, in a hundred years, would I recommend this car to ANYONE - and anyone with half a brain (or at least some basic automotive knowledge) would not purchase this car due to the well documented history of Nissan CVT transmission problems.   There are some positives to this car (however), including very comfortable front seats, a very good driving position, very good gas mileage (30-31 mpg in mixed driving, and about 38 on the open highway), a well tuned suspension, very good brakes, and a well designed instrument panel and ergonomics.  Unfortunately I cannot (to anyone) recommend this vehicle due to the CVT transmission issue.  Hopefully Nissan listens to its customers and develops a proper 6 to 8 speed automatic transmission (like Toyota, GM, or Ford).  If they did, I would consider this to be a good overall vehicle and a good value.",2

The acceleration is great, almost like driving my prior Maximas (4), but better gas mileage, and the seats are more comfortable.  I got about 1/3 off ($10,000) the list price which convinced me to buy it rather than a comparable, new Maxima.  I think its styling is better than comparable Camry or Accord.

23, on 06/21/17 03:52 AM (PDT),CDR ,2017 Nissan Altima  2.5 S 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Altima continues its legacy of excellence," VST transmission takes some ""getting used to"" if you're accustomed to traditional automatics.  It doesn't ""shift"" when you think it should, but actually its doing it seamlessly.  Other than that (which isn't truly a detractor) this Altima is still the best dollar-for-dollar value in a mid-size sedan.  Built in the USA, the craftsmanship, quality, reliability and economy of this almost 40MPG sedan is excellent.  Got mine for just $17,600 - yes, to get this you still have to know how to negotiate sales with actual team members at the dealership, but it can be done.",5

End 06/17 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Best value of any car I've ever bought," For the money, this is the best equipped and most fun-to-drive car I've ever owned.  Might be partially attributed to my recent experience (driving a Prius for a couple of years), but this car feels luxurious, quiet and powerful, especially considering the price point.  The SR is very stylish and sporty looking - spoiler, dual exhaust, upscale alloy wheels, dark tinted glass, manual shifters on the steering column (but automatic transmission primary) - but fuel economy is as good as an econobox.  The ride is truly outstanding, barely a notch below the Lexus ES350 I owned a few years ago at not much more than half the price!  I have owned 3 Maximas in my life and this car is every bit as much fun to drive as any of them.  I am admittedly a bit partial to Nissan since I live in the Nashville, TN area where their US headquarters is located, but would never settle for second-best just out of loyalty.  Would recommend anyone considering an economical, comfortable and fun mid-sized sedan to try out this car!!!",5

Ask for Sales Rep Scott Ryan if you dont use the Internet route to get pricing.  Great deal, great guy, no pressure, easy to do business with all from Finance Manager, Sales Manaager, and Customer Care Manager, all easy going, friendly supportive folks.

They offer free lifetime car washes and oil changes and have had the car washed 3 times already so its real folks.  The Altima is a dream to drive and own---we owned one for 17 years before we bought this one, so we already know quality and longevity is on our side with this Make and Model.

I would have liked to get the 3.5, but this is a commuter for my wife, 52 miles a day. Our 2008 Durango was killing us at 12 MPG, but this is great at 26 to 30 MPG, essentially cutting our gas bill in half or better. Plus I get the Durango back, which has 10 months an 6,500 miles left on it's warranty. I only do about 250 - 300 miles with it a month, so we're running 2 cars with a gas bill smaller than before. We have 30,500 miles and 24 months left on the Altima's Bumper to Bumper Warranty and 72 months and 94,500 miles left on the powertrain warranty, so I'm comfortable with ""Reliability"".

I've dabbled in older models with no real issues. However this has been a pretty unpleasant experience. On the surface the SR model is nice, what it lacks in the driver assists and tech it makes up for in fairly striking appearance with the SR package. Blue accented interior, paddle shifters, 18in wheels. Its a nice looking car. However the 2.5 and more importantly the CVT trans are slugs. And worse than that, within 10k miles the MAF sensor went out. And as i write this review at 28k the transmission has failed completely. Please be mindful about buying these new Nissans, we have a 2015 Mazda 3 and that is a solid well made car. Probably getting a CX5 next!",2

I also needed something that my ageing mother could get in and out of with ease. I bought my 2016 2.5 S a year and a half ago, and it currently has 14,800 miles on it. I had custom wheels put on it to set it apart from all the other 2.5 S's out there.  The gas mileage is unbelievable. I'm averaging 30 mpg in town and have gotten 41 mpg on the highway. This car is comfortable. I was concerned about comfort because I a big guy, 6'2"" 300 lbs. I've never felt cramped in this car. It's pretty zippy and handles well. It does sit pretty low. The air-conditioning and heat are great. The stereo is ok. The Bluetooth and voice commands seem to be a miss. It takes a bit for my phone to connect and hands free calling rarely works for me, no matter how clearly I say someone's name. I'd like a place to stash my phone, other than the cup holders. Over all I'm very satisfied with my little red Altima",5

I took it to the dealer, for maintenance, and when they gave it back to me it didn't have any of the acceleration anymore.  I've been trying to work with Nissan and their dealers to get it back to my ""original"" experience.  Most dealer techs acknowledge that it doesn't perform the way a 3.5 SR should be performing; acceleration, handling, etc., but will only tell me that it's operating within specs.  The problem is, it seems that the dealers have (at most) only received one of these models so they're not familiar with the difference of having a 6 cylinder versus a 4 cylinder under the hood.  I don't know what to do, but would warn anyone thinking of purchasing the 3.5 SR....don't.  You may think you're buying that ""pocket rocket"", but after the dealer hooks it up to their diagnostics, you'll be driving the 2.5 version.",2

Unfortunately the road/tire noise resonated on the inside of the car, and this was especially evident on rough road surfaces, patched areas, and seams. It's very unfortunate since the seat comfort and interior features are top notch. I would recommend that owners of this car pull up all carpeting, and install sound deadener material everywhere possible! While I'm on a rant, the car is too long, and will not fit in my garage. The only positive for me was the great gas mileage.",3

The technology features are outstanding and very user friendly. I honestly love everything about this car. I've had it for about a month, and no complaints to report. Accelerates well off of stops, doesn't feel cramped with passengers, and has ample trunk space. I had a great experience with the Nissan dealer that I worked with to purchase the car, and will be taking it back to them for routine maintenance like oil changes and such. This car gets better gas mileage than my old hybrid! This has been a fantastic car so far for commuting, but would be very comfortable for longer trips as well. Would definitely recommend the Nissan Altima.",5

Since 1969, this is my eighth Nissan in a row (two Sentras and six Altimas). My main reason for staying with Nissan cars is their reliability. Over the years, I have several owned vehicles from each of the big three manufacturers and seven cars built  by Japan's largest manufacturer. In have found my eight Nissans to be the most reliable, trouble free cars that I have owned.  My 1997 Altima had gone more than 130,000 miles without any problems, when I traded it for a new 2001 Altima. In 2010, we gave it to our son, who drove it for four years, without any problems, except normal maintenance. When he traded it, the car had more than 150,000 miles on the dometer. I am now 76 years old and retired on Social Security. My wife and I were looking for a new vehicle that would last us through our retirement years, so when we found this new 2016 leftover at Morlan Nissan, the dealership made us an offer we could not resist.",5

I will start with the good parts of the car.  The CVT transmission is smooth and the engine power is adequate.  The trunk size is a decent and seats were ok for long drives.  The fuel mileage was excellent.  Now for the negatives.  The interior of the car is just cheap.  There are lots of hard plastics everywhere.  The nobs feel cheap, and I don't see it holding up.  The driving dynamics of the car was horrible.  I felt that I had to always make corrections going down a straight highway.  The transitions badly needs to be reprogrammed as it always feel like it is in too high of a gear at lower speeds which makes the engine on the verge of stall.  I am sure this was done to drive better fuel economy.  I just don't know why someone would buy this car or a similarly price Honda Accord which is like a luxury car compared to the Altima.",2

It is the perfect size, even the back seat is adequate, certainly for shorter rides.  It has a much smoother ride than I expected, particularly since I came from a Lincoln Town car.  Great mileage, and a nice big gas tank mean a great range before having to stop.  Only real criticism as to do with the cheap plastic in the interior that I know will degrade, wear or crack with time and use, specifically the door storage slots.  These were not made to be durable.Update:  I continue to love this car.  It is the perfect size for me as I lug around things for some travel.  I also have not received much in the way of complaints about the back seat.  It's reasonably comfortable - although I'd prefer a bit more lumbar support.

It replaced a 2013 Ford Fiesta SE that had all sorts of transmission problems. I have also owned a dodge, a Chevy and a Toyota. I had wanted to purchase an Altima before I bought the Fiesta, but at the time couldn't afford one. When I went to buy the Altima I had done my research, read reviews and knew exactly what I wanted. I got a smoking deal on this car and could not be happier. So many great things about this car - the seats are SO comfortable, the exterior of the car is beautiful, and I have no complaints about the performance. I've got a little over 2,500 miles on it, currently getting 31 mpg. I do mostly highway driving so I'm hoping the mpg will increase to the 34-39 range that it is rated for. When researching the car I read multiple complaints about the cabin noise at highway speeds. I drive 80 down the highway at least 5 times a week and I can say I don't know what they're talking about. It's not any louder than any other car I've ever driven. Well done with this car Nissan.",5

Typically exceed the 39 MPG for highway driving all on regular unleaded. This car moves. No issues whatsoever when merging onto highway or passing. The CVT always makes sure there is plenty of torque either from a dead stop or highway speeds. The new styling makes it look like a mini Maxima. Love this vehicle. One of the better navigation systems I have owned. Simple to use and usually right on the mark. Bose sound system is amazing and pounds when you turn up the dial without distortion.

This is the nicest car I've ever owned. I think the SV model could be the best value in an Altima since you get some wonderful safety features (including rear-cross traffic alert and blind spot alerts) along with some nice upgrade options like dual-zone climate control and the power driver's seat with lumbar. Mine also has the navigation package and the sunroof. While I do hear some road and engine noise in this car, I feel it's quiet enough inside because I can have conversations at normal levels. The front seats are amazingly comfortable. As for acceleration, it's a bit slow off the line, but there's plenty of power in the 4-cylinder model for my needs. It feels solidly planted on the road and I feel safe in it. All in all, it looks sharp inside and out -- it has a great Cayenne Red paint job -- and I've enjoyed my time with it. Plus, the gas mileage is terrific. In the past, I've gone about 6-7 days on a tank of gas, but I can go up to 10 days on a tank of gas with this car.",5
61, on 09/20/16 16:05 PM (PDT),Kumacho ,2016 Nissan Altima  2.5 SL 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),The 2016 changes make this car.," I am a dyed in the wool gearhead.  I love cars, I have always loved cars.  However, as age caught up to me I felt it was time to leave my Detroit muscle and sports cars behind.  When I first decided to buy a more (as my wife puts it) “Adult” car I looked at the 2013 Altima.  I liked the features but I let the dealership steer me to a Dodge Avenger because that was the only car they had that would be suitable for getting me out of the Audi A6 I was upside down in.  They made it clear they could work the deal on the Dodge but not the Nissan.What a fool I was.  I should have stuck to my guns and not have gotten the Dodge.  When I decided on the Nissan I drove the Kia Optima, Hyundai Sonata, Chevrolet Malibu and the Toyota Camry.While I liked the Optima most of all (2.0 liter turbo) it was more expensive than the others and the dealer wouldn’t deal with us.  The Altima and the Sonata hybrid were actually tied as far as driving and initial quality.  But the Sonata hybrids in the area were all base vehicles and the limited were hard to find.The Malibu and the Toyota were both in last place as a tie.  The Malibu just didn’t have the fit finish and feel of the others.  Cheaper plastics and the infotainment system was not to my liking.  The Camry fell so low because it lacked styling and didn’t seem as advanced as the others.  The Intelligent Cruise Control (ICC) on the Altima works really well.  I was actually very surprised at what it could do.  To test it; I allowed it to slow me all the way to a stop.  When it came to a stop the car sat there for about two seconds and a chime warned me the ICC was turning off.The front seats are nearly lazy boy recliner comfortable.  Nissan’s Zero Gravity seats are not just a gimmick they really are very comfortable.  I find them just as comfortable as the 2005 Audi A6 I had two cars ago.Here is where most people have a problem with the Altima.  They are not accustomed to the Constant Variable Transmission (CVT) and the way it feels.  For a four cylinder car that gets as high as 42mpg on the freeway (I got that on a 180 mile trip) And 0-60 in 8.2 seconds is not that bad for a midsized 2.5l car!  It just doesn’t feel like a normal transmission.  Even in Ds (Sport mode) the transmission doesn’t give shift points really.  It tries to simulate them, but it does fail.  What the CVT doesn’t fail at is giving smooth power at a constant rate and delivers great MPG.I was a little concerned about the reliability issues with the transmission.  Until I read the article about Nissan demanding Jatco (the manufacturer of the CVT) make them right.  Everything I have read shows the early problems were just that, early problems…  I also own a Subaru Outback with a CVT and it feels different.  Much more “slushy” feeling.",5
62, on 09/18/16 14:53 PM (PDT),Deric ,2016 Nissan Altima  3.5 SR 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Glad I rented before buying one.," This may be a ok car for short daily drives. For a start, it is lacking off the line. Huge hesitation. Not expecting to smoke tires but more than a kind of ""Ok I'm going."" But we did get good fuel mileage at about 35mpg. Back to the major negative, This is not a car for long trips. Took it for a 12hr vacation trip and was miserable. The drive train and road noise is terrible. At average of 70mph there is way too much noise. The radio as to be turned up so loud to enjoy it that when slowing down to pay tolls you felt like your blasted out of the car. This is with the speed volume controls turned on. Not only that but the car jumps and jitters at every bump. So much so that you can hear every loose piece in the interior rattle. The the seats are not comfortable as my back was sore after one way. My passengers in the back were not anymore comfortable. Only thing good was at least there was good interior space. The headrest is absolutely useless. It's hardness  and angle are not useful. I was half tempted to pull the thing off. I was worried if I was in an accident that I would suffer from a neck injury just from my head hitting the headrest. Now I all fairness, I know I wasn't driving the top of the line version of the car. So I can't expect all the luxury in the world. But a base model should create excitement to want to upgrade to get more from the car. What this base felt like is punishment for going base. I don't want to feel like I have to spend the extra to have a decent car. I want to start with a decent car and then want to upgrade to make it better. This is not a car I would buy just to see if it is worth the extra money.",2
63, on 09/13/16 10:08 AM (PDT),Nick A ,2016 Nissan Altima  2.5 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Great car so far," Love the styling of the altima for 2016. It has great acceleration even with the four cylinder and handles pretty good. Ive been averaging 31mpg with mostly city driving. Road noise is a little much but i think its these cheap tires it comes w from the factory. Engine makes alot of noise but i like to hear my engine most of the time. The A/C in this car will freeze you to a solid block of ice in no time even on low. Only have 1200 miles so far but will update my review as time goes on.

The price is too high for the features -- or lack of.  I am currently on a road trip visiting family in another state and found out there are NO REAR SPEAKERS in my car!  I couldn't understand why they weren't playing and when I arrived, my brother and I looked in the trunk and he said there's no wiring and we could see air space where the speakers are supposed to be. I don't know if there's supposed to be rear speakers or not (what car wouldn't??) but will definitely find out when I return home after the holiday!  I have been disappointed from the start and horribly regret signing the contract!  Note:  I love Altimas. I just do not like the base model not the price they charge for it. Please look and consider all models til your feet fall off before you sign any papers!UPDATE:  I've had the Altima for 1 1/2 yrs now.  Hwy mileage is great! Driving in town I only get about 16 miles per gal. It says its getting more and it tracks how many miles are left before empty, but by the time I drive six miles it uses twice the amount of gas than it says it has left.  And I understand starting & stopping plays a major factor in it.  I wish I had just put money towards my Honda Accord. Very regretful.",1
67, on 08/26/16 09:44 AM (PDT),mccd04 ,2016 Nissan Altima  2.5 SL 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Beware something is up with the Nissan Altima," I parked my new Nissan in my daughter's driveway and took a couple of items into her house, I cam back out to get the rest and my car was gone.  I look around and see it sitting in the neighbors yard across the street in their bushes.  I walk across the street open the car and push the button to start it and move it back in the driveway and this time I set the parking brake.  I immediately call the dealership and get told to bring it in for them to look at.  After the dealership having my car for a month which is longer than I had it before this happening they tell me they can't find anything wrong and for me just to always set my parking brake but when it happens again to not move the vehicle just call them immediately and they will come get the car.  They also told me that most likely the car wasn't all the way in PARK thus it rolled across the street and hit the neighbors bushes and because when a Nissan  Altima hits something the transmission automatically puts the car in Neutral that is why I was able to start it without it being in PARK.  Initial questions from the dealership were 1. When I got back in the car did I have to shift gears before starting it.  NO 2 Did I recall hearing anything when I opened the car door.  NO  .   Problem I have with this logic after getting my car back I ran a series of tests.  1. No matter what gear I have the car in other than park it keeps beeping and flashes a message to put car in park.  2. I have reached out to several friends who are mechanics to find out if it's the truth that when in a collision that in the Nissan Altima the transmission really gets put into Neutral(of course I don't want to intentionally hit something to see if it  is true or not).   To be noted also I have numerous friends and family and this is my third Nissan Altima and this is the first safety issue I have had but to me it is a big one.  I will say one of my 2014 Nissan Altima's did have an issue with the entire console constantly going out sometimes for a few minutes sometimes for a day after 18 months and over 12 visits at the shop they replaced it but after a little bit it started doing it all over again which is why I traded it in June for the 2016 because I was tired of constantly having to spend half a day at the car dealership why they tried to repair my car.",2
68, on 08/16/16 07:22 AM (PDT),Mikey 2 ,2016 Nissan Altima  2.5 SL 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Great update from 2014 SV to 2016 SL," The lease on my 2014 SV was about to end, I had about 6.5K over the allotment and was not sure if they were going to charge me all of them if I purchased another Nissan. I test drove several cars 3.5 Altima SL and 2.5 as well as Maxima SV. After the test drive I made my mind up on a 2.5 SL with Moonroof and LED Tech package. Nissan addressed  all the shortcomings of the previous model...IE: transmission, road noise, interior plastic. Don't get me wrong the 2014 SV was a good car but the 2016 SL is  so much better. The dealer worked with me, gave me a great price didn't have to pay for the extra miles either on the purchase. The SL come standard with Michelin tires which are relatively quiet so I'm not sure about other reviews that complain about road noise, mine is pretty quiet. Update after 10k miles, fuel economy is still great, road and wind noise did increase but still better than my 2014. The 2016 has acoustic glass wich makes it quieter by default. Still enjoy driving the car but I understand what people are saying about road noise. Update after 16k miles, still going strong seats are more confortable and MPG is a solid 33 mpg with more highway than city driving. Love the remote start and heated seat, steering wheel and outside mirror in colder months. No issues just regular maintenance. I now have 24k miles on my Nissan and had a couple of issues the first is with the dealer since they changed the cabin air cleaner I heard wind noises coming from the fan blower motor as it turns out the tech didn’t replace the air cleaner door properly causing this loud noise when the fan was on higher speeds. The other was that I was hearing what sounded like a winter tire hum every time I slowed down ( in the south we don’t need winter tires) the noise turn out to be a bad rear hub at 22k miles!! Hopefully this was an anomaly. I’ll keep everyone posted if anything goes wrong.",5

I now have 11240 miles and nothing much has changed. Car is still very comfortable as a daily driver. Ride comfort and handling are very good. Road noise on the highway isn't great, but acceptable. Great fuel economy. I may consider the 3.5 next time around for the extra power and less road noise, but the 2.5 isn't bad in town or on the hwy. Still love the look of the car with the SR package. The interior is holding up great, though I will say that I clean the vehicle on a weekly basis so it still looks like new. Other than a couple of recalls and oil changes, the vehicle has been pretty much maintenance free.",5
75, on 07/15/16 12:22 PM (PDT),michael yarber ,2016 Nissan Altima  2.5 SV 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),"Goodbye Accord, Hello Altima"," I had a 2014 Accord, our third one and we love Hondas, but after a long trip from Nashville to Richmond, VA, I couldn't stand it.  The drivers' seat was wearing me out!  I couldn't sit for more than 90 miles at a time.  I told my wife, we have to look for another car.  I was going to buy another Honda, but the new ones weren't any better in the seat department.  I saw an ad for a Altima(NASA seats) and we went to try one out.  We live just five miles from the Nissan plant and never thought about buying one since we see them everywhere.  I sat in it and thought...Wow this is nice and went for the test drive.  I liked almost everything about it.  After the negotiating stage, we bought it.  The ride was great and and seats were even better!  Yes, we did make another long drive again and with no problems, I loved the ride. We bought the SV model and my only regret  is that we should have got the NAV option.  Nissan has done a good job on the new '16 model.  One that long trip from Nashville to Indy, we got over 40mpg.  At one point I saw 41.3.  We are getting a good 30mpg in the city.  Thanks Nissan for making a better than excepted car.10,000 UPDATE:We have had the car about 10 months now and still really like it.  We average about 30mpg in the city, it rides really good.  The only thing I am not (a little) liking is the CVT.  It wants to ""search"" to get up to speed. It is not as instant as other cars I own like my Mazda.   I go to church with a Nissan executive and he said the '18 model will have a new engine.  I am not a big fan of a CVT but on the highway it gives you great milage.  I learned to press the Sport mode on the gear shift to get a little more response when I  need it.My stars are still the same, maybe the '18 model engine will be an improvement.",4

Stay away from Nissan Altima or buy extended warranty over extended warranty. I wish I was not influenced in my decision making. I paid $23,000 for this junk car.

I've only had my 2016 for a month but so far it is the best by far. My only complaint is the USB port won't work with my iPhone. Nissan says it will be corrected and is due to an upgrade to the IOS by Apple. Not sure why that would happen if they had good programmers but as long as it is corrected soon it's not a big issue to me.,5

Having owned 2 Altimas (and my parents have owned 3) I can say that they are great cars and we've never truly had any issues. In fact, my mother swears by them as she has been rear-ended 2 times in her vehicles and walked away with no issues.  I have owned Toyotas and can never get truly comfortable in their cars--but Nissan/Infiniti, I can always find a comfortable driving position.  My wife owned an Accord, and after purchasing her Nissan Rogue and riding in my Altima, she will never go back to Honda again.  I am truly impressed by the midyear refreshes on this 2016b Altima SL. I am glad they finally upgraded the headlights, and the navigation is MUCH better than my last model. The voice interactive software actually works better with the iPhone as well and you can access Siri through the voice controls. Even the SiriusXM interface is upgraded. AND...finally the Altima has phone control remote...the NISSAN CONNECT is ACTUALLY USEFUL this time around.",5
80, on 05/13/16 13:38 PM (PDT),Mr. Pierott ,2016 Nissan Altima  2.5 S 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Air bag defect within 1st 500 miles," Great car if they would 1st take responsibility for the defective passenger airbag. Car is perfect but airbag system is still defective. Even with 6 videos and a service advisor seeing the defect unless the computer reads it Nissan will do nothing feel free to verify before you purchase the vehicle. Also even after the recall and no solution from Nissan they are still selling the defective vehicle knowing that future customers safety is in jeopardy. Consumer affairs is a big joke and a waste of time. Again I will say the car runs excellent and is great for its value but with a key component like the airbag being defective and Nissan unwilling to fix the problem even if you have actual proof it is almost pointless to buy this vehicle. You have been warned passenger side airbag on the 2016  Altima will show airbag off light even when the seat is occupied by a passenger of correct weight and sitting in the seat in the proper position with the seatbelt on. Even if you video record the defect in action as well even if one of their own service advisors or mechanics see the defect in action they will not repair your vehicle if the computer does not detect the defect. Do not expect any support from Nissan North America in resolving the problem they will not replace any parts and they will try to convince you this is there new intelligent technology and this is how it should be working. Despite the vehicle being such a great buy, a company that will not repair or replace such an important safety piece is terrible. I would have to tell anyone who is considering buying a Nissan Altima, do not do it purchase a different vehicle. I could not recommend this vehicle to anyone and be able to sleep good at night. I hate to leave such a bad review on such a great car. For the record I have verified several times with Nissan Corporation and the National Highway and Transportation Safety that my specific vehicle is not on their recall list which would then require them to fix the airbag defect under their warranty this was a brand new car purchased, within 508 miles the defect appeared the vehicle has been reprogrammed and recalibrated several times Nissan Corporation States as long as their computer does not read the defect they will not be fixing or repairing or replacing anything on my car. Despite six videos of the defect in action a service advisor witnessing the defect as it was occurring and documenting that he saw the defect and several service managers as well as mechanics stating that they are aware my car has a defect but Nissan has no clue what to do keep in mind they sold me this car four days before they announced their National recall and to date they have no resolution for the problem. Don't take my word for it, don't take the dealerships or Nissan's word for it look it up online we're in an information era all of this information is publicly accessible.",4

The comfort of this car is amazing starting with the zero gravity seats. I drove a Hyundai Sonata and the ride and seats are like riding over rocks, very stiff and very strong odor of plastics inside and very slow. The Nissan Altima has excellent power and fuel economy 41mpg in the highway and is fast compared to the competition, due to the light weight of the car. I drove 5 cars of the competition and for price and the reliability of Nissan I bought this car. The CVT transmission is a dream, very responsive and quiet, this is not my first Nissan anyways, I had many of them in the past with 0 issues like Nissan Sentra, Bluebird, Sunny, Junior, Bluebird Ateza Awd, Stanza and others.",5

Foster ,2016 Nissan Altima  2.5 S 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Decent," I would describe my rental Altima which I have for 3 months as competent.The exterior is styled nicely, the interior is functional but plain.  I do appreciate the comfortable elbow rests.  The 4 cylinder engine is powerful enough but struggles up hills.  The CVT works well and you can get up to speed pretty quickly, but there is an artificial shift feeling.  The steering is light and handling is just ok, the car has Hankook tires on which ride nicely but lack grip.  The cloth seats hold up well, the ride is fairly comfortable but gets choppy sometimes.  There is some engine growl but otherwise the car is quiet.  Mileage is around 31 mpg combined.The Altima is certainly a good car, it just doesn't feel special.  Unlike say, my previous Accord which I just liked to get into every day and drive.  The Altima doesn't have that.",4

One needs to keep the high beams on at night in order to drive safely.now I have 24,000 miles on it. Not one problem.  I’ve been using Mobil one synthetic for the last 24,000 miles.

86, on 04/01/16 09:24 AM (PDT),michael yarber ,2016 Nissan Altima  2.5 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),"10,000 mile updae"," 10,000 miles update and the car is still performing well.  The milage has increased to over 30mpg as an average.  We have gotten up to 41mpg on a trip to Indianapolis (from Nashville, TN) averaging around 75 mph.  We have three recalls on the car, nothing major and will be taking it in soon.  Overall, I still gave it a high rating.  What?...traded the Accord for an Altima, yes, you heard right.  Why, the main reason for me that the seats in the Accords were not working for me.  In a recent long trip from Nashville to Richmond, VA., I had to get out the car three times going and coming back.  My was seat was hurting.  I do have some health issues, but it was enough to start looking.  Went around trying out cars out, like the new Civic, H-RD, and some others and the seats were not any better for me.  I went to a Nissan to dealer to set in a Rogue first and then a Altima and WOW.   These zero gravity seats are really true, they are comfortable!  We went for a drive and I like the drive also.  The SV model had everything we were looking for in a car (except the NAV package, I use my iphone for maps).  My wife chose the color, Pearl White, and we got a really good deal with the trade and the new car!  We only had the cars for a few days, but I think I am going to really like it.  The seats are really something and even the back seats are great!  Ironically, I just toured the Nissan plant in Smyrna, TN this past Thursday (I live 4 miles from the plant) and was really impressed with the mile long production line and the quality of the production.  If guess time will tell.After 25k on the car, we still like about everything.  It is very comfortable and a quite ride and the gas milage it great.  We are getting anywhere between 29 and 32 in the city and 36 plus or so on the highway.  The only thing I don't like is the CVT.  It has power but not as responsive as I would like.  But I knew that going in.The 2019 Altima (debut at the New York Auto Show last week) has a new engine with 250ish horsepower replacing the V6, I am sure that would be a great buy.  I believe it comes out in the fall of 2018, I think.",4

89, on 03/02/16 09:03 AM (PST),JCon21 ,2016 Nissan Altima  2.5 SR 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT),1 Year UPDATE I Love My 2016 Nissan Altima 2.5 SR," I absolutely love my 2016 Nissan Altima 2.5 SR.   I was in the market for a mid-size car, and didn't know where to start as I have only owned trucks my entire life.  I did a lot of research online on Edmunds, KBB, and The Car Connection before going to dealerships.  I pretty much made up my mind on the Altima from the first test drive.  It just looked and felt great.  The Altima handles great, the SR model looks sporty yet classy, and the comfort is a solid 10 out of 10.  I still cannot believe how comfortable the seats are.  Not only in front, but also in the back.  I have a sore lower back that always hurts when sitting, and honestly it does not hurt in these Anti Gravity seats.  Also it is so roomy, even in the back, and I'm 6'1"" and 240lbs.   Also the trunk has a lot of space.  The only real complaints I have about the car is that there is a fair amount of road noise, but I think it may be the stock Dunlop tires.  I've been thinking about getting some better tires to see if it would help.  Also the nissanconnect stuff is pretty worthless.  I can only use Pandora, IHeart Radio, or Facebook.  I don't subscribe to any of those apps, but do subscribe to spotify which streams great through bluetooth audio.  I think they should add some useful and helpful apps like google maps, waze, or yelp.Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase.One year and 8500 Miles later Update!!!I have owned my Nissan Altima 2.5L SR for a little over one year now.  I just wanted to update my previous review.  I still absolutely love this car.  I did have to take it into the dealership to get some recalls fixed, but they were not affecting the vehicle yet I just wanted them fixed.  One thing I did after purchase was put new Pirelli Cinturato P7 All Season tires on the car, which cut the road noise down by more than half.  Those stock Dunlop tires were terrible, and had to sell them cheap because nobody wanted them.   My MPGs have stayed around 30-32 in mixed driving conditions Highway and City.  On the Highway I have got as high as 42MPG on a long road trip non-stop and in the city with a lot of stop and go traffic as low as 26MPG.  Overall am very happy with the MPG this car gives me.  As for the ""Technology"" the bluetooth/handsfree has really worked flawlessly for me.  It connects to my iphone 6s everytime and once I had it set I can drive and not worry about picking up my phone even when I get text messages or emails.  I do still wish nissan connect app would add something more.  It is really a garbage app.  If I could see maps on the screen through my phone it would be not only convenient, but much safer to the driver and passengers.  I am sure it is possible with a hack or something, but I don't know how to do it.   The keyless entry, push start, and the FOBs are really nice as well.  Never having to use a key and just leaving the FOB in your pocket all the time makes it just that much more convenient to get in and out of.    The interior is still very new looking and the seats are as comfortable as the first time I sat in them.  I test drove a Toyota Camry SE with my wife the other day(Price is the only reason we can't get another Altima at the moment) and it felt terrible IMO compared to my car.  The only real complaints I have other than the ones I have already addressed are 1. Changing the oil is kind of a PITA because of the mud shield on the bottom of the car.  2.  In high sunlight conditions its hard to see well because the dash reflects back on the windshield.  3.  The wiper blades don't do the best job of clearing the windshield and the washer fluid tends to spray more on the side and top of the car then on the windshield.  4. Center console storage needs to be addressed because when you have car chargers plugged in it makes it difficult to have anything stored there and reach easily.  I also need a place to put my phone besides the cup holder.  I'm sure I could find a few other things to gripe about, but overall I really still love my car and am very happy with my purchase.",5

They put a recording device on my car after they couldn't find the problem, and the problem stopped. Come to find out, the device is made by the same company that manufactures the transmission! I think that device actually fixed the problem. As soon as it was taken off, the problems started again. Not only that, when you press the brakes, the car does some type of rolling thing before it actually stops. It is hard to explain. It does not stop like a regular car.

The high quality of materials, fit and finish is exceptional for the price and the versatility of the vehicle is endless.  We especially like the way the instrumentation is laid out and ease of reach for all features.  The GPS is awesome and the large screen shows mapping with great ease and details.  Music experience is awesome as you can adjust every aspect of your music experience.  I especially like the 'all around' cameras, as it makes parking in the garage a breeze and warns of vehicles to close to you on the road... a great safety and convenience feature, which is enhanced with the large screen with sharp picture.  Leather seating is supple and the seat heaters (and steering wheel heater) work very well.

Like the title of this review states... after extensive research, we found our winner... and it has proven to exceed our expectations and has friends wishing they had one.",5

Comfortable, drives well, decent fuel economy, and I have not had any issues in 2 years. If you want to save money and get a large SUV that is functional and performs well without trips to the dealer, look no further. If you own it for 3 to 5 years the resale value is not too bad either. Remember you did save a lot off the sticker when you bought it.",4

Roomy and comfortable.   First time owning CVT and I’m so glad I gave it a try.   Great acceleration and no jerky shifting.   Paint finish is amazing too.    Let’s hope the honeymoon continues,5
115, on 02/28/18 08:57 AM (PST),Roman Longoria ,2017 Nissan Pathfinder  S 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),2014 S 2 wheel drive Pathfinder," Overall happy with the vehicle. Had for 3 1/2 years. Ready to trade in for another one. Only slight problem was every time I would back out of my driveway and shift the vehicle from reverse to drive then accelerate I would here a very slight popping sound. Took it into Nissan and they replace something that had to do with the transmission CVT. However, it still made the sound. By the way Nissan has great service. (Ed Hicks in Corpus Christi, TX.)",4
116, on 02/20/18 18:31 PM (PST),Scott ,2017 Nissan Pathfinder  SV 4dr SUV 4WD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Cross Country Tow & Mountain Tour Test Scored A+," I've had this vehicle now for 15 months and I have grown to enjoy it more and more as time passes.  The latest test was a 4000 mile RT on I-80 towing a loaded 5' X 8' U-Haul trailer in February and a mountain tour in the Rockies.  The car did everything well.  Mileage on the road is excellent for a 4600 lb. vehicle.  It cruises well and the engine is responsive at all speeds, likely because of the continuously variable transmission.  The CVT took a while to get used to, it is the first one I have owned but with a strong 3.5 liter V6 engine there really are no drawbacks and the associated fuel economy is a bonus.  The car tracks straight on the highway and was virtually unfazed by 40 - 60 mph cross winds even towing the trailer; very stable.  And the automatic 4WD coupled is a very secure experience driving over icy patches in a stiff crosswind on the high elevation interstate in SE Wyoming.  In light slick snow the traction is very secure; you can see the rear wheels kick in when cornering and not have to worry about fishtailing.  Ride is good but not cushy comfortable; there is a firmness to it and you can feel the bumps.  The OEM Michelin Latitude tires soften impacts however and they have great traction in wet and snowy conditions.  In the mountains I was extremely pleased with the suspension, handling, and steering; no body roll and a firm grip on the road.  The CVT was also very satisfying descending steep grades; all you have to do is push a button on the shifter to take it out of overdrive and let the engine do the braking.  The SV model comes with cloth seats which were very comfortable on the 8-10 hour drive days.  NIssan could do better with the quality of the cloth but the surfaces were soft touch and we didn't want to pay for leather in the SL trim.  We have been extremely happy with the cold weather package (front seat heaters and heated steering wheel) - I was shocked that I could buy a heated steering wheel for such a reasonable cost on a lower trim level (although packed with value options).  We were attracted to this model first by the spacious middle seat and large doors.  The seat is wide to seat three medium sized adults, sits up a bit higher than the front seats and has outstanding legroom like most of the cars from the 50's and early 60's had.  The third seat is really for kids or petite adults but when folded down provides a large cargo area which we used on our two week trip.  When the third seat is set up my wife likes the size of the reduced cargo area when stowing groceries but some may think it is too small.  This model was freshened for 2017 and Nissan seemed to do a good job correcting all the model's driving weaknesses that I have read about.  I looked at the 2018's and discovered that there are hardly any changes so all my comments should apply to the current model year.  We plan on keeping this vehicle at least seven years as we enjoy driving it, the car is very functional for what an SUV should do, and the first two seat rows are so roomy and comfortable.  I wasn't sure I would like it this much when I purchased it.",5
117, on 01/28/18 06:12 AM (PST),Sully  ,2017 Nissan Pathfinder  Platinum 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Great platinum trim level," Bought the wife one and two years later I get the same exact one just a little newer. You do have to adapt to the cvt and understand where and when the ""gears"" will change in order to continue accelerating through the roads so it doesn't downshift and rev up. The vehicles are great value. The best leg room of any SUV on market and that's a fact for both front and rear seat. Both the 2015 and our 2017 had hood issues. When going over 70-80mph on interstate, the hood would look like it's going to fly up and off so we took them in to be tightened. The 2017 platinum sits a little squatty like and people flash me a lot thinking I have my brights on. The headlights are extremely bright and you can tell when on low beam they're a little high. Feel bad for some oncoming drivers. City/highway avg 19.5mpg at 14,000 miles. ",5

I love the vehicle style, aside from several minor squeaking issues in the moonroof and back panel and behind driver's seat.  I guess I just got a lemon!

127, on 06/20/17 17:14 PM (PDT),Mark Howell ,2017 Nissan Pathfinder  Platinum 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Nissan Pathfinder Plat vs. Honda Pilot Touring," 3-months ago I bought my wife a 2017 Honda Pilot Touring AWD and today offloaded it to the local Nissan dealership for a far superior 2017 Nissan Pathfinder Platinum AWD midnight edition with family entertainment. Why you might ask? Because the technology in the Honda Pilot is far inferior than that of the NPF. Why would you put a rear seat entertainment system in a vehicle if you can't control it from the drivers seat. Ask Honda. It was impossible to start movies from the front of the car, which is completely useless. Why would you force a phone call made from your iPhone into what they call ""private mode"" and NOT let it play through bluetooth. Google this if you're comparing cars right now because it is a huge, known problem. That makes no sense. Finally, why won't you let us disable the engine auto start/stop feature through a setting rather than have to turn it on and off every time you start the car? Stupid feature, popular in Europe but what's the point. So you know what the Pathfinder does? Let's you control the rear seat entertainment system from the driver's seat, puts all calls through the bluetooth unless you decide to make it a private call, and doesn't shut your engine off at a light. Oh and the interior is awesome, ride is better and it feels like a much more well thought out vehicle. Add to the that Nissan rebates right now are the best in the market. I highly recommend this vehicle. If you're in the market and thinking about the Pilot, be wary of the technology.",5

Venegas ,2017 Nissan Pathfinder  SL 4dr SUV 4WD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Great SUV," I use to wotk for Nissan and after years of going back and forth with the wife about her van...now I own what I consider a well built car. I've owned mine for about a year, it's got great acceleration. That and being teamed up with the CV trans which just builds torque with no shifting is unbelievable. I have done some towing and had no issues with lack of power. I bought the SL trim package which has extra USB ports, towing, and front and second row heated seats plus more. The pathfinder had some redesigning done which actually makes it more appealing.  The ride I consider very smooth but getting use to the location of some of the creature/comfort features will take some time. The audio is great, 13 speaker Boss system, Nissan always seemed to put good stereos in their vehicals. So far this SUV is great! I would highly recommend the Nissan Pathfinder to anyone looking for a well built vehicle for a great price.",5

131, on 02/25/17 06:04 AM (PST),Graydon ,2017 Nissan Pathfinder  SL 4dr SUV 4WD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Great features; great price; very nice ride!," We were looking for a three row SUV that has good gas mileage, towing capacity, and value. The final two that I considered were the Pathfinder SL with the Tech package and the Toyota Highlander XLE trim. These have similar MSRPs to they should be comparable. The Toyota puts their advanced safety features (lane departure, collision mitigation, etc) on all trim levels. Another good thing about the Toyota was its auto stop/start feature. It was hard to notice when the car shut itself off and started back up again. On the other hand, Nissan gives you a lot more for the price. Some of the features on the Pathfinder that were not on the similarly priced Highlander were the around view monitor (my favorite feature); heated second row seats; heated side mirrors; heated steering wheel; remote start; a premium Bose sound system; driver seat position memory. Another cool feature on the Pathfinder is that when you shut off the car, the seats moved back for ease of exit. When you start it back up again, the seats move into position. A couple of small negatives. The Pathfinder has a lot of power, very quick from a stop light. However, the driving ""feel"" isn't like the Mazda CX9. They supposedly stiffened the suspensions, but the ride still feels very soft to me (some folks might prefer this). Also, it is a big car, so definite body roll around the corners. So its not going to feel like a sports car, but if you are looking for a good three row SUV, this is a good choice. Also, we were able to get this car for around 3K lower than the Toyota dealer was willing to go. Really loving this car!",5

The exterior look was also a factor when we chose this over Honda Pilot. There are lots of Pros if you are looking for a sizable car and here are some Pros: It is very spacious inside. The S Trim also has a touch screen but no useful apps. All the fancy big screen is for radio station selection and climate controls. We played around with SV and SL trims and we weren't impressed with the apps included in them.,3
136, on 01/16/17 13:38 PM (PST),Waxahachie Woman ,2017 Nissan Pathfinder  SL 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Going on 2 yrs," I don't think I've had the car long enough to rate it on some of things asked above, but so far, I really like it. It is very comfortable and I do like the way it handles while driving....there are a few things I am getting used to such as the the back up camera. I was wanting a Ford Explorer but I think I came away with more for the money. I am hoping to get better MPG, but I think that has to do with getting to know the car.*** I've now had the car for a year-and-a-half and while I still like it, there was a problem with the screen. Unfortunately the dealership did not follow through when I first reported the problem due to some changes in their personnel. Therefore I fell through the cracks! When the part was finally ordered it took a little more than a month to get it so I was without radio, Bluetooth, and all the other things that go with the screen on the dash. I tend to keep my vehicles for a long time so I figure that if there is going to be another problem it will be when the car is 2 years old. At that point I will know whether or not I will ever buy another Nissan. And just to demonstrate how long I keep my cars, I have a 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid that I kept for 10 years and have passed down to my son and that car has hardly ever given me a problem.",4

I have the platinum package with the entertainment system in the rear seats.      Overall I am very pleased with the quality especially the interior which is comparable to a luxury vehicle. I checked out most competitors to include the Mazda and Toyota. The pathfinder had the most features I wanted such as cooled seats, panoramic roof and DVD system for rear seats. Something my daughter loves, she love looking out the roof and watching the monitors. The ride is nice and firm, just how I like it, the transmission is smooth and engine strong. What sold me on the pathfinder is the amount of features it includes such as safety features and the fact Nissan is aleauvs willing to make a deal to sell car. Toyota wanted to knock off 2500 off sticker on a 2016 while Nissan knocked off about 7k on a 2017 which was just unloaded and still wrapped in plastic. For 41k or thereabouts the pathfinder wins hands down",5

So please be extra careful. My car is under warranty so Nissan is fixing it for free but  won’t fix it once out of warranty. If you don't care about fuel economy and power then this will be the best suv for you. Bluetooth pairing is very bad i like ford sync better. Max MPG i may get is when i put the car in 2WD mode. NISSAN says that AUTO mode does change the drive mode to 2WD for higher MPG but this is not true. I hope nissan gets away from CVT transmission some day. The latest i heard is nissan dealers are trying to get ride of this vehicle from their lots by reducing the prices  eg a sales rep went from 40K to 32K in less than 5 min for a platinum 4WD.

We have owned it for 7 months, have put 15,000 miles on it and have never looked back. No rattles, no annoyances, no strange blind spots for the driver, MPG as advertised or better, nor any other quirks which nag at you making you think -- did I make the right choice? We got the Platinum trim, which essentially is a discounted Infinity QX60. This SUV has serious get up and go, looks sharp, and is a joy to drive. And it is supremely comfortable for long road trips (we did a 1,600 mile round trip visit to CA from our home in SLC area, including a 7 hour traffic jam out of LA to Las Vegas with two kids). Sound system is fantastic (Bose), and driver controls are logically laid out and easy to use (knobs, ergonomically friendly buttons on steering wheel, etc.). You can with between 2WD, all wheel drive or lock in 4WD. We had heavy snowfall this year, and with Bridgestone Blizzaks and the Pathfinder's automated power distribution and 4WD we carved up serious winter driving conditions with ease. If I had to nitpick one area where I think Nissan can invest more -- it's the navigation interface-- which is completely serviceable, by the way. That said, I've rented cars with Apple CarPlay (Audi, Ford) and I'm not experiencing worlds of difference when it comes to navigation. We get 19-20 MPG driving kids around town and getting to ski resorts (and there is a lot of climbing !)...on long road trips, we average  24-26 mpg.  We certainly recommend this SUV..btw, we researched the heck out of the Pilot, Kia Sorrento, Ford Explorer, and smaller SUVs as well (and test drove the Pilot and Sorrento).",5

Note it isn't filled with options the ones I miss are a power drivers seat, auto lights, towing package, and a backup camera. I put a after market hitch and a wiring harness on it for about 160 dollars( it comes with a tranny cooler from the factory) and a aftermarket back up camera for 100. It drives nice is comfortable and im getting 25.4 miles to the gallon combine driving.

The performance is poor.....is a V6!, this should have more power when riding on the highway. The seats are uncomfortable. not enough specs for the price. Rogue should be a better option. I do not recommend this vehicle. Please read my old notes before reading the update. thanksthe first thing that you have to know is that the bluetooth technology that is in the car is the worst! unless you want to spend an extra 10,000 dollars to get the fully loaded version, but then that would put you on high priced vehicle, and with that might price you might be able to get some thing with more luxury. The bluetooth capabilities are just to hear a phone call come in....that is it! You may ask.....what about audio streaming? NOPE, not available. you would have to buy a dongle/adapter for it or some audio cables that are going to be hanging out of your middle console, and look crappy. (yes im picky like that) i just feel that it is not worth the price. my 20,0000 nissan rougue had audio streaming; i paid twice as much for this one. I do not get navigation, so i have 6 BUTTONS from my stearing wheel to the control panel that do the same thing!....... and that is to change my radio station one up......really? I know that my review is mostly on the sound system ...and it is, but i like to go down to the details like these. When i purchased the car i asked if bluetooth was included and they said yes, but i never thought that it would be just for calls. when i told my dealer about the complaint, the sales guy said ""yeah sometimes the cheaper cars have better feautures""....(wow) Also, nissan stated that they spent 6000 just on the entertaining system; mmmm i don't know, you would think that 6000 dollars can get you a higher quality screen for your dash board. there are also two ""back"" buttons, 2 ""settings"" buttons, 2 ""info"" buttons that alone is just 6 buttons wasted. i hope that this review makes sense to you, i do think that the car is a good reliable car, but after driving it for several months, i feel like it is not worth the money that i am paying on it.",2

Sure it has lost some of its off road mojo, but since off road to me is driving down a dirt path going apple picking or skiing – I am have little to complain about.First off the truck looks great.  Beautiful lines, striking paint job that totally pops, beautiful leather seats and dark and useful window tinting – really a great job by the designers at Nissan.  The controls are all well placed and very functional (electronics work very well with wifi and Siri on an iphone) – and as with all Nissans, the climate control rocks.  Very cold AC, very warm heat and strong defrost.  Seating is comfortable, third row is easy to access even with a child seat in the second row, and when the third row is down – I have a ton of cargo space.I am not sure what kind of driving some of these people are doing, but with a good mix of 50/50 highway and city, I am getting 20.5 MPG – which is very respectable for a truck this size.Could not be happier with my Pathfinder.",5

Extremely reliable with great resale value.  Nissan service departments have always been easy to deal with and I have been comfortable with their recommendations. I went with the Platinum trim to get the 20 inch vs 18 inch wheel, which may explain the slight road noise. It took awhile to learn the controls and instrumentation. I like the auto adjust on the steering wheel and the electric seat adjustment on the passenger side as well.  I purchased the cargo protector which unfolds to protect the third row seat also when down; a nice feature. Overall, very satisfied with this purchase and ready to take my first road trip. Update: Took my first road trip and within miles of home picked up a truck tire weight which had worked its way into the center tread on the rear driver's side. The low tire warning worked as expected. Lowering the spare tire was not difficult, but removing and replacing it was very cumbersome, especially working on the side of the road.",5

Mileage is sub-par so far....," Test drove the Mazda CX-9 and Mitubishi Outlander - and looked at the Honda Pilot and Dodge Durango.  Liked the Nissan for plush, beautiful interior the most - the outside is not the best - but not the worst.  The Mazda CX-9 was nice and has GREAT gas mileage, but is actually pretty small and had no discount offers, Dodge was nice but wife hated the look, Honda - not much discount...  Outlander nice but too small.  Nissan was offering 0% financing and a few grand off, which makes it an easy decision.   Got the 4 wheel drive cause it happened to be the only Arctic blue with almond leather interior in the entire area - so we got 4wd with it.  That said, at only 1 mpg difference, I figured no big deal.  WRONG!  We are averaging about 16mpg in San Diego, granted it's mostly city driving, and hilly -- but dang....   That said, it's such a nice driving automobile.  Has such a beautiful, well apportioned interior -- makes it a pure pleasure to drive.  The 360 camera, nice center console, nice sized glove box, easy access to third row from behind passenger seat (magic seat) --  (works even with car seat installed).  Impossible to describe all the 'little' conveniences.  Can see individual tire pressure, car beeps if you add air when it gets to the right pressure, front camera is AWESOME!

Hunter ,2016 Nissan Pathfinder  Platinum 4dr SUV 4WD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),2016 vs. 2013 - Let's Compare," Update to review following question about CVT:No issues with CVT after 10,000 miles. I think the reprogram that added the ""shift feeling"" made a difference when comparing to the '13. No shuttering, hesitation or anything so far.The only concern I have to date is receiving another airbag recall notice from Nissan. Of course parts are not available to fix when we received notice. The airbag possibly not deploying in the '13 is what lead us to the '16. We love everything about the PF and was assured by Nissan that the airbag sensors were fixed for '16. Now I'm beginning to doubt this. If you are considering the PF I can only advise that you make sure the recall has been addressed and hope they have it fixed THIS TIME! Original Review:Having owned identical '13 and '16 PF Platinum 4wd models with every option available I am overall pleased with the quality of this vehicle.  I would almost call it ""Infiniti like"" in its ride/handling and Platinum trim features. The PF uses more interior plastic material when compared to an Infiniti but they do a good job of dressing it up. We constantly receive compliments from friends about how nice the interior of the PF is. I realize every trim does not offer the luxury of the Platinum but if you are able to purchase I think it is a great value when compared to luxury brand vehicles. The 2016 also does an excellent job in refining the little annoyances we had with the 2013. Some of these include: Being able to leave fog lights ""on"" with headlights in ""auto"" position without the lights being on all the time; The rear cargo gate does not beep the entire time going up and down, just a few warning beeps; An updated CVT transmission program that is much smoother.Speaking of the CVT, that was my primary concern with the 2013. As you will see in reviews most people have experienced the ""judder/shake"" of the CVT in their PF. We were no different and the first time I thought the CVT was going to be found laying in the middle of the road, it was disturbing! I played along with Nissan and had every re-program/recall addressed. Things improved but I would still feel a hesitation in the transmission occasionally. The 2016 seems to have addressed this with a new program and simulated shifts. After 1,000 miles on this vehicle, the CVT feels much tighter and refined. Fingers crossed it remains this way. The CVT is likely responsible for one of the best parts of this vehicle.... an observed 19 mpg around town and 24 mpg on the highway. Not bad for a 4wd SUV that can tow 5,000 lbs and comfortably haul 7 passengers. One of the best features of the PF aside from its comfortable ride and road manners have to be the safety features. My wife loves the ""all around view"" monitor and doesn't see herself ever owning another vehicle without it. It is seriously convenient when parking but also a necessity when you have little ones who may be running around. I cannot believe that every manufacturer hasn't included this technology on their SUV line. We also like the blind spot monitoring and cross traffic alert included on our '16. The seating configuration in the PF is genius. Having the ability to slide the second row seats makes the third row bearable to sit it. Speaking of the third row, it really isn't that bad. It is one of the most comfortable we found in a SUV of this size and it can even be accessed while a child seat is secured in the second.     Some shortcomings I've found on the '16 PF include a dated navi system and slow processor when you wish to play music from a plug-in device (phone, USB, etc). I really wish Nissan would have opted for LED headlights or at least LED running lights to keep the PF in line with the Rogue and Murano. The biggest drawback I see to the '16 is Nissan missed the opportunity to update the exterior and prevent a dated look when compared with similar crossovers. With that said, I still believe this is one of the best values available for the money.Having owned a '13 PF for 3 years, the 2016 PF is a nice update that seems to have addressed both the major (CVT) and minor issues found on the '13. When compared to the '16 Explorer Limited we had an opportunity to drive a few weeks, the Nissan still wins. Ford has done an excellent overall job on the Explorer but we find the PF to be more comfortable. For example, I can't rest my arm on the door of the Explorer while driving due to its design and that becomes a major annoyance on a road trip. Also the rear seat design and all-around view monitor (not just front/back) gives the PF the edge. In summary, I highly recommend you give the PF a test drive. Notice the little things that make a huge impact on every day driving and I think you will find the PF to be a worthy choice. Opt for the Platinum trim and you will find very comfortable cabin with all the features you could ever need and an ""Infiniti like"" level of refinement.",5

Earlier the same day I drove the top rated Kia Sorento and the Honda Pilot.  I can say that they are all nice in their own way and all noisy when the engine is pushed.If you want a tight feature packed precision machine with a ton of value go with the Kia Sorento.   If you love the smoothness of a Lincoln but want a more versatile vehicle go for the Honda Pilot: it feels superb cruising on the highway.HOWEVER if you want that illusive ""farfegnugen"" the youthful joys of driving a car that literally MOVES with your own body and sense of gravity...

My wife's 2018 Honda Accord has Apple CarPlay, It is a snap to use use, convenient, accurate, easy to use, everything the Nissan navigation system is lacking.  one other negative; Cargo space with 3rd row seats up, is woeful ( luggage rack crossbars should've  been standard). I have had four other Pathfinders since 1988 - great vehicles. Now for the good news. Excellent mileage, comfortable, easy and fun to drive. Front and second seats plenty of room, and love the tilt down side mirrors feature when backing up, and my wife is all for the heated steering wheel. Plenty of towing power - everything one would expect in a Pathfinder. So, if you have patience for the navigation system and cargo space it's not a factor, this is a great car and except for the lack of AppleCar Play, I be hard pressed not to buy it again.",4

Ride is much improved with greater noise reduction (what I didn't like about the 2015), and the power is always there when I need it. Living in the Midwest, you just don't know what the weather will bring, from driving rains, gusty winds, or heavy snow and that can be all in one week. The Pathfinder does great in all of these conditions and if you have ever driven on Michigan roads, you need a vehicle that can handle the lack of maintenance that we experience.

The truck has the worst fit and finish I have ever seen. The truck was missing paint ( just paint over primer on the passenger side cab, and front and rear doors.) Within the drip panels on top of the truck they missed caulking half the drip panels. And Sloppily caulked the rest They then just painted over caulk. In the bed they didn’t caulk one of the seams in the interior of the bed and you could see daylight down to the floor. . Brought the truck to 3 dealers two of which wouldn’t even make a warranty claim saying that’s just how they build them. Nissan Consumer affairs has switched the regional manager on me 3 times now from Stefanie to Jennifer now to Debbie. They don’t take phone calls and won’t leave email addresses so I can have receipt of contact with them. I went a different dealer other than the one I bought the truck at and they literally laughed out loud when looking over my truck. They made a warranty claim for over $12,000 in body work the truck needed. It is junk just junk. DO NOT BUY ! The truck has can’t be fixed right to factory spec, The only thing worse than the piece of junk truck is their customer service they refused to even send an engineer out to look at the truck I wish I could put up pictures so you can see this junk. Nissans dealer network is a joke. I am left with the decision to let them attempt to fix the truck, and have it look even worse cause even their own Dealers said they could never replicate a factory paint job, or leave it the way it is. Wither way I am left with  truck that has about $7,000 in diminished value given the amount of body work it needs, or the same  amount of repairs that will be visible to an appraisers eye when I go to trade it in.

V8 is amazing! Power to spare.  MPG has been around 15 hoping it better as it breaks in more ....maybe...Transmission is very good not super smooth. a little busy/ hesitant  in the lower gears up until 30-35 MPH . VERY VERY SLIGHT I MUST SAY. Really hate the 26 gallon fuel tank. That's unacceptable in a full size truck. Infotainment system is yes a little dated and small. But works great. Plenty of USB ports and 12 volt outlets. Would love the option of a longer bed on the crew cab Like Ford offers. 5 year /100K warranty is awesome. Drives great on the road. can cruise all day 75-80 MPH on the freeway. Engineers definitely spent time and got the ride right. To my horror i almost drove straight to Costco from the dealer to remove the OE ""General"" tires. However they are surprisingly  very very good. Would buy Nissan again in a second.

188, on 10/21/17 12:12 PM (PDT),Todd ,2017 Nissan Titan  Platinum Reserve 4dr Crew Cab 4WD (5.6L 8cyl 7A),Best deal for the money," I normally dont do reviews, but thought this was worth writing. I own 3 pickups and am not brand dedicated because there are so many nice trucks. I own 3 different trucks. I am drawn to looks first then power and interior. I have notice reading reviews that most want to beat the trucks up, there are no perfect trucks. The Nissan drew me in because it was different and I dont recall any recalls. I owned a Xterra and it was bulletproof and am hoping for the same on my Titan. After looking at all brands and I liked them all, I really like the warranty on my Titan and I got more equipment for the money than the competitors. My first and second tank of fuel at 70 mpg I got 17.5, I was very pleased and when it get broke in I hope for 20. I find it to be very quiet and so were all the others on top of the line. I guess I could beat the truck up with small complaints but sure makes spending my money on it hard to swallow. If the truck last me for 10 years I will be very pleased. I know the ride will get much better as it has in all my cars and trucks in time. I hope you enjoy your new purchase as much as I am enjoying mine.",5

The XD is 1500 lbs heavier than the regular Titan, thus resulting in about 12.6 to 13 mpg around town. However without towing can achieve 16 / 17 mpg on interstate driving 75 to 78 mpg on cruise control.  Transmission is ok, however at slow acceleration  (city driving in traffic) it shifts from 2 through 4th gear too quickly dropping rpm  to near 1500 and loose so much torque it will balk. To overcome the torque lose you will instinctively press gas harder...suddenly you are in 2nd gear at 4000 r.p.m. where it has super power.

The suspension is well tuned for a truck, delivering a highway ride that is second-to-none.  At the SV trim level - comprising the majority of Titan sales - the Comfort and Convenience Packlage provides most of the options drivers want:  8-way adjustable, heated seats; blind spot warning system; rear camera, running boards, and Class IV hitch with 4/7 pin wiring.

I bought it used and put 246000 miles on it with no mechanical issues. I loved that truck and thought it to be very comfortable and reliable. I purchased the 17 PRO4X with every available option and so far I can report that I do love this truck. As others have stated, it is bigger than the older one and requires more turning radius. However, other than that I have had no issues. This one has all the gadgets and electronic gizmos that my 04 did not making it very fun to drive. My only complaint might be the lack of usable space under the rear seats. The new Titan has lockable storage boxes under the rear seats and although a nice idea, they are not really big enough for anything such as tools. I used to carry a toolbox under the seat of my old one. Also, being a four wheel drive I believe the PRO4X should come equipped with better off road tires than the other Titans available. My first time off road against my brothers Tundra was not an impressive outing. The locking Diffs are nice however, more meaty off road tires are needed. Other than that, really great truck. I'm sure i'll be driving this one for many years.",5

At first I thought exterior looks were hands down Old Titan but after driving it I give the new bold, big look a tick under the Old Titan. Interior wise hands down goes to the New Titan. Spacious, lots of storage, comfortable all the way around, materials are great, layout is great just flows with you. Electronic wise the New Titan is upgraded but still has some of the bluetooth glitches occasionally and USB work great if you have an iPod or iPhone. But still has the Rockford Fosgate system that is way better than the Old Titan. I did have to replace front sonar sensor only after 2 months of owning. So I call it a draw. Power wise the new V8 dusts the old V8 and I thought that was a strong motor. The 7 speed tranny takes a little getting use to. Towing is off the chain and 4WD is a beast. Reality hurts when it comes to MPG, but my Old titan wasn't much better. I drive a mixed run of city and hwy and typically every tank of gas is 16.5 to 17.2 depending on if I drive more than the other. I have taken it on multiple road trips and it is by far a better ride, and power than the Old Titan. My only serious grip is that the New Titan does not turn sharp and is awkward in tight spaces where as my Old Titan never had these issues. Overall I recommend it over Tundra, Ram for sure. Just a simple test drive puts it over these two easy. I have driven a 2017 F150 and Silverado 4WD, in my opinion, Titan is very comparable to the F150, maybe a tick above in some cases but a tick below in others, but both of these fall a little short of the Silverado, which right now is top gun in this class. My deal came to financing, in which Nissan had the upper hand. It really is an opinion based, drive them, go from there. The New Titan has definetly come along way.",4

The Titan comfortably accommodates my family of five and our gear for extended road trips. It cruises down the interstate with no effort and handles snow and mud without issue.

Well within one week we started having issues with the parking sensors and sonar warning light staying on. off the dealership with this truck for repair. a day later they state it was repaired and ready to pick up. on the way home the sonar warning came on and the parking sensor error back on. back to the dealership again, this time they said it needed a right frony sensor, it came in a few days later so the truck was left there for repairs, we received a phone call the truck was ready to pick up. we get to the dealership and upon going out to the truck and starting it the same issues appeared the sonar warning and parking sensor errors again, went right back in the dealership and again the truck was left at the dealership, then service calls us and tells us the truck needs to have the sonar module replaced. so we wait and a couple days later we receive a phone call that the truck is all done and ready to pick up, so back to the dealership only to arrive at the dealership to find out that they have the truck back in the shop again for the same issues/problems and we are being told by the service advisor that once again the truck needs more parts replaced with this tome being a pin for a wire harness/connector. what a blow to us. especially when since the first time this vehicle was taken in the service advisor stated that he checked all connectors and all appeared to be in great shape. so now the truck is still at the dealership waiting parts and repair. We contacted Nissan usa consumer affairs division to file for a lemon and a replacement truck, this is pending and takes weeks. the dealership will only do a trade towards another truck which cost us several thousand dollar loss on the trade, NO WAY!  apparently this dealership service has been in contact with Nissan tech dept. and being told try this and that which so far nothing has worked to fix the issues.

After 2 weeks of driving and evaluations, Nissan did an exceptional job of adding many more features.  7 speed transmission was a big hit.  With the older Titan 5 speed it shifted on hills with high rev.  Power was better pulling the RV.  So many new features that was needed was a big plus.  The biggest drawback is the handling.  The steering wheel was very stiff and due to the added size of the truck, it took much more space to turn and handle.  In all I loved the feel of the smaller older Titan but like the more luxurious and more power of the new Titan.  If I was in the market for new Titan, I would really take the time to get the feel of the steering and the new larger size to see if it is worth the upgrade.  I would have preferred little larger than the older Titan with all the new features.  Hope they improve on the size and handling in the future...",3

The range of the vehicle has been around 135 miles, which is greater than advertised. With federal and state tax incentives, a big discount offered by our local utility and our dealer, we paid about 50% of the sticker price.  With our trade in of of 2010 CRV, our out of pocket expense was less that $10K.   The Bose sound system is excellent,  the seating comfort is better than expected and the handling is solid.  But the energy savings are off the charts.  In one month we drove 581 miles and it cost us just $14.00 in electricity counting a few free ""fill ups"" from nearby stations.  We are extremely pleased with the Leaf knowing we are not spewing exhaust into the environment.",5
206, on 08/09/17 13:23 PM (PDT),mike ,2017 Nissan Leaf  S 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),space ship 14 months of ownership/ gettin better.," The worst thing about this vehicle is resale value. You can purchase these vehicles for 1/3 the cost of new, but beware if you get the ""s"" model , you will not get the bigger battery unless it is a 2017 or newer. This larger battery will give you more range. My vehicle, which i have had just short of 3 months, has a range of 112+ miles with a full charge. The charge time is around 14 hours, depending on how much range was left on the vehicle at plug in time, and that is with the normal 110 volt household outlet. This vehicle, in my opinion is not great in any way, such as comfort, dependability, etc., but that it is not why I purchased this car. My goal was saving money on gasoline, oil, maintainence and in that regard it is a GREAT vehicle. It is the perfect car for the way I drive. This vehicle does not like freeways. The range drops whenever you engage the cruise control. The range shrinks much quicker as you increase your speed. However, if you drive the city streets, it is the complete opposite. For example, I drove 18 miles for a doughnut  craving. I had a full charge (115 miles on that day) and when I hit the store I only had 88 left. I drove the return trip on the city streets and when I got back to my driveway, I had 91 miles of range. Yes, that is not an error. I actually gained 3 miles. This was with my vehicle in B mode. That mode is 1 of 2 forward modes the transmission allows. The D mode is the default mode when you shift into forward gear. To get into B mode you double shift. This gives your braking system more regenative power. So, as you drive you charge the battery whenever you release the accelerator or apply the brakes. The range increase is real. I can charge to full and not need a recharge for many days, in spite of making  multiple 20 plus mile trips. In this regard the vehicle is fantastic. In most other area, it is just adequate. It has sufficient comfort in the cabin, enough to allow my wife to be comfortable in it, despite a bad back. The airconditioner is above average, blowing extremely cold after just a minute or two. The back seat is adequate for my 16 year old average size grandson. The rear hatch cargo area is, however, small. Still, to this point, I have not had a problem bringing home the groceries. The cars styling is a bummer. I have plastered a alien sticker on the roof area behind the rear door and have proclaimed the car my ""space ship"". I did not purchase the vehicle for looks. My youngest daughter thinks it is ""cute"". My oldest daughter enjoyed driving it and I think they both are interested in buying one. They have asked me how much it has increased my electric bill and I can honestly say after getting two electric bills since I took possesion, it was less than a couple of dollars more. Maybe I just haven't had the vehicle long enough to evaluate that because even I feel the increase should have been larger, but at this point, it is what it is. The ride of the vehicle is smooth and rattlefree. I have heard the brakes do not feel normal on these electrics. I find them no different then the Cruze that I drove before. I perfer this vehicle over the Cruze in most catagories. I have not used the higher watt chargers that are available to the public so i can't comment on that. Likewise on the heated seats, haven't used them. The sound system is average. I have heard the range drops in the colder months of winter. I will update as my experience broadens. As of now, I am thrilled with the car. It fits into my lifestyle perfectly and using it allows me to put less mileage on my vw van which I take on vacations and for hauling larger items. The addition of a second vehicle makes owning this vehicle a no brainer. Also, the $7500 tax credit makes this car a good value. I was able to get $12K off the sticker at the dealership. Extremely happy with my purchase. UPDATE, I have now driven the car for 7 plus months. My mileage is now at 3789. The cost of driving the car averages $20 per month in AEP electric bill increase. The winter weather does degrade the battery, but only by 10 or so less driving distance. The heated seats are not as warm as the ones in my vw van, but do allow some comfort. Using the heater is a big drag on the driving distance. In a conventional car, once your car warms up you have constant heat on demand. The  Leaf gives heat differently. It requires a warm up time each time you push  the heater button. Also, increasing the temp does not increase your battery drain, so crank it up. When you turn off the heater, close the vents or you will get cooler air coming into the cabin. I have noticed that the initial drop in range does not continue to deteriorate IF DRIVING ON CITY STREETS. However, the combination of using the heater AND freeway driving zaps the battery very severely. Expect to get less than half of displayed mileage. Another negative is because  of the design of the back of the vehicle, this area seems to collect dirt. I clean the back window often.",5
207, on 02/10/18 12:59 PM (PST),Georgiana Maly ,2016 Nissan Leaf  SV 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),Battery Life is TERRIBLE - Don't buy this vehicle," You should know that my Nissan Leaf was supposed to get on a 100% charge, a mileage range of 112.  It's 2 years old and starting after owning the car for a year and a half (18 months), the battery started degrading rapidly.  On a full charge, mileage range was approximately 85 miles and now February 1, 2018, driving it for 2 years, on a full charge, mileage range is approximately 70 on a good day.  I NEVER can use my radio, heater or a/c because the mileage range will drop to 55 on a full charge. I have the 220 outlet for the charger at home.  It gets a full charge within about 3 hours.  If you use the 110, it will take up to 12 hours or more for a full charge.  I am so disappointed in the mileage.  Other than that, I like the car; however, battery life sucks!",1
208, on 12/22/17 12:26 PM (PST),Richard Perata ,2016 Nissan Leaf  SV 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),Don't buy this car - battery degradation pitiful," I bought a 2016 Leaf with extended range of 108 miles after owning a 2013 leaf for 2.5 years with no noticeable battery degradation. My 2016 leaf now has lost 31% of it's original battery capacity after 19 months and 7000 miles. A full charge now indicates 74 miles, however the last time I drove this car I traveled 44 miles round trip and was left with 12 miles capacity when I returned home. Ask yourself if this suits your needs before buying this car. Nissan says that battery degradation is normal. According to Nissan my car charges 9 out of 12 bars on their charging scale and they won't replace the battery until it is at 8 out of 12. I'm stuck with a car with 69% of it's stated range after 19 months and low mileage. Will this car work for you? I can only drive 22 miles from my home if I want to make it back home - pathetic rip off - car is essentially a huge brick with a monthly payment",1

214, on 09/29/16 11:14 AM (PDT),Hardball ,2016 Nissan Leaf  SL 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),Don't be shocked!  It's a great electric car!," I leased my 2016 LEAF about 900 miles ago and I have to say I'm ""shocked"" at how great it is. It's the SL version which means it's fully loaded with all options. The car is well built and very solid. With all the incentives, I got a great deal and will be able to buy it in a few years at an awesome price.Fully charged, it is capable of 125 miles. This is plenty for my daily 40 mile round trip commute. I installed a 240 V level 2 charger myself with not too much difficulty. I'm fairly handy and have a newer home with 200 amp service and spare breakers. I bought the NISSAN charger or EVSE online. I charge the car on early Wedsnesday mornings and again on Sunday mornings during off peak hours. It charges from empty in less than 5 hours but I usually only need about 3 and a half hours to go from 20 miles to about 110. It costs me about 2 bucks per charge. This is easy to do beacuse it's fully programmable. It's incredibly loaded with technology that makes it fun to drive. While searching for an alternative vehicle, I drove the VOLT and Prius. I was not impressed with either one. The VOLT has hardly any rear headroom and is a joke for tall people to sit in the back plus it's a true four seater at best. The Prius was interesting but seemd to lack any pep. The LEAF is decievingly large inside due to its height. It also has great acceleration due to its torque from the electric motors.Driving an electric car is a unique experience. It's silent and smooth. There is no drag when using the A/C and no strain from a gas motor. It accelerates effortlessly, quietly, and smoothly. I don't have trouble with range because there are many chargers available in my area plus at any NISSAN dealer. I still have gas cars for long trips though. But, I don't travel much anyway. I love pulling into my garage silently, having no motor to heat up the garage, no smells from oil and exhaust etc. It requires no maintenance except tire rotations. No belts, exhaust, oil etc. I'm no hypermiler either- don't have to be- I use the climate control liberally, drive at normal speeds on the highway every day, plus I'm a car guy and own a classic musclecar which I drive pretty hard on the weekends. I guess I'm not the typical electric car owner but it's just a blast to drive the LEAF.  It has a nice sized hatch area for groceries unlike the Honda Fit.  The electronics are intuitive and easy to use.  The nav is great and the Bose sound is very good.I would say to anyone on the fence, examine your driving practices and see if it's for you. I should add that the build quality is exceptional and the materials are excellent. I am VERY picky with cars and don't have any major cons for this car. I will say that the center armrest could be improved by making it adjustable to slide forward. There is a little more wind noise than I like but it's a smaller car.  There is no lock on the glove box.  There should be courtesy lights for rear passengers.  I hope this review helps you.*UPDATE* Feb 2017Okay, so I first reviewed this car in September of 2016 so I think it's time to update my review.  I see some people saying some poor things about it but it's not been my experience.  I have almost 16,000 miles on the car from a new lease and have ZERO battery life degradation.  All battery life bars are full as new.  It does not charge to what it did when new (135) but does charge up to 109 which is in line with Nissan's projections.  I live in a Northern cold weather climate and will say that using this car in winter weather DOES affect the mileage rather significantly when driving at highway speeds.  Cons: The use of all the electric accessories in winter weather (especially the climate control) can drain the battery quickly.   At lower city speeds however, I find the effects to be not as drastic.  The A/C in the summer is a high drain on the battery also.  Driving on snow or ice can be especially tricky due to the torque of the motors when accelerating from a stop.  The windshield washer sprayers are terrible.  They are not set up to spray high enough and don't immediately activate the wipers.  No daytime running lamps, headlights don't automatically turn off in the constant ON position- they could potentially be left on though there is an alarm.  Pros: no gas or maintenance other than tire rotations.  Powerful headlights (SL).  Great Bose stereo (on the SL), EFFORTLESS electric power steering, nice leather, navigation is excellent, easy Bluetooth, lots of media options, heated steering wheel is AWESOME, I have no complaints with the heater, surprisingly roomy because of its tall cabin, jackrabbit acceleration.  This car is not for everyone.  It's NOT a highway car for sustained drives.  It is ideal for close to home driving, running errands, grocery shopping etc.  Forget about unscheduled impulse drives however because you have to take your range into consideration.  If most of your driving is close to home this car could be perfect for you.",5
215, on 09/14/18 07:46 AM (PDT),Brian ,2018 Nissan Leaf  SV 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),Best 2nd car I've ever owned.," Let me start out by saying I'm not what you would think of as a typical EV owner.  I'm not some tree hugger out to save the planet.   My motivations for buying this car were purely economical. I'm also 6'3"" tall and about 240 lbs.  This car is very comfortable for me.    I can't recommend the leaf car enough, but there is of course one small catch.  For most of us the leaf cannot be the primary family vehicle.  I'm a father of 2 living in a suburban area.   I fly a lot for work but my office is less than 10 miles from my house.  For around town and to the airport this is absolutely the perfect car.   The one problem is of course the range and charging speed.  If this were the family's only car we couldn't take this on vacation.  If my destination is over 50 miles away I don't feel comfortable taking it with the family.   While 150 miles is a real number in city driving range it is more like 110 in highway driving (if you drive 75 like most of us).   Those are the downsides.  The upside is that it is great to drive.  Great ride, great acceleration, corners nicely.  But most importantly I have NO gas or Gas equivalent bill.  Nissan includes 2 years of free charging at every major charging network.   I have a charging station in my parking garage at work.  I have never once charged this thing at home.  I have actually used many fast charging stations.  When I go into the city (which is about 75 miles away) I stop at one of the fast chargers on the highway and grab dinner / lunch on the trip in or out.  In 1/2 hour I can charge about 80 miles worth of charge.  I've never had to wait for a station to be available.  Also, the scheduled maintenance on this is really a joke.  It consists of rotating tires, checking the brakes and replacing your cabin air filter ($12 on amazon).   I got my SV for 30000 out the door including sales tax.  7500 federal and 2500 state credits brought that number down to $20000.  I can fit my 2 small children in their booster seats easily in the back.  The trunk has plenty of room for a Costco run.   I get compliments on the looks of this car almost every day.  Its not a Tesla but its a sharp car.  Previous generation leafs were kind of weird looking to me.   This is a much better looking car than the Bolt. Anyway, if you're in a position where your daily commute is less than 100 miles round trip, and you have another Car in the family for longer trips, I can't recommend the leaf enough.",5
216, on 09/11/18 10:58 AM (PDT),Valerie ,2018 Nissan Leaf  SV 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),I liked leaves before but now I love my Leaf," I was very unsure about the ride and comfort of an electric vehicle until I actually test drove one.   Wow is this care roomy and comfortable.   I hated driving before but now I leap to drive my Leaf.      I am so relaxed driving this car.   I have owned a Silverado Truck, FJ Cruiser, Audi, 750il and out of all of them my Leaf hits the top of the trees in all over performance and comfort.     So glad I made my leap to the leaf.",5
217, on 08/18/18 13:12 PM (PDT),Jim ,2018 Nissan Leaf  SL 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),Not turning over a new LEAF, Great economy and performance. First thousand miles required $25 of electricity vs $75 in gasoline for an ICE AT 30 mpg. E pedal is great for hilly driving. Poor cross traffic alert system. No hooks for bags in cargo area.,4
218, on 08/15/18 16:35 PM (PDT),Tim ,2018 Nissan Leaf  SV 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),Leaf is a great car, This car is a lot of fun to drive. The charging station is a bit pricey. The included free charging does not work with all public charging stations,5
219, on 06/06/18 15:40 PM (PDT),Steve ,2018 Nissan Leaf  SL 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),100% torque 100% of the time, Unbelievable acceleration in normal mode and very easy to go from econ to zoom.,4
220, on 05/25/18 16:44 PM (PDT),Dan ,2018 Nissan Leaf  SL 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),I want to like this car," There are some things prospective buyers need to know.  The range is overly optimistic--I am a smooth--non-hot-shot driver--I get about 120 miles on a charge--not 150.  Be wary of planning a trip that involves hills--the incline eats energy.  The car is very comfortable and the interior--while not a wow factor is well above average.  The problem?  NISSAN dealerships and support.  After only 2 weeks the pro-pilot assist went out, and the pedestrian braking never worked.  One dealer had it 3 days saying they were waiting for Nissan corporate to look at it--but couldn't say when that would be.  I returned it to the dealer where I purchased it and have been told it will be 7 business days to get a new sensor that ""might"" fix it. I called Nissan EV support--the first complaint never got logged--the second one did, and at least they have agreed to reimburse gas.  I will be without my new car for at least 2 weeks because of weekends and a holiday not included in the business day estimate.  So, maybe when I get it back if it works as it's supposed to I will like it...but at this point I wish I had put those dollars elsewhere.  I paid cash",3
221, on 03/26/18 13:52 PM (PDT),Phil Easler  ,2018 Nissan Leaf  S 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),Fantastic car," Electric car driver since December 2012. This is my 3rd leased/purchase ev. Great value, I got the quick charged option and heated seats/ steering wheel out the door for $22K.  I don’t need to charge it up every day, but when I do the guess o meter ranges from 160 -187 so far.  I have owned or lease the vehicle for about 1.5 months and have around 1300 miles on the clock. You will need a 220/240 charger to get the most out of the vehicle.  Charges at 6.6 kwt/ hour ~ 22 miles of charge per hour from a 240 dedicated charger. I have only fast charged it at two Nissan dealerships twice. It put in around 15 kwatts in about 30 mins about 50 miles of driving.  Hoping to see 200 miles on the range meter this summer!!",5
222, on 06/26/18 21:53 PM (PDT),Jose Acevedo ,2017 Nissan Sentra  SL 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Huge Mistake," I will never buy another Nissan, I am so disappointed. I bought a brand new Sentra not even 6 months after owning this vehicle I had to take it in for repairs for what I am certain was a Transmission, well they said there was nothing wrong. Few weeks after that same issue so I took it in again and they said oh it's the Mass Air Flow Sensor. Well a month after that same problem, take it in again and they say oh it's only an Oxygen Sensor I believe they said and replaced it. Well guess what? Month later I am driving with my wife and 2 young children ages 11 & 6 on a very busy 4 lane highway suddenly same exact issue car will not accelerate above 35 MPH and then stalls out in the middle of the highway causing my family to literally miss getting rear ended by a Semi by maybe a foot, again I was nearly certain it's the Transmission have it towed there and again they say no, this time it's the Throttle Body. I have wrote corporate, my local dealer ship and all they keep saying is the Warranty is now up, however, if the problem persist the will cover it. I am literally petrified to put my family back in this 🍋 lemon and now it literally sits in my driveway reminding of what a poor brand is. Bought the vehicle brand new and for 2 years it's been in the shop half a dozen times or more for the same issue that they keep saying is something else when I am certain it is the transmission, so I am stuck with a lemon and the payments on a lemon that myself nor my wife are comfortable driving for fear of the next close call with a semi becoming reality thanks Nissan for refusing to admit it's the Transmission and replacing every part in the car but the transmission.",1
223, on 03/12/18 08:19 AM (PDT),Robert Q ,2017 Nissan Sentra  SR 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Not your Granny's Sentra," A nice middle of the road-no pun intended- sedan that ,remember, is an economy car not a performance car. But this is a nice riding, good looking car that exceeds the earlier iterations by a mile. I have not had it long enough to know about how reliable it will be, but so far I'm happy with it. Do not know the resale value yet.",4
224, on 02/09/18 10:25 AM (PST),Bray ,2017 Nissan Sentra  SV 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Should have bought the Altima, Had a 2008 Sentra for 10 years with 34k miles and decided to buy a new one. Test drives never tell the story. What a huge mistake the CVT is the worst I have ever experienced and the engine is ridiculously NOISY. Wife got an Altima the same day and I should have gotten one as well. Its not the greatest but certainly better than the Sentra.,1
225, on 01/28/18 10:39 AM (PST),Andrea ,2017 Nissan Sentra  S 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Fred Flintstone had a better car," This car is slow. Pushing it up a hill would be faster then driving it up a hill. Terrible mileage. I am at a gas station gassing it up so much, I should be charged rent.  Absolutely no power, I am so disappointed. I wanted the Juke but got bullied into this piece of sh** by the Nissan dealership in Hayward,  CA. I have never hated any car as much as I do this car.",1
226, on 01/07/18 16:36 PM (PST),Kathy ,2017 Nissan Sentra  S 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 6M),Underrated Sentra," I was going to replace my older Altima with a new one, but ended up buying a Sentra instead. The handling is great (better than my Altima) and actually feels sporty. Vehicle is so quiet in the cabin you can't tell it's running. Trunk space is good too for its class. Only thing I miss with the Altima is the large gas tank which can get about 600 miles on one tank and the wider interior. I bought a manual (I prefer to drive stick) so can't comment on the acceleration with the CVT. For a compact car, I'm very happy with this purchase, and think the low ratings from car critics aren't that accurate.",4
227, on 12/30/17 09:04 AM (PST),Rich Rausser ,2017 Nissan Sentra  S 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Nissan Sentra S shines as a daily driver," I’ve been driving a brand new 2017 Nissan Sentra S for the past two months and 2,000 miles while my DD is in the shop for some work. I must say that I am impressed with this car as a daily driver. The car is comfortable and quiet. The seats are amazingly comfortable and they provide good lateral support for those of us who like to corner a bit harder than most. One really outstanding attribute is the fuel mileage. I can’t seem to get less than 38 MPG in my daily driving. When I really flog the car hard, my mileage drops to 34 MPG which is still very good. Oh, and on highway trips to Jersey, I’ve been able to get 49 MPG if I use a light foot on the gas. And one more thing, while the car is not super quick, it is more than adequate in normal day-to-day driving and the CVT transmission also works well with the power output of this engine. All-in-all, this is a very good car, and this comes from a guy who drives a BMW M2 on a regular basis. ",4
228, on 12/25/17 19:34 PM (PST),Bryan ,2017 Nissan Sentra  SR TURBO 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Cost Cutting ruins an otherwise great car," With the stick, is very fun to drive despite having the wrong gearing for the powerband and notchy shift action. No limited slip diff for some reason, even though this is the juke powertrain, which comes with the LSD standard. This car looks upscale and the interior is very nice. Unfortunately, this is thin veneer over a very cheaply made car that in my opinion will not last for the long haul. Feels substantially less well put together then the last generation sentra, which feels built like a brick outhouse. This is confirmed in that the 2007-2012 sentra weighs 150lb more despite being smaller than the 2013-up model.  I am a mechanic and bought this car not only to improve my credit, but so I wouldn't have to work on my own car, as I spend 60 hours a week most weeks working on other people's cars. Less than 100 miles into my purchase, I noticed 2nd gear was very hard to engage. Had to bring it to the attention of the dealer 3 times before they confirmed my findings (defective transmission). After that they replaced it with no issues. I have had the car for a year and have put only 5600 miles on it so far, and already the body is starting to loosen up, various squeaks are manifesting themselves. The body simply does not feel very solid at all. My mother owns a 2008 sentra, with over 180k on it and it feels more solid than my brand new car. I know this because I service her car for her. Yes, I test drove multiple 2017 sentras (after I was already committed to mine, unfortunately,) and they are all the same. If I would have known, I would have saved myself over 15 grand and bought a 2012 sentra (the last year for the old bodystyle) from Copart and fixed it, because that's how flimsy this new car feels to me. The car is otherwise great, I average nearly 33mpg average around town and have touched 54mpg on one particular back road trip!  My issue is that I don't feel it will last long. Cost cutting abounds everywhere. The interior is about the only place that they didn't try to save coin....it is very nice. Everywhere else the cost cutting monster has had it's way. The ride is nice, until you hit the first big bump, and you run out of suspension travel (something the previous sentra did very well was absorb bumps.....) Open the hood or trunk and you are greeted by great swaths of metal that Nissan didn't bother painting body color (to save on paint)...all you see is the base coat. What paint is on the car is very thin and very easily chipped or scratched, which was never the case on previous Nissan products. I already have chips on almost every body panel which are down to the primer. Remember, this is a NINE MONTH OLD CAR with 5600 gentle miles on it. The driver's door already closes with a different sound than the passenger's door. It sounds tinnier, as if the weatherstrip is already wearing out. The rear brakes squeal when stopping, i feel like I am in one of those old 1950's TV shows every time I stop. The sunvisors buzz incessantly against the headliner at idle and the package tray rattles. Again, most of this stuff is nitpicking, but still, when a NEW CAR has more NVH problems than its 10 year old sibling, that is saying a lot, especially when the old car has 11 times the mileage. It is a great car to lease, not to buy, in my opinion.",3

Stodgy but has tight handling, you feel the road (which I like). Also like eco setting, interior, trunk space, good visibility. Little info given on how to use infotainment system. Navigation not as good as WAZE but oK. Screen good but can't use usb port for phone without losing sound??",4
231, on 10/18/17 14:43 PM (PDT),Ted ,2017 Nissan Sentra  SV 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),No refunds. No returns.," We purchased it because we couldn't find the Toyota we wanted. It was a mistake. Their warrantee  will be voiced for almost anything. ie if you don't get the oil changed on their schedule BUT some of them say change it every 3500 miles some say every 5000 miles. If you choose incorrectly your warrantee is voided. After one day, we took it in because the brakes were spongy and made a slight noise when stopping. They said nothing was wrong with them. We said we wanted to return it, and they refused. A Toyota corolla for approximately $1000 more has everything the Sentra has. To have the safety features that the Corolla has would cost $4000 more.",1
232, on 09/28/17 00:57 AM (PDT),Sue ,2017 Nissan Sentra  SV 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),"Disappointed with this car,"," I owned a 2011 Sentra and although I didn't find it very comfortable I was happy with the way it drove so I decided to upgrade to a 2017 SV Sentra.  Although I am happy with all the new safety features such as the backup camera and blind spot warning lights I am really sorry I bought this car because of the transmission and acceleration.  It seems they ""improved"" the CVT transmission in 2012 and now the car is very slow and unresponsive compared to the 2011.  On long trips my leg hurts because I'm having to push so hard on the gas peddle to get it to respond and it is very dangerous merging and passing.  Also the cruise control doesn't work on even small hills which is very annoying.  As soon as I pay down my loan I will be looking around for a better, safer car.",2
233, on 09/27/17 01:54 AM (PDT),David ,2017 Nissan Sentra  SV 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Better than the reviews had me believing," Its really comfortable to sit in and easy to drive. I am a large man and can drive for three or four hours at a time without complaint.  Reviews say it lacks power and if you are looking for a sporty car this isn't it. That said, the Sport mode gives it plenty of pick up on demand and being able to turn it off means greater fuel efficiency. The back up camera is good but not great and the sound system even in the SV is very nice. I love the keyless entry and start button. Reviews say it lacks styling but I could not disagree more. I think it a very attractive car. My only real complaint is that it seems to have a pretty large blind spot on the drivers side. the Bluetooth and Siri connection work flawlessly and the hands free phone is easy to hear and those on the other end hear me quite well.",5
234, on 09/21/17 07:46 AM (PDT),AugustRush1993 ,2017 Nissan Sentra  SV 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Consider getting a sentra!," Previous Vehicles Owned: 2010 Sentra SL, 2013 Nissan Cube; To begin with, the Nissan Sentra is not a race car- do not have that expectation. While I personally would like more horsepower, the Sentra is adequate when you use the ""Sport Mode"" option. It takes some time to get used to Nissan CVT engines, but you will adjust. I was very skeptical of buying a 2017 Sentra, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The 2017 Sentra is very refined, since this generation was first introduced in 2013. Some improvements are; refreshed exterior styling (very attractive), more sound deadening materials, new SV packages. (I highly recommend getting the ""SV"" trim level, and adding the ""Style Package"" for $750.00, you will get alloy wheels, moon roof, and a few other things.) When it comes to my driving, I currently drive 140/miles daily to work and back. This vehicle is more than capable of city, highway, and mixed driving. Regardless of what other people say, the engine noise is not that bad. If a driver is treating this car like a racecar and slams on the brakes, then yes you'll hear the engine. The interior room is sufficient- the truck space is exceptional. To the best of my knowledge, the rear seats have more legroom than any other vehicle in it's class. Overall, I would recommend this car. The 2017 Sentra is a very refined and well-built vehicle for the money. I purchased my Sentra at Nissan of Keene in New Hampshire. (great dealerships, I recommend checking them out, I drove three hours to them because good dealerships are hard to find).",5
235, on 09/10/17 08:02 AM (PDT),Tim ,2017 Nissan Sentra  SV 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Superior performance and headroom in comparison," Shop the price.  We compared jetta , jeep , kia soul, forte,  sentra sv showed better quality inside and out.  Comfortable compared to VW jetta with a bigger cabin,  and better quality interior.  You cannot beat the smooth ride in comparison to the other vehicles we drove.  Best value, and the only auto dealer that DID NOT switch up the eprice. Honored advertised price, Salesman @ Peoria Nissan were more knowledgeable than at other 5 dealerships here in A.Z.  Love the Sentra SV.",5
236, on 08/31/17 18:42 PM (PDT),Jane ,2017 Nissan Sentra  S 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Nice Small Car Overall," I went from a 3.5 engine to a 1.8 so I'm still trying to get used to it. I wish it had more power when I try to accelerate on the highway. Can be dangerous when your are entering freeway!!! Becareful! After all it is a small car. It gets you from point A to point B. Good for driving locally. Has an OK interior and really spacious for its size.  I dislike the suspension!! U feel every bump really hard and loud! If you are driving in a smooth road you will enjoy it! About 34mpg...I will get LED lights on my SV. Sound system sucks. I hope I can get to upgrade that soon somehow. I hate the wheel covers something I didn' really pay attention to until after should have gotten the rim wheels... Overall, I would recommend unless you have a heavy foot!",4

238, on 08/02/17 07:49 AM (PDT),Sally ,2017 Nissan Sentra  S 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 6M),That emergency brake HAS to be ON........," I am single and leased the vehicle because the salesperson was great at what he did and helped me get a vehicle even though my credit was not good.From the beginning I noticed that, on acceleration, there was the feeling that the emergency brake was somewhat engaged.......very draggy and dull acceleration.  The car lurches at times (automatic transmission) and that is not a good feeling when I need to   GO.     The interior is black and very cheaply constructed.  Just vacuuming it is difficult because nothing wants to release from the fabric.   Nylon of some kind.   It's awful.   The mats and floor carpet are cheap and also are also VERY difficult to vacuum clean.  The construction of the driver's  seat hurts my right hip.   The GOOD parts of the vehicle are the huge trunk, the nice styling of the outer body, and that's about it.   It is difficult to get in and out of.  There is no odometer to reset once I fill it up.  The gas tank is too small, yet it does get good mileage.......have to fill up every few days......and of all the crazy things, the gas tank opening is on the PASSENGER side of the CAR.   I am NOT HAPPY with this vehicle, yet am grateful to have it, given my credit situation.    But if you can get a Altima or better, do it.   I had a 2005 Altima that was still going strong this March when I was hit and it was totaled beyond any hope.      But it was an awesome vehicle all the way around, and I    LOVED    it and am still saddened that it is gone.    Altima is great.",2

All of the technical bells and whistles work fine but the engine is VERY LOUD.   It gets even louder when you try to accelerate .  Acceleration is slow so you have to wait until all cards near and far have gone by to change lanes because it moves very slow and the gas peddle seams as though it is pulling back when you try to press the peddle down harder.  Cars constantly ride up on the back of me while I'm waiting for it to finally speed up It's been to the shop 3 times since I purchased it but the mechanics can't find anything wrong with it.  I've only had it for 4 months and I can't wait to trade it in for something more dependable.  Very frustrating.,2
240, on 06/19/17 23:34 PM (PDT),PaulC ,2017 Nissan Sentra  SL 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Very comfortable front seats," In an age where nearly all car makers offer only hard, thinly padded front seat bottoms that induce fatigue and soreness on longer drives the Nissan Sentra impresses with a seat bottom that fells softer and is shaped and padded in a way that doesn't cause pressure points and fatigue.   Other characteristics of the car are just ordinary except for road noise which is suppressed better than in most midsize cars.  I like cars with comfortable seats, and a bump absorbing and quiet ride and in the midsize category I find the Hyundai Elantra the most desireable overall, the Nissan Sentra second place, Toyota Corolla third place and Chevy Cruze fourth place.",4

252, on 03/02/17 18:45 PM (PST),Rob ,2016 Nissan Sentra  SV 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Most Who Review For A Living Lose Touch Sometimes," I read reviews on cars in this category before I went searching and, unlike Edmunds review, most have the Sentra as a near last ""resort"".  I went to a Nissan/Kia dealer and drove a Sentra after being shown one.  It was attractive enough and felt comfortable so I drove it and ultimately bought one.  I was proud of the deal , but before taking delivery was wondering if I made a mistake given the reviews I read.  Now that I have owned it long enough to be objective enough, I can say that I made a good choice, not just because the price.  It is not flashy by any stretch but, again, looks good.  The compliments I have got on the look (gunmetal with the tinted windows) have been surprising.  The interior has really grown on me.  For me, it is give and take with net ""take"".  The radio display is not the largest and does not have the best display (with the radio on), but sounds very good (it processes the XM radio signal very, very well).  The reverse camera is very clear.  The climate control area does not have a fancy layout and that has grown well on me.  No having to examine the area to figure out how you want to set it.  The drivers display has grown on me, too.  The large speedometer and tach are great for driving.  The 5"" drivers display is a standout.  The SV doesn't have all of the functions, but is enough and the color display is pleasing.  The gas mileage has been better than I expected.  Pretty darn thrifty.  It is a slow accelerating car with a small gas tank, but the cost of driving it has neutralized the lack of acceleration.  I am a bigger guy and find the seats very comfortable.  I found them comfy when I drove it relative to other cars I drove.  They are not sport seats, but for me do not need to be.  Just nice cloth and really comfy.  The one thing that stood out when I drove it and has remained my favorite part of the car is the steering wheel.  This is a car I paid a little over $16,000 for and considering the price the steering wheel is of a sport diameter and thickness.  The steering and handling are not sporty but the car it rides smoothly.  Quiet in the city, quite a bit of road noise on the highway.  The Conti tires may be part of the reason.  i had them on my previous car and interior noise went down a lot when I got new tires.  Overall, my Sentra is quite the nice car to spend my days in.  I drive quite a bit.  A lot of car magazines rip the car for what it is missing.  My perspective is, it deserves kudos for what it does give, quite a bit of passenger room, nice ride, maneuvers well, a feeling of safety, comfortable seats, simple dash and controls (a stately look), great instrumentation, very nice gas mileage and a fantastic steering wheel (the first time I have ever admired the feel of a steering wheel on a car).  The ease on the pocket book when buying one is a bonus.",4
253, on 02/23/17 13:57 PM (PST),Dwayne Evors ,2016 Nissan Sentra  SL 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),All Grown Up!," I have owned three Sentra's. A 2004 2.4 SR which would move pretty well, but did not get good mileage. A 2012 SR which had a smaller engine, got better gas mileage, handled better and was a good step up from the 2004. And the 2016 SL I have now which is really a nice car. I have owned the Lexus 300 series, 400 series, Camry XLE V6, Nissan Altima V6, 4, Toyota Avalon XLE, Nissan 300ZX, Corvette, just to name a few cars, but this Sentra is really a good upscale feeling car with a touch of luxury and I can't believe I said that. I know that feeling goes away when you push the accelerator to the floor because then you know it is underpowered a bit, but until then and while driving on the highway and around the city it can make your think at least in the leather of the SL that you are in a little luxury sport car. Not bad for a Sentra!",5

255, on 12/18/16 11:48 AM (PST),Gabriel Welch ,2016 Nissan Sentra  SL 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),My First Nissan," My boyfriend and I decided to lease a 2016 Nissan Sentra SL after our Volvo left us stranded a couple of times. The price was right at $210/month with a 36,000 mile lease. The car has a sporty look to it and is definitely an eye catcher. It stands out from other compact sedans in its' class in my opinion. The cars performance is pretty great too. The acceleration could be a little better but I guess that's the sacrifice you make to get 30+ miles per gallon. The handling and braking are phenomenal. Speaking of braking, did I mention the car stops itself? The safety features on this thing are insane! The intelligent cruise control and frontal collision detection have saved me from an accident on more than one occasion. The back up camera and blind spot monitors are also quite helpful. The Sentra's audio system is amazing. Our's came standard with Bose speakers and bluetooth. I think our Sentra has a better quality audio system than my relative's brand new BMW! We have already put 3,000 miles on our Sentra and have experienced absolutely no problems. This car is unstoppable! And that is a hard thing to say about a car when you live in a place like Vermont where the harsh winters are enough to stop a 4WD SUV.  We might even buy it out at the end of our lease.",4
256, on 12/13/16 08:09 AM (PST),Samantha ,2016 Nissan Sentra  SR 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Wow. I made a mistake.," This is the 4th Nissan I've owned. I stuck with them because I have loved my Nissans, and I am all about brand loyalty. My last (2013) Sentra was pretty great, so I decided to go the same route with this one. unfortunately, not only did the dealership stop being helpful once I signed that paper, (and at times were actually detrimental to the process, verging on rude and ignoring my requests to get my contract and financial paperwork (Which I don't have 45 days later), leading me to miss my first payment) but this car is awful.  The navigation system turns off about 500 feet before my destination, leaving me to guess or impede traffic to try and see house/building numbers. The USB has to reload my USB drive (where I listen to all my music) every time the car starts, and skips the music as it ""index""es 1-3% at a time (and sometimes doesn't at all). Most of the time I reach my destination before I can actually enjoy any of my own music.  The dashboard is half pointless, as it took me almost an hour to figure out how to scroll through the settings list. The center console is half the size of my last one, but there's a huge space between that and my cup holders- what a pointless design. The buttons on the steering wheel are tiny, leading me to question how those with large hands or fingers are able to hit one. EVERY TIME the temperature is under 40 degrees F, I get an Alert saying there are cold temperatures outside--underneath the temperature that is stationary. So if the winter temperatures affect the performance in my car so much that I get a warning about it...I LIVE IN NEW YORK, and am extremely disappointed. The acceleration makes my car sound like it wants to die and is working twice as hard as it should be (I am not a slam on the pedal type of person). The windshield wipers don't lift up due to a design mistake- again- living in new York with ice and snow, this is a MAJOR flaw. Driving over 20 mph, my passengers side whistles and I feel like a dog listening to a high-pitched sound (I don't know if it is the window? mirror? Having the window doesn't change it or alter the noise, and I have to turn on music to be able to drive long distances without going crazy from the whistle. The blind spot notifications and back up cam are great- there was a big improvement over the 2013, and I love the pockets on the front of the seats. However I'm not joking when I say if I could turn it in now, I would. I hate this car, and I will never purchase another Nissan thanks to this experience, car, and the (and the previous for same attempt of purchase) dealership I worked with this year. After 11 years of owning Nissans (and another 3 in the future of leasing this POS), I'm upset about every single interaction that has taken place, on top of the car. If the car were great and the dealership sucked, whatever. This car is awful. I absolutely do not recommend it, and if you HAVE to get a Nissan, go for at least the Altima.",1

The best feature is the interior room and trunk space. The next best feature is fuel economy.   Don't be afraid to get the 6 speed manual transmission. It is smooth as silk and allows you to baby the engine or squeeze some power out when you need to.   I know the CVT auto's claim to fame is better acceleration and economy but at what cost??  The CVT likes to rev the engine up pretty high even below 20 mph just to accelerate faster. I keep the rpm's lower with the 6 speed. And by the way I get above the 35 mpg rated highway mileage cruising on the interstate. On a 400+ mile trip I averaged over 40 mpg at an average speed of 65 mph (traffic slowed me down some). In any event the Sentra 6 speed manual gives you a lot of bang for your buck in a reasonably roomy family sedan.  Don't expect a lot of fancy electronics. Options and controls are basic but uncluttered and easy to operate.",4

I'm looking forward to driving it myself - I've only ridden shotgun, but it felt tight and composed for an economy car.

It was the lamest car I ever owned (slow, no style, low tech even for then).  Forward to 2018, when it came time to turn in my leased 2016 Jetta Sport for a new compact car.  We tested the usual suspects: 2018 Honda Civic Turbo, 2018 Mazda3, 2019 Jetta.  The Civic was by far the best car, but Honda dealers believe that their cars are made of gold, with diamond accents (first quote for basic turbo sedan, no money down, was $580.00 per month!) so the Honda was eliminated.  The Mazda3 was a nice car (I had previously leased THIRTEEN Mazdas over 20 years, so I'm a fan) but didn't really feel impressed.  The 2019 Jetta was nicely done, but the weak engine was a turn off.  Finally, we went to our local Nissan dealer where we leased a 2017 Maxima (great car) at a fantastic price.  My wife again suggested a Sentra, except this time the SR Turbo. A winner!

The inside is awesome and the outside is very sleek and cool looking!! However, at 16,000 miles and 9months owning it I’ve had to bring it to the dealership for several small but strange issues. The black piece behind the passenger window just fell off, the cruise control toggle has cracked where the silver piece is, the plastic lining that protects the front window from shattering if hit came loose and the entire window had to be replaced, there’s a rattling in the passenger side that won’t go away even after the dealership “fixed it” and the paint on the corner of the bumper just under the hood where it connects to the front headlights has begun to chip. This problem is actually not as weird as possibly shady on the part of the dealership. They say the bumper is lopsided due to the car running up on a curb so the painted piece is rubbing the light and chipping. I went back and looked at the video I made of my car a few days after purchasing and sure enough you can see the bumper is off a bit. Looks like it happened at the dealership before I bought the car. So this problem is still pending. Idk if I got a lemon or if others have experienced these weird problems as well.

End 04/17 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Maximal in my blood!, I love this car it really gets with the program and consistently gets over 30 mph but I do live way out in the country no city driving.I like the CVT transmission and love the all leather interior. Your vision out the rear sides could be better.The instrument cluster had to be replaced about 34000 miles but warranty took care of it quickly and gave me a good loaner for the two days it took to get the new one and install it. I continue to love the car especially on the country roads that I mostly drive on.,5
283, on 01/28/18 16:21 PM (PST),Yuriy ,2017 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Upgraded from Maxima to ..... Maxima," Was planning to upgrade my 2008 Maxima to Lexus IS, Acura TLX or Infinity Q50s.  Drove all these cars and upgraded to Maxima 17 Platinum.  Decision factors are unparallel seat comfort and the features for a price.  Lexus was lacking seat comfort for a taller person with longer legs.  Accura was just OK and exterior/interior were not appealing to me ( other people may like it).  Infinity I really liked, but for $15K less I have got a very competitive car.  What I sucrafised is AWD and a bit sportier feel of the ride.",5
284, on 01/27/18 16:32 PM (PST),Tom Collins ,2017 Nissan Maxima  3.5 S 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Great car with some minor issues.," I've had this car for about a month now and have now had sufficient time to judge the Maxima on its merits. Everything is in its right place in the interior and materials (even on the lowly ""S"" trim) are first rate and very attractive. The cockpit feels like a cocoon designed to envelope the driver and ensure passenger space and comfort. It's not a Maybach inside, but it's big enough and larger than most non-SUV autos these days.  The CVT is surprisingly easy to get used to and acceleration is ample even when you're already going 55mph.  Front wheels could use a limited slip differential, though - as it's really easy to break the tires loose on less than level surfaces, off-camber turns, and when punching the accelerator - either moving or standing still. It would also help with higher speed cornering performance, as there is a vagueness to the steering and lack of a feeling of 'connectedness' to the road in the Maxima.  This is a drive-by-wire/steer-by-wire car if ever there was one and it feels like it...it's not easy to know what the car's actually doing when you're driving at the limit in less than optimal conditions, so best not drive this vehicle like a Porsche Panamera or BMW M3/M5. It's not that kind of car. Otherwise, literally and I mean literally, my only complaints about the Maxima are fuel economy and the sunglass holder above the rearview mirror. I'm getting about 19mpg in city and highway driving, which is not acceptable and the little holder for sunglasses is so tiny, you can really only fit a pair of reading glasses in there. What a waste of an easy to execute item! Again, though, I love this car for what it is and will enjoy driving it while I own it.",5
285, on 01/12/18 18:07 PM (PST),T Field ,2017 Nissan Maxima  3.5 SR 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Fun car to drive but it's not a 4DSC!," Bought this car, the SR version, for my wife on Black Friday, Nissan dealer had some REALLY good incentives, and so far it's been a lot of fun to drive. I told her the SR model didn't ride as well as the other models but she didn't care she loved the color. I was happy because it comes with features she'll probably never use like the SPORT button, which changes the steering, throttle response, and it has Paddle Shifters, which surprisingly even though it has a CVT transmission, feels like it shifts gears slightly and has 7 speeds. Overall the car rides pretty well. On choppy roads however it's no Lincoln. I haven't pushed the car that hard but it handles very well for a FWD car. As other magazines have said, if it was RWD or AWD it would be more sporty. As far as acceleration this car is pretty darn quick. We have about 2000 miles on the car and I'm averaging 28.9 MPG. It records best mileage and on one trip I got 35.2 MPG! Very surprised, however I've already replaced the air filter with a K&N OE replacement type which I'm sure helped mileage. My son, for Christmas, bought me a set of LED driving lights to replace the Halogen fog lights in the front. Looks very cool and because we live in Southern Arizona we never get fog anyway. The interior is probably the best feature in this car. The SR version comes with better seats, which are heated and cooled, half leather and half a type of cloth, which in Arizona is welcome for me, an upgraded Bose stereo which sounds real good. Never was a Bose fan but this car changed that. About the only feature you can't get on the SR is a sunroof which I don't care for anyway. I think we'll get many happy miles driving this car. By the way I'm above retirement age but still love to Drive a car!",5

291, on 10/20/17 03:08 AM (PDT),Jason R. ,2017 Nissan Maxima  3.5 SR 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Broke all the rules with this one!," I swore I would Never buy a new car. I also swore to never spend $35k on any car. I broke both of these rules after my girlfriend brought home a 2016 SR as a loaner while her Rogue was in the shop. We both fell in love with the handling and style of this car and we both end up buying one. Hers is a blue pearl SV and mine is pearl white SR. The SR has a stiffer sport tuned suspension which I love, but beware of this before buying as some may find it a bit too stiff. The car has great power and looks. After nearly a year of ownership, I still have to turn around and stare as I walk away from it after parking. I have had more compliments on this car than I ever have with any of my BMW's, Mercedes-Benz etc. I have had people try to take pictures of my car while driving down the highway next to me! Coming from a Lexus LS430, this was a bit different as it is more sport and less luxury but I love it nonetheless. I average 26-27 mpg every tank and the car has more features than you can shake a stick at. The other day it said one of my tires was low at 28psi (temperature change with fall setting in). The other 3 were at 29psi so I stopped to air them up. The car will actually honk at you when you reach the 33 psi level the tires are supposed to be set at while airing them up. I couldn't believe it! Also, if it is really hot outside and you remote start the car, the A/C will automatically run on high to cool the car down, even if you shut the car off the last time you drove it with the blower off. In the winter months if the temperature is below a certain degree and you remote start, the heat will come on and the heated steering wheel automatically activates. This car is SMART! So many features that once you have them, you will certainly not want to be without after being spoiled with them! The LED headlights are great also but only come standard on the SR and Platinum. I added a set of LED's to my girlfriends SV for $50 aftermarket which was not bad. After 7K miles with this car I have nothing bad to say about it. I normally go through 3-4 cars a year but this one has made it nearly a year and short of finding a killer deal on a Porsche Cayman, I foresee keeping this car a while. I'm sure I am missing more good to say about this car. If you research these cars you will find that the designers at Nissan sculpted this car after the design team spent a day with the US NAVY Blue Angels team and took styling cues from the jet fighters. The cockpit portrays this in every detail as well as the outside of the car. I came from high end German cars but I was blown away by a Nissan Maxima! Ha!",5

Filed a lemon law case with Nissan. Don't get me wrong I love the car - beautiful inside and out. But from day one the glass panoramic roof would pop and crack over bumps and turns... eventually the whole roof was replaced because they couldn't solve the problem. Now entire car rattles, pops and cracks. my roof isn't mounted correctly and is protruding in the back where the rear window meets it. When on the freeway the the car is extremely loud (like the window or sunroom are open) I believe it is due to the roof issues - because I don't recall this issue before the replacement of the roof. The rattling and popping is driving me insane - can't wait to get this replaced or my money back. this is my 4th Nissan in 20 years... huge fan of the brand - never had any issues with Armada, Altima and older Maxima.

297, on 07/11/17 17:51 PM (PDT),Jerry Bloch ,2017 Nissan Maxima  3.5 SL 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Maximize your ride! Fast and Ferocious," First, we rented this for a week in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It was driven dry, rain, no snow and we are from Florida. Beside, I always tell my grandchildren who weren't brought up in snow, its a highly over rated substance. Therefore, I can only comment on the conditions I faced. Ok so the trunk isn't cavernous, The rear seating may be less roomy (who gives a flip), we typically drive with just the two of us. My height is 5' 10 1/2"" bopped my head once too often until I figured it out ( please bring back the Chrysler 300E). The the rear vision isn't spectacular, yet hardly a deal breaker. I currently lease a Subaru Crosstrek with Eyesight and before that a BMW 328i, and 3 cars ago a Kia Sorento SX. When I came to the lot  to pick up the car I was impressed that Hertz gave me a  very nice car. Upon entering the vehicle I thought it was my BMW on steroids cockpit wise. I thought I was in a $50K+ car. All of the controls were similar to my Subaru and highly intuitive and well positioned. Im a big guy and the seats were the most comfortable I have experienced since I wasn't so big. Im first and foremost a sport car person so you know that even though I love my Crosstrek the acceleration can be measured on a calendar which is a drag for me. The Maxima's acceleration off the line,(i.e. a hole shot) was spectacular as well as the 60-90 passing. Ok where does my Kia come in, glad you asked. My Kia had perhaps the worst torque steering I had ever experienced in a vehicle! Previously, I had had a Mitsubishi Lancer with a CVT once mastered it was very fast off the line and torque steer was significantly reduced.Yes it had torque steer, however it was easily over come to provide brutal acceleration within my Maserati  tastes and Nissan budget. Brakes and handling were also very good to excellent. The nav system is every bit as good or better than our portable which was proven out by mile markers, I was truly impressed. I did miss the paddle shifters in my Crosstrek which are needed because of the weak brakes. The shifter was great and it was intuitive and not backward as on the BMW.I don't believe the cons on this car are enough for me to look elsewhere, you know I already did and no other package in its class and price range came close in HP, cabin and standard features. The fact that the blind spot monitor lights are in the cabin is a huge plus when trying to keep your eyes on the road. I don't know if Nissan has a system equivalent to Subaru's Eyesight, as all the jargon used in the auto industry to describe the same features is mind boggling.I am looking forward to leasing a 2018 if the opportunity is right.",5
298, on 07/10/17 14:10 PM (PDT),Gino Piscopo ,2017 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Maxima should be Minima.," Drive an Audi, Mercedes, Lexus, or BMW and you won't even consider a Maxima. I drive professionally and this car is simply lethal. Terrible roadholding especially if roads are wet, useless in snow even with 4 snows, wonderful engine but simply overpowered when considering its inept chassis, the CVT is atrocious, lazy, and then overwhelming. Hang on if you need to pass quickly on a narrow road, torque steer will send you off into the weeds. Regarding the transmission it failed yesterday and needs to be replaced...20,000 miles!  Front seats are exceptional, especially the drivers side as it is fully adjustable. The front passenger seat does not have a height adjustment so your passenger will be sitting on the floor. $40,000 and the power seat doesn't raise? The interior is spacious and of high quality. Exterior styling is quite unusual, Nissan needs to hire new engineers and stylists. The paint work and finish is terrible. My car is the poster car for orange peel.

The Engine? Fine, too much power for front wheels, but this is only really evident when you go to pass someone and fight to stay in the lane.  The seats? Adequate, I have sat in better for a similar price point, but they are OK.  The electronics?  So far the radio system has shut off 3 times for no reason, requiring me to pull over and restart the car to reboot the system.  The included apps are (is) a poorly functioning google search app which rarely works and will not dump info into the navigation.  As for the others (iHeart Radio, TripAdvisor, Pandora, etc) at least they are no longer lying to me that the car is too advanced for the app and they now say that they won't support them.  The key fob will unlock the car, even start it from across the parking lot, but when I get in, it fails to recognize the key.  This usually requires me getting OUT of the car, digging out the key and pressing the start button with the key.  (This is a failure which is taking every once of self restraint not to drive this piece of *^^% into the showroom, especially when it happens in the rain)  The rear deck buzzes with loud music, sure the BOSE system is nice, but if it cannot go loud, what's the point?  Last but most certainly not least is the garbage front end collision system.  This is the thing in the fancy commercial bringing the car to a stop when plywood forms pop up in the road.  Well... It does work, even when there is nothing there.  Boy, I tell you!  If you're ever driving along the highway and you get lulled into a sense of peace and tranquility of the open road, nothing like the car slamming on the brakes (even for 1 second) to wake you up.  Boy, howdy, that's scary.  I own the extended warranty to 120000 miles, so I'm stuck with this car for a bit, I'll just make a pest of myself at the dealer.

No issues whatsoever in driveability or performance.  Instant acceleration, no droning, no problems.  Very comfortable seats, beautiful interior.  The exterior styling is very cool and distinctive, although it may not be to everyone's taste.  I had a 2015 Acura TLX, 4 cylinder base model before this car.  Since I didn't opt for the 6 cylinder TLX, it would unfair to compare acceleration. Could never warm up to the TLX because of the bland exterior and cost cutting.  I am most pleasantly surprised by this car.  The SV trim has everything you need, except that the standard radio in the SV isn't that good, so if I had to do it again I probably would have gone to the SL which has a better Bose unit (although with the price difference I could go aftermarket with the audio and end up better than the Bose).

Here is a different view to them where I agree and disagree.  First, I love the Xtronic (CVT) Transmission.  After driving the Maxima for a while, and then driving other cars with a regular transmission, I love the CVT!!  It is smooth and sounds so much better - so relax ""car pros"" - you think you are sooooo smart to shake your head at the CVT, but I LIKE IT!!  The interior is amazing and the looks suite me just fine.  The handling is good, but I will agree with the pros that front wheel drive can be a negative for some (until you drive in the snow) - and all wheel drive would be nice as well (but would add cost).

308, on 01/22/17 18:40 PM (PST),Reese P ,2017 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Best sedan I've ever driven," Incredible car for the price. Quiet and super comfortable. CVT transmission took a bit to get used to but car is fun to drive! UPDATE after 7 months ownership: The Maxima is in the ""full size/large car"" category along with Toyota Avalons, Kia Credenzas, Chevy Impalas, etc.  The outside dimensions are about equivalent to those other cars, but the interior is at most the size of a midsize car. Having had an Avalon before my Maxima, it has been an adjustment to get used to the reduced cabin and trunk space. Fortunately, I knew when buying that I no longer needed such a big interior. In return for less space you get very thick doors which I believe is one reason the car rates so highly on safety.  Such thick doors makes it a little hard to get into the vehicle. But once inside, the Maxima is beautiful, incredibly comfortable (except for people taller than about 5'11 in the back seats), super easy to use and understand. The interior (Platinum level) is nicer and better laid out than many cars I have been in costing tens of thousands of dollars more. I have never heard a better sound system in a car than the Bose sound system in my car. I am now used to the CVT; when ""flooring it"" the car simulates a regular transmission and with 300 hp has a few times scared me a bit with its pickup.  I regularly get 33 mpg on the highway even at 75 mph. The Maxima Platinum is a luxury car with fun performance and very minor faults. By far the best sedan I have ever driven and an incredible car for the price I paid. UPDATE AFTER A YEAR OF OWNERSHIP: Still the best car I have ever owned. Heated steering wheel is an incredible luxury during winter and warms really fast. Entire car heats up very quickly.",5
309, on 01/15/17 08:51 AM (PST),Ted ,2017 Nissan Maxima  3.5 SL 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Dream Empty Nester Cruiser," This sweet girl is turning out to be everything I had hoped for. Having owned a Nissan Altima SL for the past 9 years convinced me to look hard at Nissan again. By the way, the Altima has proved to be the most trouble-free car I have ever owned. At 125K miles she is tight, uses no oil (synthetic) between 10K mile oil/filter changes, absolutely no rust here in the rest belt. Our previous Accords all rusted sooner or later! Well, I digress. Back to the Maxima. Once I decided to start looking for a newer, more sporty car my eyes fell on the 2017 Maxima and I was bitten before a test drive. I love everything about the exterior design: special likes are the front V-motion grill, front bottom spoiler (designed like the '17 Corvette, it has a kinda stingray shape), the fantastic ""lighted boomerang"" style headlights, and the all glass top (the SL has 2 huge panoramic sun roofs, or is that moon roofs?... always confused by that terminology). Finally, as for the exterior, those 18"" aggressively-styled polished aluminum rims trimmed in black are the bomb. One little gripe here is that those wheels are not tucked inside the tire sidewalls offering almost no protection from curb rash so be real careful with your parallel parking. I'm still in the break-in period so I have not put my foot into it yet although I did hone-out a few demo's and was very impressed with the off-the line and running 30mph acceleration. Some writers complain about the torque steer with full-pedal launches but I did not notice a problem with that. The V-6 engine is Nissan quality so I expect zero problems with seeps, leeks, oil consumption and the like. As for the CVT transmission, well as I said I've owned one for 9 years now and I just love this tranny. Some writers complain about rubber band launches on hard and continuous acceleration. I agree that the old 4-banger CVT exhibits that a bit but the very good ""immediate"" acceleration, lack of shift ""bumps"" experienced with non-CVT transmissions, and better gas mileage more than make up for basic CVT characteristics. Now I was just talking about my old 4-cylinder, 182HP Altima. The new Maxima CVT is a no-shifting dream and once you push the ""Sport"" button on the console, the transmission mimics a standard automatic to a high degree. If you want to feel ""shift points"" then that is what she mimics and the seemingly endless rush of ""pushing you back in your seat"" acceleration is amazing from this 300HP V-6! Now about the interior: This is the most ""sport esthetic"" sedan I have owned and for comparison I also own a '95 and'07 Vettes so I know what a sport interior is all about. As soon as you open the door you are greeted with miles of beautifully contrast-stitched leather seating everywhere and as I sink my 5'9"", 170lb. frame down into (but not much) what Nissan calls ""Zero Gravity"" seats I feel the seats were custom designed for me. There is a pull-out seat extension on the front of the driver's seat which tends to distribute my weight over more of my butt and lower thighs. I'm sure this is going to be a very comfortable long-distance cruiser because the feel is similar to the Vette and I can drive all day without cramping up in that. As I said leather is everywhere and just about all major ""touch points"" down to the bottom of the door arms rests are all stitched soft-touch materials. Nissan has done a wonderful job with the interior design and quality fit and finish. The Bose audio system is great for my ears and the surround sound and extended bass is perfect to me. The cockpit is very well laid out and reminds me of some fighter jets I've been in. The cockpit reminds me of my Vette, without the poured-in feel, due in part to the upper part of the instrument panel being angled in toward ""me"", and not everyone else in the car. It gives the impression that the cockpit was designed around the driver. The infotainment system in this thing sealed the deal. It has a huge and colorful 8"" audio/GPS in the upper part of the center console and that is supplemented with a huge 7"" engine/car management screen in front of the driver. With the 8"" screen showing a GPS map you can even take your finger and ""swipe"" the map from there to the 7"" screen in front of you! Amazing. I could go on-and-on about the dash layout and infotainment goodies but you'll have to try that yourself because I am getting tired of typing and I really want to get out and drive my new Maxima anyway! One final word: the front and rear seating is plenty roomy for my family and friends. Many have remarked how comfortable and spacious the interior is for a ""sport luxury"" sedan. As for the trunk it is just fine for me and my family. I can easily load my large RC planes in the trunk plus I can pull the two rear seats down to near flat for hauling TV's, bikes, lumber, sleds, etc. Out for now.............",5

End 04/17 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Squeaky Driver Seat," Just bought a 2017 Maxima S at Virginia Beach and 2 weeks later the driver seat started to squeak. The spring in the back area makes so much noise it gets annoying. Every time I move, turn, back up and getting off the car I can hear the springs squeak. I had it serviced at the dealer yesterday and was told they could not do anything about it because it is an a safety issue which to me is a bunch of bull crap. Furthermore, they compared it to another new car and that too makes the same squeaky noise. Is this a design flaw? At any rate I left very frustrated that nothing was done and no resolution offered. So for those thinking about buying a maxima, think twice. Either that or start using ear plugs!!",4

I've had a 1999 Nissan Maxima that went 219k before I sold it, and it was still driving amazing.  I was hoping that this car would own up to the quality and reliability of the 99 I had.  This car has awesome power, great handling, and it feels like you are in the cockpit of a fighter jet with the interior design.  I would say the only draw back with this car is the technology.  The Nissan Connect that comes with the car is not great.  It doesn't sync well with my phone and it isn't updated ever(last update was a year ago).  The styling of this car is fantastic.  It is definitely a head turner and it has the power to back it up.  It has great luxury for an affordable price(if bought used).  I would definitely say this car is worth it and it brings a smile to my face every time I get in and drive it.",5

These seats hug you and it makes you feel like you’re in the cockpit of a fighter jet!  Quality feels very high end.  My only complaint is the Nissan connect system.  These guys have to get it together because they are getting their buts kicked by other companies.  Before buying this car, I looked at a Toyota Camry and HATED it!  No power, and transmission of the 2018 was awful.  We owned a 1999 maxima and sold it with 215000miles, and it was still going strong.  I hope the quality is as good with this car.  So far so good.

But unfortunately it is sort of ruined by too little attention to quality when it comes to a quiet driving experience.  I've never had a new car that has this many really severe and irritating rattles and noises.  The worst, perhaps, is a sound in the driver door or right pillar that starts over 50 mph and is wind related.  I think I isolated it to the rocker panel which must catch wind and then rattles like marbles in a rock polishing machine.  The dealership didn't do a wall job on it, but also didn't solve the problem.  The other two really annoying rattles happen when it gets below freezing.  There is an annoying clack somewhere in the back every time you hit a bump.  It's loud.  I thought it was related to the spare, but it's not.  The third rattle also occurs at road bumps or expansion joints.  It comes from the instrument cluster, and sounds like a pack of Tic Tacs over every little bump in the road.  For me, that is enough to ruin the driving experience.  Despite liking nearly everything else about the car, I probably wouldn't buy another, and this is my fourth Maxima.",3

325, on 01/16/17 09:12 AM (PST),Kurt ,2016 Nissan Maxima  3.5 SR 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Rattling.," I want to start by saying this is my 3rd Nissan vehicle and 4th in the family.  I presently own a 2003 Pathfinder with 147,000 miles with only a malfunctioning fuel gauge. I previously owned a 1991 Maxima which I sold in 2003 with 150,000 miles and my wife drives a 2014 Sentra. Purchased a 2017 model year Maxima SR in October 2016 and noticed a rattling coming from the passenger side of the car in November also an uneasy metallic ""clank"" when coming from the right side trunk when going over bumps on the highway.    Took it to back to the dealership in November and of course they could not identify the source of either of the noise and was told to return if it reoccurs.  The rattling has since gotten worst with the  ""clank"" being about the same.  I made another appointment with dealership but I have very little faith in them at this time..                                     After years of being a Nissan owner I think the time has come for me to consider another brand for my next vehicle. The new Maxima looks very impressive and it handles well and overall I would say a good car, but a constant rattling while driving is extremely annoying and automatically make it a POS",3

328, on 12/06/16 17:22 PM (PST),Kevin Mawhinney ,2016 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Revisited Nissan Maxima 2016/2017 in a nutshell," With obvious reason, purchasing a car can be a big deal, after all it is the second largest purchase an average person will make. Most people going onto the lot are thinking two main things, price and look. If they did their research, a list of requirements will fall into place. With Nissan not releasing a 2015 model of the Maxima, it is for very good reason and the results are spectacular.  Unlike some reviews where they review the low end and work up, I'm going to start with the high end and work down hoping to matriculate the perspective of the other trim models of the vehicle. When I test drove the 2017 version of the Maxima, I was immediately awed by the look of it. It looked very aching to the 2015 concept car that Nissan was going to release, with some minor changes. The body shape is a much more sleek, and arrow dynamic design with the impression that it means business compared to its 2014 predecessor. Opening the door gave me the first impression of the ""cockpit"" that is one step out of the future. Sitting in the ""cockpit"" felt like I was being wrapped up in luxury, with all the electronics smiling back at me, ready to get on the road. Of course I had to take some time soaking it all in, and I took my time going through every detail from the comfortable D-shaped steering wheel that is wrapped up in soft, stitched leather to the center column. Turning on the car brought the steering column to me and the seat to it, adjusted previously to my body size and comfort. And the lights, dazzling displays of all manner of things from sensor read outs, to a very sophisticated control center. Leather stitching all over the place, with accent lighting makes this first experience rather nice. The seating with its exceptional ""zero-gravity"" seats felt like it completely hugged my back, which is very important to me due to my condition. The center console seems complex but I was able to easily navigate and understand it. The sound system with it's 11 speaker Bose surround sound system, auto speed sensing and the ""Driver Studio"" mode that quite literally makes you feel like you are sitting in the front row of a concert. Unfortunately the ""Driver Studio"" mode is turned off by default. Looking up, I find myself once again in awe at the large panoramic dual moon roof. Looking in the back seat, it looks rather comfortable, but I cannot tell because I am currently in the front seat. Perhaps I'll get in the back seat later. After a bit of ooh and awing at the interior, its time to see what the rave is about the other aspect of this car, the performance.  Revving the engine tells you this vehicle is definitely a 6 cylinder and it is ready to go. Upon first applying the accelerator, people will be mildly surprised at the jump into motion as the V6 300 horse power engine spurs the car forward, and man did it move. In ""Sports Mode,"" the maxima was very responsive with the applying of the brakes, accelerating into high speeds, switching lanes and turns. In Manual mode, the shift needs some getting used to as the Gear ratio doesn't really account for much in way of torque at the higher 6000-7500 RPM range, resulting in the necessity of faster gear change in order to keep up with the speed increase to plateau. I'm not terribly technically minded, but basically, I am losing about 3-4 gears of acceleration in order to continue increasing speeds at the higher RPMs.  It isn't until I get to 6th gear do I actually feel the car moving again. If someone can present me with what each gear represents in torque and RPM, I might be able to see why this is the case. Overall the handling and performance was relatively nice, and I let off the gas to ease into cruising mode. This car felt very solid and luxurious and should be considered as the sports sedan, meeting both luxury and sport requirements.",4
329, on 11/03/16 14:27 PM (PDT),Anonymous ,2016 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Lovin' My New 2016 Maxima!," I'll admit, the Maxima wasn't even one of the cars on my list to consider, since I was so hell-bent on getting a Lexus IS 250, Scion FR-S, or Lexus NX300h.  I really wanted a sportier car that was fun to drive with great gas mileage, as I commute everyday, but needed one that could fit at least 5 people.  The Lexus NX300h was at the top of my list since it could easily fit in 5 people and had all the features I wanted, but was a bit out of my price range.  The Lexus IS250 was a lot more cramped and had a lot less features.. and though I REALLY liked the handling and driving of the Scion, much like the Lexus, it had a lot less features and was even more cramped in the rear seats (leg room was next to zero) and was even worse than the Lexus. As I was looking at the Lexus the dealer had in stock, I noticed a Nissan Maxima, which only had caught my eye because of the beautiful color (Bordeaux Black) I went to test drive the Lexus and Nissan and I was completely blown away by the interior, handling and performance of the Nissan.  I test drove the Nissan first and then the Lexus.  The Nissan had so many features that the Lexus didn't that I was sold after I had finished driving the Lexus.  The interior is amazing, and I love the blind spot indicators, as well as the excellent mpg, and the handling in sport mode is awesome! This car is definitely a head-turner and I always get compliments, especially on the color, styling and interior.  The only downsides to this car:  1.) Does not fit 5 people comfortably 2.) The Bose sound system is a little off, as the music tends to fade out at random times while playing music, without messing with any of the controls, but could just be my system. 3.) Navigation could be a little bit easier to use, since it can be dangerous trying to go and type through all the manual input information in different sections for the city, state etc while driving.  I find it easier to use the nav on my phone than the one in the car, where you can just enter the address easily.**UPDATE -- after a few months of driving it, I AM STILL IN LOVE WITH THIS CAR!  However, I do want to add two issues I have had, is the front and passenger car seats and the moon roof.  The seats can be a bit uncomfortable after a driving a few hours in this car.  They tend to make your shoulder hunch a little forward and might make a long drive feel a bit uncomfortable! Also, I had an issue with the moon roof, and after a couple of uses the motor and the bracket broke.  I was able to take it back to the dealer and was able to get it fixed, but because the makers decided to attach the motor to the roof itself, they had to replace the entire roof, which is completely made of glass! Luckily it was covered under my warranty and didnt have to pay the $4,500 invoice. But just a fair warning, buy this car without the moon roof.. that or just dont use the moon roof at all",4

I have driven GTR on the track multiple times and am always impressed. My Acura was out of commission due to the airbag recall and I was put into a Maxima S rental. Needless to say, I was so impressed, that I bought a platinum 2 weeks later. Being a 40 yr old Engineer, I am very particular and can say that Maxima provides the best 4 door performance and comfort for the money. Strong acceleration, quiet and soft ride, good fuel economy and excellent fit and finish. CVT is very smooth and provides nearly instant acceleration at any speed similar to driving an electric car. My favorite aspect of this car is the driver’s layout along with seating position and comfort. Nowadays most cars are moving toward touch screen everything… which can be a frustrating experience in real world driving and not very safe IMO. Maxima provides 4 ways to control the electronics… touch screen, buttons, steering wheel buttons and a rotating button by the gear shifter. Although it is not AWD, the FWD drive provides plenty of traction in everyday driving and almost no torque steer unless under hard acceleration. Other cars in its class lack the driver’s layout and comfort, are slower and more expensive. No worries here as Maxima will not disappoint. Don’t be over sold by brand names. Do your homework and you will find that Maxima is an excellent value.",5

337, on 08/31/16 20:23 PM (PDT),Gene ,2016 Nissan Maxima  3.5 S 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Maximize with Maxima," I purchased a 2016 Maxima one month ago and have driven it 3000 miles.   I previously owned  2000, 2006, and 2011 Maximas, so obviously I am partial to them, primarily because they have excellent styling, good value, and you don't see yourself every third car coming down the road.  My previous experiences have been mostly positive, so that has kept me coming back.    First what I like about this car:  It has great styling, very cool wheels, a classy interior, and loads of power.  I don't know how they did it, but this car has ten more hp than my '11 Max, but gets nearly five miles per gallon better gas mileage.  The car drives nicely, corners great, sounds throaty, and has less wind noise than my '11.   I love some of the color combinations, and the whole effect is very classy.  In fact, I prefer the styling to several of the much more expensive luxury brands.   Now what could be better:  the seats are ok for comfort, but the ones in my '11 were much preferable.  The trunk is way too small for a car of this price.  While wind noise is reduced, I find that Nissan could work on a quieter cabin from road noise.  The placement of the accelerator requires you to turn your foot to the side, and the room for your feet is smaller than I like.  Interior storage is minimal and could be better.   But, I give the car at least a four out of five overall.",4

339, on 07/31/16 13:32 PM (PDT),Frances Glavan ,2016 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),My Love Affair With the Maxima," In 2004, I bought my first Maxima.  When I began looking I was sure I was going to buy a Honda, but since I had been driving company cars for years, I thought ""I'm going to test drive everything and be sure I get the most for my money"".  I drove the Honda Accord, the Toyota Camry and Avalon,  the Lexus, Accura. Mercedes and the Infinite.  When I got behind the wheel of the Maxima, I said to the salesman, this car looks so familiar.  It didn't take long to figure out the interior was almost identical to the Infinite. The Maxima and the Accord were almost even in price, but I got so much more with the Maxima.  A Bose sound system, heated steering wheel, CD and cassette player (it was 2004), etc. Honda just couldn't compare.  In 2013, I bought my second Maxima.  I drove the Acura and the Genesis and hands down the Maxima won for value in the same price range.  In 2016, I didn't bother to drive anything else, and decided I would buy the top of the line Platinum. The car is beautiful inside and out. It has a plush leather seats, Bose sound system, heated and cooled seats, a sunroof and a moon roof. etc. I've had people stop me in parking lots as I was getting out of the car, to tell me how beautiful the car is.  She rides silently and smoothly. The 2004 has 160,000 miles on it and is still running like a dream.  We've done regular maintenance, but she has her original engine and transmission.

When I first saw the Maxima I was taken to the new exterior immediately.  I went to a dealership and test drove the car.  The interior is impressive. The quality of materials used is in line with other Luxury car manufacturers, the zero gravity seats are not as comfortable as I am used to but offer adequate adjustments. The easy entry feature for me is a must. I was surprised to find the Maxima had it. The layout of the dash, including the main display, push button start and the Nissan informant System is in line with my Porsche. The 7 inch display between the instrument cluster limits my need to take my eyes off the road to see my GPS and other important information, again like my Porsche. The quietness of the interior is amazing. The acceleration,and handling of the car exceeded my expectations. The Maxima is not a sports car as Nissan is promoting, but it is a true Luxury car.  Put a Premium name plate on the Maxima and you would easily pay $15,000.00 + more.  This is the best investment in a Luxury car I have ever made, and one of the best values on the market",5

If you don't necessarily want a convertible, the SL has the double panoramic sunroof!   It really is the 4 door sports car they say it is!  Love it!  I did have to learn to duck my head a little to get in (I'm tall & wear heels!), and it does not get the great gas mileage as my Altima but it's not a deal breaker because it's still good. (Believe me, I don't buy gas guzzlers no matter how much I like the car!)  Try it out!",5

346, on 07/05/16 13:21 PM (PDT),Gayle C. ,2016 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),"Performance is fine, Lots of Little hiccups add up"," Decided on a lease for the first time ever. 2016 Platinum Maximum. Beautiful car. Really good power after the paltry Honda Fit that made me feel like I was going to get run over when entering a highway. Thought I would love it. The young woman who took us through the operation manual seemed to do a fine job and we were really happy with having chosen it over the Avalon. First thing we noticed was that the two USB ports that were a *huge* bonus to have so we could charge two phones at once DON'T WORK. Apparently, Nissan only engineered them to charge Apple products, so we're SOL with our Nexus 6 phones. They, apparently, didn't know this because they changed out the whole brain only to discover they still didn't work. That's when they told us they are for iPhones. Who the aitch engineers a car so that only a small segment of buyers can charge their phones? There *is* the cigarette lighter dock inside the console for one phone. Back to charging only one phone. Except. My husband, an electrical engineer, figured out how to make one of the two USB ports work (the other appears to be dead), so we can use the cigarette lighter dock and one USB. And, no, we won't be telling them how he figured it out and, no, it did not involve any rewiring or any physical changes in the car. Furious about this. The Driver's seat settings only adjust periodically and never work if we change drivers using the same key. Push #2 after #1 was driving and nothing happens. Seat stays at #1 setting. Sonar seems to be off now and I cannot find a single mention of sonar, back up camera, or any number of other guesses I made when studying the Owner's Manual or the Navigation manual. Additionally, I test drove the car, so did not ride in the passenger seat. I'm 5'4"" and it feels as if I'm sitting in a hole. I had no idea that the passenger seat did not adjust up and down. Took it for granted that a car of that price would have both seats adjustable. Boy, was I wrong. There is no way in the world that I will ever buy another Nissan no matter how nice this one appears to be. But it was a learning experience, I'll say that.",3

350, on 06/19/16 11:58 AM (PDT),Val ,2016 Nissan Maxima  3.5 SR 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),"Had 5 Maximas, but probably no more"," I drove the SR several times.  While it is the best Maxima yet in many respects with somewhat questionable styling, marketing decisions that Nissan made will drive some buyers away.  I'm currently driving 7th generation SV with Sports and Tech and I still like the car.  I was very excited when the 8th generation came out.  But Nissan's decision to keep basic features from the SR, specifically the moon roof and memory seats/mirrors, something I had in my 2009 Maxima, is troubling.  So, after driving the car and liking its road feel, I came to the conclusion that I don't have to loose the features that I like and there are other manufacturers out there that actually attempt to listen to what their customers desire.  I guess it is time to consider Acura TLX or even Camaro SS or Mustang GT.  Good bye Maxima :(",4
351, on 06/17/16 22:15 PM (PDT),Mike ,2016 Nissan Maxima  3.5 SR 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),most pleasant car so far driven," Currently leasing 2016 Maxima SR. So far the most enjoyable car I've driven (as a field engineer travel 40 weeks per year, renting all type of cars). I'll start with Cons first : poor fuel economy in manual mode (7 - 12 mpg in suburb with many stop signs, not using sport mode), average ticket for fueling went from 32 bucks on sentra to 55 bucks on maxima (it uses 91 gas). hard to get out of a car (seating is very low, need to pay attention not to headbump the roof) comparing to altima, sentra, murano as well as challenger, comaro and mustang. Only 370z was even harder to get out. Also nissan connect does poor tracking of traffic, car keeps telling you'll be in place in 20 minutes for 1 hour.  That's all i have for cons. Pros : press 1 button to start cruise control, press second button to adjust desirable distance between car in front of you and set maximum speed. Now kick back, relax, lazysteer it for 50 miles of trip. (wish to test on longer distance, i had rental maxima for that without dpcc) Not usable in traffic jams since it disengages once you stop. increases mpg from 7 to 28 combined as well. You want to switch the lanes - show signal - it accelerates just the right amount not to cut buddy behind you on the road. You can place hands on 4.5 - 7.5 oclock , rest them on handrests and car will never wiggle / strafe / whatever even in wind (sentra was swinging like hell), place them 2 - 10 oclock and you have perfect sharp control for maneuvers. D shaped steering wheel provides extra grip for those u-turns you often make in california. I can compare this car to S trim 2016 maximas I had for half a year and can feel traction enhancers really work, far less body roll, higher cornering speeds, no understeer / torquesteer. Acceleration and CVT : 4 seconds of fun and ticket. It can make it, you cant afford to make it. Switching to an empty lane on a highway is now no problem. Paddle shifters can be engaged even in Drive mode to give extra acceleration, after you are done - switch gears D - Ds - D and relax again. blind spot sensor a bit paranoic, beeps even when you can see car in it, but never kept silent when bikes / cars were there, pretty reliable. Of course if you use turn signals. Front collision warning - you feel cars are going to stop, maxima makes beep sound, cars indeed start stoping. Remote launch. pros - it just works. return to a cool car in summer and warm in winter. cons - you always forget to push the start button once inside, start moving the stick - car shuts down (so breaking the window and stealing car while you are away will not happen) , but still pretty annoying. Front seats can be indeed cooled during those hot days, but make tickle feeling on your back. If your passanger used cooling and today you drive alone - you'll spend 10 minutes figuring out where that hissing comes from (captain obvious - from the passanger seat, but feels like not closed window). Last but not the least - seat belt stops stretching and fixes its position once you start maneuvering heavily (not necessarily breaking) , keeps you away from swinging inside car (I've seen it only on dodge challenger so far) . Now what makes a difference - big, no, HUGE and tactile buttons both on the steering wheel and on console, matte finish not leaving fingerprints, you always know you have pressed the button. For me that counts. No idea what else to add. Summary - not an economy car , get ready to spend buck for gas and for car itself, not a true sports car - front wheel drive feels worse than awd on subaru, except that - fun and pleasant to drive, sexy and comfortable, obedient and nimble, and don't listen to those saying cvt is not sporty - it is, just prepare to fix it once warranty ends.",5

358, on 05/19/16 10:09 AM (PDT),Al Seider ,2016 Nissan Maxima  3.5 SV 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Beauty And The Beast," The new Maxima really is the Beauty and the Beast! It is extremely attractive, both inside and out and is very well constructed of quality materials. People stare at this car and frequently compliment me on it. The beast part is the revised engine. Put this thing into Sport Mode and it blasts up to high speeds in what seems like nanoseconds. It blows away my 2012 Maxima as far as acceleration goes. The new CVT is deserving of the highest praise possible. This is a CVT that absolutely does not behave like one. It provides immediate responses, is super smooth and feels just like a regular automatic transmission. It feels very ""connected"" to the drivetrain. There is no perception of slippage or hesitation - this thing just moves! I'd far rather have this excellent CVT than some of clunky 8 or 9 speed transmissions I have driven that are constantly changing and can't quite decide which gear to select. I challenge anyone who drives this to honestly admit that this is one of the best transmissions they have ever driven behind.The interior quality rivals that of much more expensive cars. It truly has one of the nicest interiors at any price. I could rave on and on about it. Nissan has certainly set a new standard in ergonomics, interior detailing and the quality of materials. As expected with Maximas, it rides, steers, handles and brakes very well. Pay no attention to the purists who condemn it for being a front wheel drive with a CVT. This is an exceptionally well engineered vehicle. I have reached 29mpg on the freeway which is incredible for an engine of this size, and I like to AWAKEN the beast under the hood. The only criticisms I have is that the audio system on the SV is not up to the standard I expected. I would have probably opted for the SL if had realized how mediocre the sound system is in the SV. Also, the Continental tires are very noisy and don't provide for a particularly smooth ride. It is impossible to use the sound system or have a normal conversation at freeway speeds because of the tire noise. Why Nissan manufacture a superlative, best-in-class vehicle like the Maxima and then condemn it to a set of inferior tires is beyond me. Nissan, PLEASE do something about this. I will be replacing these rolling pieces of garbage with Michelins or Yokohamas which I've had on my previous Maximas. Unfortunately a pricey upgrade for a vehicle so new, but I can't live with the constant tire noise.",5

360, on 04/25/16 11:14 AM (PDT),Kevin L ,2016 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Great premium level sporty family sedan," If you're looking for a premium family sedan with cabin space that can fit 5 people comfortably, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a premium family sedan with performance, sporty feel, AND fits 4 people comfortably, this is THE CAR!Materials used and the technologies included with the Platinum trim in this car are top-notch with this price tag.  When you sit inside the car, it really feels more like a sports car than a traditional sedan because of the interior design, this is probably why Nissan wants to label it as a 4DSC (4 doors sports car). Handling is great for a car that's between mid-full size. Acceleration is plenty with 300HP and 261lb-ft torque. Some people complain about the CVT installed in this car, however those are also enthusiasts who should be driving sticks instead of auto if they really want that ""feel"" of the engine. IMO, CVT in this car is not bad at all and I'd say 95% of the population won't even notice the difference if they weren't told about the CVT. With the CVT, my best fuel economy so far is 34mpg highway and averaging 24mpg in city. Safety features that come with this car and especially in Platinum trim are great to have. My car insurance went down 40% switching from a 2011 Camry to this car. Insurance agent told me that's probably because of the safety features and safety ratings from the new Maxima. If you're considering this car, I'd suggest watching some review and comparison videos on Youtube.Update***After one year of ownership, I am still very impressed with this car. Remote start with heated seats and heated wheel during freezing winter has made my morning commute super warm and enjoyable.  We also just had a baby and the rear cabin has plenty of space for a car seat, which was one of the reasons why I bought the car. Even today, I am still getting lots of compliments about the look of this car from random people in public parking lots. This has definitely been the best car purchase I've made so far.",5

362, on 03/23/16 17:10 PM (PDT),James Craven ,2016 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),So glad I waited for the 2016," Over the years, I have purchased Maximas in 2007 and 2011. I had been waiting for the 2016 Maxima for a while and when the car began appearing on local Nissan lots, I was immediately contacted by the dealerships since I had been bothering them wanting to know when the 2016's would arrive. When I first test drove the one Maxima they had on the lot, I was not impressed. It might have had something to do with the fact that they would not let me take it out on the road. Anyway, I left to return when they had more of a selection to choose from. I was able to test drive an SL and was blown away by the acceleration, handling and style. I was able to take it on mountain roads as well as the interstate. I could not have been happier. I was all set to purchase the SL but saw the Platinum version and that was all I needed. Took the Platinum home 2 hours later. I have had this car since July 4, 2015 and couldn't be more satisfied. This is a great car. I have actually had people stop me in parking lots wanting to see the interior and talk about the car. Do yourself a huge favor and get this car. It is really fun to drive and it will definitely turn heads.Update: I have now owned this car for a year. I still have people stop and admire the car at restaurants, malls, car washes, where ever I am. It is still a pleasure to drive and I could not be happier with the purchase. The handling is superb and the acceleration is kind of invigorating. You will have fun driving this car.",5

Just passed 1800 miles and it's a pleasure to drive. The suspension is a little stiff due to it being a sport but that's something I knew going in. Has all of the bells and whistles of many vehicles above its class. With the dial comfortably located I rarely touch the screen. Power is very sufficient and road noise is virtually nonexistent. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for a sub 40k 4 door sedan that likes a little wow factor. Have been complimented many times so far. As far as the cons.....the camel leather wrapped steering wheel looks great but I can already tell it's going to take a lot of care to keep looking clean and new. We tend to drive with our hands in the same location and I don't know how well it's going to hold up over the years. The Bluetooth has acted up a few times when trying to connect my fiance's Galaxy s6 but my iPhone 6 works perfect. No moonroof available on the SR I guess due to the center of gravity, but I feel like something could have been done to make it an option. Mpg is good on the highway but I have been averaging less than 20 in the city. (Premium fuel only). Other than that I absolutely love this car!",5

I have always owned Maxima's. There are two things that I am disappointed in with the cost of this car. The passenger front seat should be able to move all ways just as the driver's seat (it only goes back & forth not up and down. so its sits very low) & the back seat is not spacious at all. The look of the car is very sporty. Because I wanted the panoramic roof and the LED headlights I had to get the Platinum since the other styles only offer one or the other. Overall a great car..,4

Styling, comfort, tech...it has it all.  Would not really call it a sports car as there is body lean and it is a big car..But it can really go and if your really buying a sports car are you buying a 4 door...maybe the Porsche for 90K. As far as the CVT, unless your a total car enthusiast you will never know the difference...until you check your gas mileage.  My first highway trip of 240 miles I got 33.7MPG.  For a car this size...wow.  Seats are very comfortable....my only complaint about the car...the passenger seat should have 8 way adjustments...for a car that cost 42k?  The controls are easy to read and easy to navigate, the stereo is miles better than the old Maxima, safety additions...blind spot monitor, predictive braking and parking sonar are all a big plus.  The fit and finish are really nice, way better than previous version.  The ride (while not a Mercedes S550) is extremely quiet and comfortable.  The  quilted seats, hand stitched dashboard, diamond patterned wood trim, panoramic roof, heated and cooled seats, flat bottom Heated steering wheel; this all comes together in a car that is 1000's less than you could spend somewhere else.  Obviously beauty is in the eye of the beholder...but this car looks great and drives even better.  It is not the perfect car, but Nissan deals and you won't find more bang for your buck anywhere.  Unless you need to pull up with a nameplate to impress people, this car does it all without the big price....Do yourself a favor and if your looking for a FUN SEDAN...at least test drive the new Maxima, you will not be sorry!!!",5
374, on 02/06/16 09:28 AM (PST),Jeff ,2016 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Never Considered Nissan... Until Now," Week 2 of owning my 2016 Maxima Platinum and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  I'm 30 years old, no children, young(ish) professional with a long commute (30 miles one way).  I originally started shopping the '16 Cadillac CTS, Jaguar XF, and Lincoln MKZ.  I happened to see a Maxima on the road and it really stood out, so I read some online reviews and made my way to the dealership ""just to look"".  Well, after driving the cars priced thousands more, I was seriously impressed with this car.  I'll go through what's meaningful to me.  Safety - what are grouped into ""packages"" on other vehicles with already high base prices are all standard on the Maxima Platinum and commuting in Chicago through dense traffic on busy expressways I find the extra set of watchful eyes on the road very reassuring.  The blind spot monitor, front and rear sonar, forward emergency braking, smart cruise control, driver attention alert, around view monitor - these have all come in handy already in just these two short weeks and I'll probably not buy another car without this helpful tech.  Interior - this is MILES beyond anything in the mainstream segment and rivals cars in classes above.  The diamond quilted seats, hand stitched dashboard, diamond patterned wood trim, panoramic roof, heated and cooled seats, flat bottom sport steering wheel; all these features combine to make each driving experience feel special.  The nav and infotainment system is awesome - the redundant controls with the i-drive like rotary wheel is convenient if you don't want to poke at a touchscreen and the navigation information can be swiped into the driver control cluster so you can keep your eyes on the road.  Driving Experience - anyone who says CVT and sport sedan can't go together (and I was one of those individuals) haven't actually driven this car.  The power is IMMEDIATE and instant on-demand.  The system can keep the RPMs low in everyday driving to maximize fuel economy but push the sport mode button and things get moving fast.  The ability of the CVT to give you that power instantaneously and then hold you in the power band is incredible and for merging onto highways at speed, it makes things a breeze.  I never feel wanting for power even after driving the twin-turbo CTS which has 400+hp.  Will this car cannibalize sales from the Infiniti Q50?  Probably.  Will it steal sales from cars in classes above?  It just did for me.  It's large and spacious, sporty without being pretentious and immature, elegantly appointed on the inside, and cheaper to insure.  If you're looking for a full featured near-luxury (or luxury in my opinion) car with sporting aspirations that's not too fussy to be a good reliable daily driver, head down to your Nissan dealership. I drove one home that night and have been thrilled every time I drive it.Update 8/9: After owning this car for a little over 7 months my initial impressions have not changed.  I currently have a little over 7K miles and there are some noteworthy things I'd like to add.  After a month or so of driving, I noticed that when in sport mode, the acceleration DRAMATICALLY improved (not that I had any concerns about it to begin with).  I did some research, and found that some auto manufacturers add software that puts limitations on the engine during the break-in period.  Not sure if this is something that Nissan does, but the throttle responsiveness and power from the engine abruptly improved a noticeable amount.  The only time I have noticed the CVT is when in Sport mode during spirited driving, the transmission holds the revs as if anticipating another heavy throttle input.  This results in some minor droning from the transmission, however this is never observed in everyday driving in Normal mode.  Still amazed by the ability of the CVT to give you instantaneous power; merging and passing is easy and never requires planning.  The forward emergency braking can be somewhat overzealous - when a car is slowing down to make a turn ahead of you and you keep going at speed anticipating it moving out of your way, I've had the car brake itself somewhat abruptly several times.  It certainly is better than having an accident, however it can be obtrusive.  When you hear the warning beeps, a gentle braking motion can prevent this (which I should probably have been doing anyway).  Minor note - not a big deal, but I found a way to turn off the honks and beeps the car emits when you lock and unlock it.  Kind of a nice feature, especially getting home late in a suburban area and not wanting to annoy the neighbors.  Overall structural rigidity is impressive - no squeaks or rattles, no issues with the pano roof that other reviewers have mentioned (which are all covered under warranty anyway).  Some minor recalls have been addressed, but so far zero issues and still one of the best vehicles I have ever owned.",5
375, on 01/23/16 07:58 AM (PST),Doyle ,2016 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),First Nissan," I traded a Chevy Tahoe in for my Maxima Platinum. This is the first car I have owned since high school (I am 68). I am very impressed with this car. Believe me I did a lot of research and drove several vehicles before buying this car. I actually went to the dealer to look at a smaller suv, when I saw the Maxima I was really impressed with the body style and all the features on the Maxima Platinum. One of my main concerns was road noise, I told the salesman that if the car had road noise I was not interested. After driving, I was completely sold on this car. For the price, you will not find a classier sedan.",5
376, on 01/14/16 09:58 AM (PST),Joe Dvorsky ,2016 Nissan Maxima  3.5 SL 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),My Maxima is the MAX.," The Maxima is a great car. I only have 660 miles on my Maxima SL, and already love it. It is a great value considering the equipment included. The SL is so well equipped, that there are no option packages. Everything that is optional are individual items. The fit and finish is something you would expect to see in a Lexus, Acura, Cadillac, etc. If I were to say anything negative, I would say the Maxima never quite lived up to the 4DSC label, and the new 2016 is no exception. Despite this, the car is fast (well composed at high speeds), handles very well, and is a great driving experience. I have had my Maxima on two road trips, and hoped neither would come to an end.",5

After doing some serious research the 328xi base model didn't match up to the 2016 Maxima SR. After adding all the bells and whistles I wanted to the 328xi the price tag went from sub 40k to mid 50k. The 2016 Maxima SR was my choice. All those bells and whistles I wanted came standard for a price tag of sub 40k. Navigation, premium sound system, back up camera, sonar sensors, heated seats, heated steering wheel, really cool 19"" wheels oh don't forget the 300 horses that make those 19s look even better on the road. That's just to name a few. I'm super excited I decide to go with the Maxima it has everything I wanted plus a few extras. If your looking for more BANG for your BUCK consider the Maxima. Cuddos to Nissan on a job well done!!!",5

The 2016 Maxima Platinum is hands down the best value in terms of design, quality and performance.

Was considering a BMW or Audi, but fell in love with the Platinum.  Sporty yet comfortable. Great handling, quiet, and fast!  Look forward to driving it everyday.  Great gas mileage: 21 city, 34 hwy.  You know you have a nice car when you catch strangers taking pictures of it in the parking lot!  You did it right Nissan.  I do rely on my cell phone for navigation as the navigation systems doesn't always appear to be up-to-date.",5
382, on 11/11/15 09:37 AM (PST),David ,2016 Nissan Maxima  3.5 S 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),The Did It Right," I have had the car for a month now.  To sum into 2 categories:Simply Incredible:1. The interior.  Our other car is an Audi.  This is just as nice, if not better.2. Safety features.  What can I say...WOW.  They nailed this.  The car has beeped at me 3 times now when the car in front of the car in front of me has hit their brakes hard.  Once the car in front of me literally had to fully lock up to avoid an accident.  Me?  A little hard braking but no big deal...becuase the car warned me.  They found that perfect sweet spot where the beeping is not annoying, but it always does it at just the right time. 3. Surround cameras...so easy to park!4. The CVT. Just never think about it.  I guess that means it is good!5. Remote start.  It was cold yesterday, finally.  Remote started.  When I got in the car I noticed it heated up the steering wheel for me, in addition to of course heating the cabin to the temp I left the car at.  Really nice touch.6. The headlights.  Brightest and most precise I have ever seen in a car.  Visibility is just great.Good but needs work1. Nav and entertainment.  Mostly nailed it.  Little things I wish were better.  You cannot see the song playing in the 7"" screen for sat radio (does so with iPod and bluetooth)...takes a bit to find some things in the menu system.  Blacks out options when driving for saftey which is fine but some I disagree shoudl be blacked out.  Most useful 3d map I have seen in a car.  Really Nissan, get with the program and allow Car Play and such...I do worry that this system will be ""old"" in 5 years, hope they have an ability and plan for software updates!  The Nissan Apps are useless, but frankly I don't want Trip Advisor in my car.  Would DIE to get a Spotify app though!2. Intelligent cruise.  Its pretty damn cool.  I suppose I should not expect this to work like I assume a Tesla works!  Only complain is when a car in front of me changes lanes it takes a while for the car the ""let it go"" and realize I have clear roads in front of me.  Overall I love it though.3. Zero G seats.  OK it took a full 3 weeks to find an acceptable position (I am 6' 2"" with a bad back).  Agreed, the center console can annoy the knee, I have to really set the seat back a little more than I like to so it does not happen.  I worry that in a few years there will be a noticable wear spot there.  At least it has some padding.  Otherwise seats are really the best I have ever had in a car...ventilation works great, leg support extender great for someone my size.  And as other reviews have noted, why was Nissan unwilling to make the passenger seat 6 or 8 way?  Short people complain that they are really low, and really tall people JUST have enough head space.  What else can I say?  I feel like I don't deserve this car, the interior is so damn nice!  Drives with that perfect balance of a really stiff frame, but forgiving at the same time.  Issues I have with this car are pretty trivial.  Everyone who has been in it or driven it is jsut floored...especially people who own luxury brands!",5
383, on 09/14/18 21:31 PM (PDT),LEO ,2018 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Undercover Luxury Vehicle," I owned an infiniti G37 before falling in love with my blue platinum Maxima. I was looking to trade in for a Q50 but the luxurious and well appointed interior, the exciting exterior design and the almost uniqueness of the model (there are not too many out there) made me purchase a great vehicle for almost $15K less than a similarly equipped Infiniti. The Mileage is great, also the premium gas is recommended, not required as in Luxury brands. The only downfall is the service experience. You will not get the same level of service as on a luxury brand but so far I had not any issues requiring service visits , just the first regular maintenance which you can perform anywhere. SO far after 8 months it is the best vehicle I have ever owned. I would recommend it",5

385, on 06/24/18 18:55 PM (PDT),Ravi Rozier ,2018 Nissan Maxima  Platinum 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Smiling Sun Day's," Every day the sun shines and I walk out to my parked vehicle, I can't help but smile. I'm still in the honeymoon phase where I just adore the sight of my car right before I prepare myself to sit inside and drive to work. I must confess, I smile if it's a rainy day, foggy day, whatever day it is, I smile. Still, the way the sun shines off my 2018 Carnelian red Nissan Maxima Platinum edition is extraordinary. I know I picked the right color. I just purchased the car last month and I had to make a quick decision. I had a gut feeling that if I didn't get off my couch that Sunday afternoon, I would have missed out on the exact color I wanted. I've recently checked and there are only 3 red Platinum editions within 100 miles of here. I bought the car at a dealer 2 miles away from my house so I'm still happy about that. As far as getting in the car, I've read that the Platinum is like a entry level luxury car. That's good enough for me and this car is an upgrade over my 2011 Maxima. The seats are pretty nice. The computer is awesome and it integrates with my Samsung Galaxy with Android Auto. I love it because my old Maxima didn't have the capability to stream music. I'm still geeked up by the fact I can stream all of the latest albums without any issues. There are two USB ports right in the front, so now when I pick up a friend, they don't have to unplug my phone to charge their phone. We can both get to the restaurant with 100% battery power.  Also, the obvious prize is no longer having to buy car chargers when the one your using inevitably stops working. Also, the all-around camera is pretty cool. I like it a lot, especially when I realized that most of the Maxima trims don't have it. It helps with parking and now I'm always in the lines in the supermarket parking lot. The other thing that I absolutely love about this Platinum are the LED headlights. In my last Maxima, I thought age was finally catching up to me. I couldn't see too good at night and frequently turned on the bright lights when I was alone on some local streets. The first night I drove the Platinum and those LED automatically came on, it was OMG! In fact, I'm not aging at an accelerated rate, it's just the headlights on my old SV were absolutely horrible. Well, they did work so maybe I'm going a little too hard with the criticism, but the difference is astounding. I love those LED lights and every car I purchase in the future will have to have them. Like I said, I'm still in the honeymoon phase and the car is still pristine. Only had it for a month. Maybe in 6 months I'll be so-so about the car. But as of now, every time I go outside and get ready to go work, I smile as bright as any sun can shine it's glorious rays on my 2018 Carnelian red Maxima Platinum edition.",5

391, on 02/14/18 08:53 AM (PST),Merideth Fuchs ,2017 Nissan Juke  SL 4dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl Turbo CVT),"Great car, bad name"," I bought this 2015 Nissan Juke SL as a replacement for my 2012 JUKE SL that was totaled in an accident (not of my making) on 2/15/2017.  It has taken this long to find the close replacement car, and even though it doesn't have awd, as my 2012 JUKE SL did, in NC it is not as necessary as it was in CO at 8600 ft elevation.  I think Nissan has made a big mistake in discontinuing this model car and that they just did a poor job of marketing it plus having named it badly.  This car is so much fun to drive and has good acceleration with the turbo along with fantastic fuel economy.  I always considered it to be ""my porche 911"" wanna be (poor girl's porche) and it never disappointed.  I drove it from mountains of CO to mountains (albeit smaller mountains) of NC (~ 1500 miles) with my adult son, my Newfi (110lbs) and my terrier mix rescue plus car full of literal baggage) very comfortably.  I love, love, love this car and have owned many cars, including BMW, AUDI, GMC, FORD (trucks and Mustang), FIAT (spider and sedan a million years ago, when it was Fiat), but none are as much fun and as economical to drive as my turbo Juke SL.  They really needed to have called it something else - works for me because my last name is FUCHS, so it was Fuchs' JUKE or the FUCHS JUKE.  But really, for the population at large, it was the wrong name for a car model.",5

I really loved the shape and turbo performance of the vehicle, so I bought it and put thousands of saved money towards the purchase.  Once the car hit 34,000 miles, the transmission went and had to be replaced.  The dealership basically indicated that I was being overly concerned since ""it's covered under warranty"".  Firstly, I like to travel and don't appreciate getting stuck with a broken down car with no working transmission.  Secondly, it is great that it's covered under warrantly; however, when I purchase a vehicle, I plan on having it past the 100,000 mile warranty.  I've purchased many vehicles in my lifetime and drove them far beyond 100,000 miles.

We alerted the dealer and they are going to take a look. We suspect possibly bad gas from sitting on the lot for so long, but unsure until they check it out. Crossing our fingers that this car will be as fun and worry free as our first Juke, once we get this initial hiccup straightened out.Well, it's a year later, and the 2016 Juke doesn't run a swell as the 2012 Juke, but it is still a petty good car.

398, on 04/03/17 10:50 AM (PDT),Debbie B. ,2016 Nissan Juke  SL 4dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl Turbo CVT),More compliments than on my Caddy," I love the spunk of this car! And especially the custom colorization. Since I was purchasing the car, I purchased all of the color accents that I could. The car is a beautiful dark blue, with red accents. I get compliments on the car daily. Everyone loves the look of it and especially the color accents. I previously has a Cadillac ATS and before that a Caddy CTS. Obviously both of the Caddys road smoother. But frankly, I got tired of the exorbitant repair and maintenance bills on cars that were only a few years old. Also, there was so much technology on the Caddy's that it was constantly in the shop. One even a needed a new transmission when it was just 4 years old. So I was looking to downsize, have a car with less electronics, better mileage and just a simpler ride. The Juke is all of that and more! I can't say enough about how happy I am. I purchased it in June of 2016 and it really does get 30 mpg. And I have had no problems in the year and a half I've owned it verses the probably 8 times the Cadillac was in for service during the first year. Often, the service visits were recalls or simple technological glitches, but frankly I don't think a new car should be in the shop at all in its first few years. And that's the case with my Juke. Yes, the back seat is small, but it is typically just me and my husband and my mom and I fit in the back just fine. Yes, the trunk space is smaller than my previous car, but the seats lie down easily, so it's actually better then than before. Love, love, love it! Thank you Nissan for a solid, sporty car that spends more time on the road and less time in the shop.",4
399, on 12/08/16 14:07 PM (PST),Jeremy C ,2016 Nissan Juke  S 4dr Hatchback AWD (1.6L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Amazing for the price!," I LOVE MY JUKE!!!  I realize this car won't be for everyone so let's get the obvious negatives out of the way first;  Cargo space is limited (but there is a split folding for extra room).  The back seat is not for adults especially on longer journeys (headroom as well as leg room will be tight).  There is a blind spot that requires more attention when you are changing lanes.  The ride is a little stiff and road noise can be annoying at times.  Now let's get to the good stuff!  This car is sporty, really sporty.  The 4 cylinder turbo charged engine will do 0-60 in 7 secs, this would rival some 2 door coupes.  The CVT is responsive and I have no trouble accelerating when I want to, and there is an option to shift up or down via the center gear lever (if you want/need to have that control).  The steering is right on point and super responsive, and you can ""feel the road"" in the steering wheel.  I live in Colorado and the Juke is a blast in the snow!  It has 7 inches of clearance so you won't have to worry about ""plowing"" through deep snow with your front end and the AWD works like a champ.  The AWD does everything I could ask it to and you can switch it to FWD only if you want to save on gas mileage.  Speaking of gas mileage, I average 34 MPG in this thing, and I live in the city.  The bluetooth as well as the voice command system work well and calls through the speaker system come in clear.  Bottomline:  I have two young kids and came from a coupe.  Having 4 doors as great and they will not outgrow the back seats for at least 6 or 7 years from now.  I don't need a lot of cargo space (we have my wife's vehicle for that).  For me this car is a perfect combination of what I want.  It is fun, great on gas, amazing in the snow, and reliable (10yr/100,000 mile bumper to bumper and lifetime powertrain warranties).  If you are looking for a vehicle to commute in that looks fantastic, you will not find ANYTHING else that is this good for the price you pay!",4

The Juke was quirkey in looks and I liked that.  But upon driving it, the handling was sloppy and the headroom was terrible for my boyfriend as a passenger and anyone sitting in the back seat.

Love everything about this car, but Nissan used cheap paint on this car.  You won’t notice on the plastic pieces such as the bumper but the hood, and front fenders have a paint chipping problem.  I use the adaptive cruise and always stay as far away from the car in front of me as possible but this is a terrible paint job.  For instance, after putting less than 5,000 miles on this car, the hood looks worse than my old  Chrysler 200 with 140,000 Miles.  I absolutely love everything else about this vehicle besides that.  I can’t stress enough how much of a problem the paint job is though.  I have no other option but to have the dealer install a clear bra, and my only advice to anyone looking to purchase a Murano is to do the Same.  You will want to cover at minimum the first 12-15 inches of the hood, or you will regret it.

I paid $395 extra for Nissan special color (white) by the way.   Seems to me the paint finished at the factory when car body was painted.I submitted claim to Nissan Consumer Affair office. They denied the claim to replace the vehicle and told me to go to the dealer to repaint the back door. I told them that car is too expansive and I refuse to repaint it because the dealer body shop quality won't be the same as the factory. Nissan consumer affair office suggested to open a claim with BBB and that's exactly what I did.All I am trying to address is the Quality Control issue at the factory. I want the QC managers at Nissan to see what they are missing.  My previous 2009 Murano had no issues for 10 years.  2009 Murano was made in Japan.I am very disappointed. I purchased 4 Nissans and I think this Nissan Murano will be my last Nissan going forward. Also, please take a look, the lenses on new Murano have some kind of finger prints or tape glue marks. I did show this to the service manager. He was really surprised. We went outside to see if other muranos have this issue and YES, all of them had it.Bumper on my brand new Murano was not attached to the body. I also noticed that after 1 week of having my car.

I love the interior and exterior styling of my Platinum model red/cashmere interior vehicle! Having had a major back issue at 42 I became aware of the importance of comfort. I also love to drive. This car is so comfortable, especially the Driver’s seat. I too wish the passenger seat though it is very comfortable as well,  you can’t tweak it for your body beyond the usual electric controls. Both seats heat or cool independently. I thought Phoo - who needs that! I do and all my passengers love it. It’s amazing when the temperature is in the 20’s in NY to have a heating pad on your back or bum. The reverse is true as well. Houston gets very hot so you turn your seat control into Cool and within 10 minutes you feel like you’re sitting on an ice bag. Heat and  passenger has their own controls. Big display screen with 8 cameras. There is only a Ding if you’re about to back off of a cliff but I believe most of us are already in hyper-vigilant mode! Bluetooth works great. I don’t know how, but as long as my phone or my passenger’s phone has Bluetooth on it does the rest itself. Takes a while to learn to use cameras to cover blind spots. I’m having a slow time of it getting used to the added length of front end and bumper length as well. I’ve already got a scrape from a concrete protection post set about 4’ from a gas pump. Oops. The 18” wheels came filled with Nitrogen which helps prevent condensation and tire rot from it. I got up to Malone, NY, and they were like Nitrogen? In your tires? Nobody does that. The first time it got cold this rather large diagram of my car appeared on the dash display. All 4 tires had dropped from 35ppi to 17ppi and were bulging out. My salesman had said Never mix Nitrogen and air. I had to drive almost 2 hours to get to nearest Nitrogen set up, but I called my Houston dealership and the manager said “Who told you that? They can be used together.” Problem solved. By the way my long  drive TX to NY was a smooth ride all the way.I need to wrap this baby up! Gas mileage is not wonderful but isn’t the worst either. The next car I get I will be watching that closely! I could have bought a lower end new Mercedes for what I paid. I looked at that, but it was like comparing sleeping on a great mattress vs a woven mat made from palm fronds. Night and day. I’m sure more expensive Benz’s would have favorably compared but they were out of my range. I love this car!",5

If you back up to an object the system beeps once and if you for some reason don't hear it or don't see it on the screen you will hit the object.  There is no way to increase the loudness of the single beep. Our second biggest complaint was that the car does not ride smoothly and I believe it was the tires that caused that. I asked Razzari Nissan to check the balancing of the tires and whether the tires might be out of round. After they finished with the car, all they did was take it for a test drive  and found that some of the tires were low on air and they did not find any ""flat"" spots on the tires. The tire monitor did not show the tires were low on air. They refused to rebalance the tires and check for the tires to be out of round.

Likewise, the intuitive AWD system handles very well and with power. It is also very balanced and smooth on freeway.

I am happy with the car so far but have only had it a few weeks so ant really rate a lot of the categories. One thing I wish they had done better is the customization of the dash display, you can customize somewhat, but not completely, and some of the things they did seem just odd to me.

Only those that plan on towing something should consider some other car. What is the best about 2017 Murano is the comfort. I just came back from 3000 miles vacation trip and, it is the first one that I can remember, I did not come back with some back pain. Driver's seat is just a bit short of amazing... The mpg that I got on my trip was not as I expected (I got 23.9 overall, and was getting 25 or bit less on highway alone). But I think I should not expect much more since I was driving at high speeds (70 - 80 mph) mostly through hills and mountains... There are two things that I found to be wrong with my car; driver side doors are slightly misaligned, and there is a tiny blemish on the paint of the driver's side back door by the door handle. I picked pearl white, and it looks very good (it cost $400 more), but everything is more visible on it, so the car has to be washed more frequently. Thinking about it now, I would pick some darker color...It is 9/14/2018 today. There is just over 15k miles on my Murano. Two weeks ago I came back from vacation in Colorado/Utah and I made over 3200 miles with average MPG on my way back home of 26.3 (highway). Murano did well in mountains, no complaints for lack of power. But the flies/dirt on white finish were ugly, and after I got back home, I found that it is very hard/time consuming to clean the front of the car. So my biggest regret is still the white color of my Murano. Perhaps, I should mention one other problem that I found; the rear window wiper arm was mounted too low so that the wiper blade was resting on car finish and not on the glass. I corrected this assembly problem myself. Other than this and  what I mentioned before, everything is O. K.",4

I made the mistake and bought an Audi Q5, had it for a year $20K in the hole for trade in, but want to have a body style similar to the 2003, 2010 Murano (my mistake!).  However, the gas mileage with the Q5 was great about 22 mpg/city.  I have have had my 2017.5 Murano for about 3 weeks now and I am getting 14.3 mpg/city THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM.  As soon as I can get to the Toyota dealer I will be trading in this car.  It is a shame, because the interior and comfort of the car is great, but the gas mileage is terrible.  I have taken the car back to the dealer twice to no avail, so my suggest would be NOT to purchase this car if gas mileage is an issue for you.",2

The powerful V6 engine has propelled me out of harms way more than once; I have made numerous trips moving possessions from one home to another and have been really pleased with how much I can fit in; my handicapped mother can easily get in and out of the passenger seat (huge relief!); the convenience of the voice activated commands have proved valuable as I do not have to take my eyes off the road to make/receive calls and change the radio stations. Overall, my opinion has improved and I am thoroughly pleased with this car! Nothing as a drawback.Having owned two Nissan Altimas previously, I was aware of the quality of Nissan cars. My current needs dictated that I step up to a larger vehicle and test drove Nissan Pathfinder, Rogue and Murano.  While all three provided the extra space that was needed, the biggest selling feature on the 2017.5 Murano was the comfort with the styling of the interior and exterior sweetening the decision.  The final deciding factor was the fact that my physically challenged mother was easily able to get in and out of the car because the seats are chair level.  Transferring from a wheelchair or walker is incredibly easy with this car.  It should be noted that I had also test drove popular cars - Toyota Rav 4 and Highlander, Honda CRV and Pilot, Mazda CX5 and CX9 among others (all for at least 24 hours each), my mother and husband both had problems getting in and out of these cars and the design and handling of these vehicles were in a different league than the Murano.  I have my 2017.5 SL AWD Murano for 3 months now and my fondness for this car increases with each ride.  I am impressed with the turning radius, advanced safety features, intuitive placement of all controls, lovely styling of the interior ambient light, sure handling with quick response and sense of security in this car.  My six months of research have paid off!  The only thing that I would suggest to the designers of this car would be to add another light in the rear of the car.  Other than that, it is very evident that a great deal of thought went in to the safety, styling and comfort of the Murano.  I am looking forward to many more years of being satisfied!",5

My new 2017.5 Murano SV assembled in Mississippi drives great, and is quiet, and is very comfortable. It has strong engine performance. The CVT is smooth and in fact the smoothest transmission I have ever encountered. I love this vehicle.....EXCEPT coming direct from the factory in Mississippi to my dealership...it arrived with a defective AC System.  At about 200 miles I returned the Murano to the dealer and said ""I don't think the AC works"". That was a correct assessment, it had no freon in the system. My dealer tested the system and added dye to find the leak. No leak could be found. The system was recharged.  Five days later the AC System was dead again.  I took the Murano to a different Nissan dealer to eliminate possibly poor mechanics. Dealer number two tested the system, added dye to the system, and pressurized the system. No leaks could be found. The system was recharged. Eleven days later on the road in 90 degree weather the AC System totally failed again. I called Nissan customer service and ended up in maybe Malaysia , I could not really understand what she (customer service) was saying. I asked to speak to someone in customer service in the US and was told there was no one. Finally, I told customer service under the my state's Lemon Law I was going to return the car to Nissan. A day later I received a call from Nissan in Tennessee and was assigned a case number. At this point the Murano is going into a Nissan shop again.  Currently. the Nissan Murano has 1000 miles on it. Would I purchase this Murano again now knowing all the AC System problems were going to occur? The answer is NO......UPDATED REVIEW: The Nissan dealer in Edmonds, Washington found the leak, a high pressure metal line with a pin hole leak. The dealer provided a photo of the leaked dye around the hole. Nissan corporate is sending me a $250 debit card for the inconvenience caused. The case is closed but I remain unsure of the vehicle reliability, only time and additional miles will tell the true story. UPDATE: I still like the Murano. The SV model has weak headlights but the higher models have great headlights. Left and right driver visibility at curb level is poor. The Murano is great to drive on the highway. Driver and passenger comfort is outstanding.",3

I like the extra space, and the electronics and technical gadgets are great too.   The Murano is very beautifully designed and rides VERY NICELY.

Let me list the few negatives first:  The parking brake is the foot type.  I'd much prefer an electronic parking brake.  The steering wheel volume buttons are located in an awkward position.  The comfort of the much touted zero gravity seats are way overrated.  They are average at best, with little thigh support.  Now some of the pluses: The acceleration, a CVT that behaves a lot like a 6 speed, dynamic cruise control, smooth, quiet ride, 8"" touch screen, the safety tech such as predictive forward collision warning, rear cross traffic alert, blind spot warning, surround view camera with moving object detection. Now include Apple Car Play, a logical infotainment interface, USB and 12 volt outlets, voice recognition, etc. and you've got a very advanced technology package.

For the price of this vehicle, all of the safety features should have been included, but only the Platinum has all the safety features. The Platinum also includes some nice bells and whistles, but not enough to warrant the extra expense to get the additional safety features. Additional Cons include the Blue Tooth completely failing periodically. I mean it greys out on the menu. In Illinois, I must use Blue Tooth to use my phone. Illinois should be dragging Nissan into court over this. Additional infotainment features flat out don't work (Google Search and Trip Advisor). The good news is that driving the vehicle is a pleasure and I am still happy I purchased it (mainly because I was able to get something besides a black interior)After almost a year, the infotainment still annoys me.Voice recognition in this car really does not work, it only frustrates. The first six months of driving the vehicle the Bluetooth worked intermittently. That was finally fixed. Steering wheel controls are inconvenient and sometimes even annoying. My last vehicle was a Lincoln MKZ and now I am used to everything working. The vehicle itself is great to drive and is very comfortable, but I will look elsewhere when my lease expires.",4

The Murano satisfies all my needs and gives me a lot of extras found on luxury cars. As a matter of fact, it beats luxury cars in styling, roominess, and value.  It's like looking at a piece of art.  It's plenty quiet, accelerates quick and smooth, and contains many safety and convenience features.  You can spend less for a competitor's crossover, but you won't get anything close to the Murano. I got the SL package because you need the all around view camera system to see in tight spots. The SL package also gives you the leather seats.",5

It is like driving on a cloud! The seats are fantastic. I could not believe what I would have to pay BMW or MBZ to get half of what the Murano gives me. The interior rivals the Infiniti QX60 and is without compromise. Loved my Xterra (still do)... it has cargo space for weeks and two of its outlets were live.

450, on 04/29/17 10:22 AM (PDT),Nissan Murano ,2017 Nissan Murano  SV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),2017 Nissan Murano SV Trim," When I was originally looking for SUV I was aiming at 2017 Honda CRV 1.5 Turbo engine. Choosing between compact and mid-size SUVs was easy enough based on overall interior and exterior quality as well as technology package that Nissan offers from most the base model something that is available on CRV top trim level. Have been driving it for almost 3 weeks now and cannot be happier. Never owned SUV ever before, therefore I am still in adaptation mode. Previously I drove Honda Accord and can only say that gas consumption in the city is about the same considering that accord is 4 cyl and Murano is 6 cyl engines. By driving conservatively I am sure I can achieve even better gas mileage. Very quite enjoyable ride. Steering handling is awesome. Infotainment system is much better than on any Honda models.  Front console controls are very intuitive and easy to operate. Just take it for drive test and check it out for yourself.After driving Murano for 6 month I am still pleased with the purchase. Drove it from Upstate NY to NYC and unexpectedly for myself highway miles was 31 mpg that slightly above what sticker says. City driving still can show mixed mpg 15-25 depends on traffic. My Murano didn't see winter in Upstate NY yet, therefore not sure what to expect. At this point I am pleased with this vehicle.Now I own my Murano for a year. Great experience overall. One minor detail that would interest some Murano owners. During past winter we had a couple of weeks with low temperature -20C or -4F. I noticed after leaving car overnight or extensive period of time turned off my trip mileage and log information were reset. To some drivers it's no big deal, but I just wanted to point this out.  This only happened during extreme cold temperature. On the positive note, Murano handles snow PERFECT as well as rides perfectly fine. Gas consumption remain constant from the day I purchased it. CVT transmission definitely contributing to relatively low gas consumption. I also noticed that build in Navigation doesn't work as good as lets say Google Maps or aftermarket Navigation device. Can't really say much about other SUVs but came across review on Honda CRV and seems that Honda has the same problem. Those who rely on Navigation and drive a lot I would suggest to do research and decide based on your driving habits. In conclusion I'd like to say that owning Murano is lots of fun and positive experience. I haven't seen perfect car yet. Every car has something that would raise an eye brow. Take Murano for a test drive and decide for your self.",5

I knew exactly what I wanted, not a lot of extras, the car comes with almost everything I wanted, drove 142 miles to buy it. I drove it home and wasn't miserable. I have been driving a Volvo XC90 and thought it was a comfortable car until I got the Murano... I am still learning how to operate all the newer gadgets, but it is not difficult at all. So far, the only thing I wish I had added is darker tint on the glass. The Apple play is not useful for those of us who don't care for iPhones. I had heard that the 20 inch wheels were not as smooth as 18s, but I would fall asleep if it were any smoother. Even my husband, who is a very tough sell on new ideas, is very impressed. He is 6'3"", weighs about 240 lbs and can drive the car very comfortably. I have not folded the rear seats, not sure I ever will, so I can't comment.

I put over 20,000 miles a year in it and I generally trade it in at the 60K mark. In short, I love this SUV.  I tried to change it up and looked at the BMW, Volvo, Lincoln, Acura and Lexus, each one more expensive, yet, none could compare.  Roomiest back seat in the class.  Great acceleration, even better reliability and for an SUV a smooth comfortable ride.  On the negative side I find the headlights could be brighter and on my first Murano the lights had a 3 way position switch (low, medium, high) you could utilize.  This was a great feature when driving on dark, winding back roads. It negated the need to use your high beams and the accompanying glare that high beams brings. They should bring this back.  I also find the NAV system can be a bit unwieldy and the POI feature is a waste.",5

I ended up purchasing a 2016 Murano Platinum with 9600 miles at a great price and with the full extended warranty. I have been so pleased with the car in the month or so that I've owned it-- I drive all over the state for work, so comfort, reliability, and quiet interior were very important to me, and this car meets all of those expectations. I also needed more cargo space for work, and it fits everything I need to carry with room for even more. The Platinum version has all the bells and whistles, which I wasn't seeking out but enjoy having. The gas mileage is a little less than advertised, but it's better than my previous car, which was smaller.

461, on 03/18/17 04:59 AM (PDT),Melissa ,2016 Nissan Murano  Platinum 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),I wanted to love it... but," My husband and I bough a brand new 2016 Nissan Murano hybrid PLATINUM edition with every single bell and whistle they offered on 1-31-2016. About a week after owning the vehicle I was driving and started to smell a burning smell. Soon after there was a loud electronic warning noise that was constant but there were no warnings anywhere on the screens as to what it might have been. I pulled over and turned the car off and then back on and it didn't return. When I took it in the dealership they tried to recreate the issue for three days but couldn't, so I had to leave without any answers. The next week my husbands commuter car wouldn't turn on so he had to jump start his car. I then had to take it in again because my husband was able to get the hood latched but it wouldn't close all the way. Luckily they were able to fix that problem. Here I am 2 1/2 month down the road (still under 1000 miles) and today I had the same constant electric warning noise and burning smell with once again, no warning signs to what it could even be.  Luckily it happened twice today and my husband remembered to take a video of it so I will be able to show the dealership so they don't thing I am crazy. (Last time they tried to ask me if it could have been the eco hybrid mode shifting. They treated me like I was making things up.  I am a woman and I don't know that much about cars but that sound and smell is not normal and anyone that would experience that would know that. Plus, my husband was with me two of the three times it happened and he is VERY knowledgeable with cars and has no idea what it could be.)On top of that, it says I'm supposed to get an average of 28mpg city and half of my miles have been on the freeway yet my average MPG is always around 17 MPG. I'm by no means the most fuel efficient driver ever, however, I also don't slam on the gas or speed around. I have a newborn with me 98% of the time so I'm a very cautious driver. What is the point of paying more for a hybrid if it doesn't actually give you better gas mileage. I paid top dollar for a fully loaded vehicle so I could feel safe with my family in this car and so far it's UNFORTUNATELY been nothing but a headache. I love everything else about it. It's comfortable, the tech package is fantastic and it looks amazing. However, thise issues are some HUGE deal breakers. We normally purchase from Infiniti and now in regretting using their sister company. The service and the vehicle has been so much less than what we are used to and expect. I normally don't write reviews unless I have a superior experience or a horrible experience. People need to know about these issues. Especially because this is such a new car that there really isn't anything online about it. I'm really hoping that I'm the only one. Other than that, the car is beautiful and comfortable. I'm hopeful that they can figure out what is wrong because I want to love this car.",3

In order to open your trunk, you have to be outside to do it.  it isn't a huge issue, but it can be a little inconvenient. There is a button in the other feature package Murano's.

That is OK for Nissan and you IF YOU live in the same neighborhood.  With the business traveling I do some times I am hours away from the nearest Nissan Dealer.  To date Nissan has not given me a brand of full synthetic to use.  The manual has a D I Y  section that will only say it should meet these specifications.

They are extremely comfortable and I would include it as a luxury vehicle. Getting in and out is so easy if you have a bad back such as I do, and I love the captain bucket chairs! The Bluetooth is much improved since my 2009 LE. It is much more comfortable than the Lexus. There are really only a couple of improvements that I would suggest. The safety warning signals could be a little louder and the around town gas mileage is not very good but great on the highway. I would not consider any other SUV in this price range as it is superior to all others.Just a couple of other cons cons. One is that there are a couple of blind spots in the vehicle. Because of the beautiful styling the view looking to the passenger side can be obstructed so you have to get used to that. The other obstructed view is out the rear window. I took the headrests out of my back seats to help with this. When you do your test drive you should make sure you can handle that. Also, the sound controls on the steering wheel are hard to use while driving but the dials are so conveniently placed that I wouldn't worry about that.It should also be noted that text messaging only supports android phones and is not compatible with an iphone thus I only gave technology 4 stars.

I've never owned a Nissan before but I liked the size of the back seat in the Murano since I have 2 very tall teenage boys and I wanted to make sure they fit comfortably. The front seats are also very comfortable and it is a nice ride. But there is one very annoying issue.  When my kids sit in the back, they inevitably step on my seat belt thereby tightening it on me while I am driving!  The front seat belts come out of the floor and there is no protection around them.  At the very least, this is an EXTREMELY poor design and quite possibly a safety issue.  I'm also disappointed that I've already gotten recalls on the airbags and brakes.  Nissan is not doing a good job building my confidence in them, this may be my first and last Nissan purchase.",4

I am shopping a car for wife now and test drove a BMW 535 xDrive (my wife's choice).  I was so surprised when I set in the BMW. The sale person saw the surprise on my face and mistaken that I was awed by BMW.

So much so that we bought a used 2012 Murano for a second car. This Murano replaced a 2006 Honda Odyssey, and while I thought the Odyssey was comfortable and an OK ride, even in the rear, this Murano beats it hands-down.  The gas mileage, combined with the size of the gas tank, gives about 425 mile endurance/tank, and the seats and driver position make that distance almost effortless. The interior quality and trim, along with the options and tech, make this vehicle close to a luxury vehicle. We now have about 3,000 miles on it, and are still discovering things (primarily tech related) that the vehicle does. Initially, it took me some time to get used to the somewhat reduced visibility caused by the high seat backs and the rear pillars, but have discovered that it's a non-issue. I have not experienced the emergency braking assistance, but the blind spot alerts and the cross-traffic warning system are a great addition to the vehicle. My wife loves the intelligent cruise control; I haven't decided on that feature yet.

Had the car for about a month and 800 miles. Yesterday morning the brakes failed as my wife was pulling out of our driveway. Nearly backed into a light pole and crashed into our neighbors car. She had to place the car into drive while it was still backing up, then had to place the car into neutral when it started going forward. Brake pedal did not respond and was near the floor. Contacted Nissan consumer affairs about the issue and had the car towed to my dealer. Nissan consumer affair advised me that there wasn't any brake related recalls for my car. A quick internet search proved that to be incorrect. Nissan, not wise to lie to your customers. Luckily this happened near our driveway in a residential neighborhood, with no kids in the car because I dropped the kids off at school in my car this morning. Had this been at a busy intersection, thing could have turned out really bad.  Any Nissan executives reading this post, take a moment and think, what if this was your family in your product. Get the issue resolved before it claims innocent lives. Feel free to reach out to me. Find my contact information on the Nissan Consumer Affairs case #24317348.I will be posting my story on every Nissan forum and consumer complaint site I can think of.",3

I have driven Nissans such as the Altima and Maxima and was always very impressed with the pickup, the way the cars handled, the interiors, the finishes and the beauty of the cars.  Well, It was time to by a new vehicle after owning my last Honda for 18 years (and will NEVER buy a Honda again when the perfectly maintained car blew its engine at 92K miles and Honda would do nothing, except loose a customer FOREVER) and then I saw the resigned Murano.  This car sent be right over the top.  I am not a car nut but then I saw this and it was instant love.  The test drive was perfect.  great on the street, terrific pickup with no lag, smooth as silk cornering ability plus the sexiest of both interiors AND exteriors.  People have been stopping my and asking what car is that.  I scream 'Its the new Nissan Murano and you have to buy one.""  It is so luxurious on the inside pickups like a dream and corners on rails, so you can make it whatever you want, a Sport SUV or one that fits your driving style.  Personally pickup without lag is extremely important to me as are making smooth turns with a hard turn of the steering wheel.  This vehicle delivers on both and so much more.  Hey this LA where you are driving next to cars out there for 100K to 2M and this car with its 20 inch rims and flashy new design still have people looking so the redesign is also beautiful.  The one criticism I don't understand it cargo space.  Mine has a ton when my rear seats are down.  I recently put in enough planning material for a 40' hedge so I am not sure what the critics are talking about.  When the seat are up, there is still plenty of room for all the sporting gear, groceries, etc.  This car is a winner.  It is a 5/5 and worth every penny.  It is the best car I have ever owned and one of the best cars I have ever driven in.",5

488, on 09/28/16 18:20 PM (PDT),RichieP ,2016 Nissan Murano  Platinum 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Murano Platinum vs Mazda CX-9 touring," I struggled with this decision long and hard.  I like the styling of both cars. Both cars have their positives and negatives. First off, I didn't need or want 3rd row seating, so if this is a deal breaker, go with the Mazda.  After owning a few SUV's and being a home owner, I can never go back to owning a sedan.  To start I traded a Lexus 2010 RX 350.  A wonderful car with no complaints.  It is just too generic and boring.  I had a silver one and it is one of the most common SUV models I see and there is nothing exciting or exceptional. Just good old fashion reliability. Nothing wrong with that.  I just got bored after 5 years.  I started looking at other make and models and noticed that most are variations of the same theme.  From the Kia, to the Audi to the Lexus, they all just seem very similar.  I even rented a BMW X-5 and an Audi Q5.  Ridiculously complicated. I had to stop and pull over in the beemer to put the windshield wipers on. Come on!  And to put the shifter in reverse you push it forward!  And forget about using the entertainment system.  Moving on, I wanted a vehicle that was both style and comfort, economical and practical.  Something I thought was  impossible.  I was not going spend upwards of $50,000 on a car.  Enter the Murano. Outstanding style. Easily the most comfortable drivers seat ever. The Mazda was quickly ruled out when I found it only had 6 way seats.  The ""zero gravity"" seats in the Murano are the best I have experienced.  There are missing features that I miss from the RX, such as automatic dimming headlights and the rain sensor windshield wipers found in the Mazda. But the trade off is the heated steering wheel ( I live in the cold northeast) and the panorama sun roof.  Also the cooled seats cause it also gets hot up here.  I also think the Murano is by far the best looking SUV out there.  It is only missing the status branding of the Lexus or the BMW.  That is important to some but not to me.  I would rather have the money in the bank.  Otherwise, I love the CVT transmission, but I am not a driving nut and need for speed testosterone guy.  I want safe and quick acceleration when needed. But I prefer comfort and gas economy over acceleration.  I average 23.3 overall and get 30-31 MPG on the highway. For a SUV with all wheel drive and 6 cylinder this is outstanding.  The entertainment is Bose and is awesome.  The GPS is typical; almost useless, but I have had that with every in car with GPS.  I just use google maps and am done with it.  The ride is smooth and quiet. Some have said the 20"" wheels do not handle to bumps well, but I disagree.  In New England the roads are terrible from winter frost heaves and the large wheels just seem to glide over them. Much much better than the Lexus.  My complaints are:  The Nissan Apps are useless. They would be better to have eliminated them rather than release something that just doesn't work.  But overall, who cares.  Also it takes just too long for the entertainment system to read connect to the iphone, that I can't listen to the radio for minutes when starting the car.  Another very annoying feature is the stupid constant dinging when the car is in the on position and driver's door is open. Say you want to listen to the radio in a parking area and leave the driver's door open.  I don't know how to shut this feature off and car manufacturers should stop trying to appease the dumb downed idiots.  With keyless entry it is impossible to lock the keys in the car, so let me listen to the radio with the doors open. So to summarize, I love the vehicle, the style, the ride and the features.  I do not believe there is a better car for the money than the Murano.  If you are struggling with the decision, take each for an extended test drive and notice the seating comfort between the two.  I am not looking back. There is nothing else out there that compares. One year update:. I'm still very happy with the comfort. I get incredible gas mileage averaging 24 MPG and actually see 30 MPG highway. The features I dislike: can't open sunroof shade manually. Can't use cruise control without""active"" cruise control which I feel is dangerous as it brakes and slows the vehicle at unnatural speeds. It also takes too long for the radio to load up the software upon first starting the car. If I'm running errands and do a lot of in and out this can be really annoying. Lastly the wind noise with the sun roof open is loud. Very loud. So much so I rarely use it.Update 4/4/18. Nothing new. I still love it . No problems or issues after 33,000 miles.",4

Our other vehicle is feeling lonesome as we tend to drive the Murano for most non-cargo trips. Vehicle takes a little time to get used too - especially when parking, but that may be because we are used to a larger, higher-standing SUV; once you figure out when/where how to maneuver everything is good. Safety features - included blind-spot detection, all-around camera views are great, but our favorite so far is the distance-sensing cruise control as it lets us pay more attention to the crazy vehicles than to the speedometer. Cargo area is pretty good for most standard things - shopping for groceries for example, and rear seats can be easily lowered (and stood up) when necessary. No that it really matters, but this car has the largest glove compartment we have ever seen and we sometimes have to really look to find an object we have placed in their.",5

The problem is that the headrest will not permit them to come back up without moving the front seat backs or the whole front seat.  I called the dealer and they said it was just the way it was manufactured and we could remove the rear headrest.  Not.  They are hard to straighten manually (I assume because of the motors).",5

It had almost 40k miles on it, but it was in showroom condition, and after 14 months, still is.  It is the most comfortable SUV I've driven, by far, and the interior is that of a much more expensive brand.  The CVT transmission is terrific, with no jerks or pauses at all, and the power is exactly what I wanted with the 6 cyl engine.  I know the 4s are better than in the past, but still not enough power for me on the highway.  The cargo area is quite roomy, particularly with the 2nd row seats folded down, and the rear leg room is much better than similar sized vehicles.  I cannot say enough about the comfort of the front seats.  I would recommend purchase of either the LE or Platinum version of the Murano, because it truly is a luxury car at a reasonable price.  My only regret is that this otherwise perfect Murano was not equipped with the Navigation feature.  Other than that, it was exactly the vehicle I was looking for, down to the exterior and interior colors.  If I ever purchase another SUV, it will likely be a Murano, as additional features have been added in years subsequent to the 2011.",5

As well as an airbag covering her feet and legs, amazing.  Our insurance did it's job but we had to locate another vehicle.  Well we loved our 15 Murano so well, we started looking at the 2016 Murano.  We located and then purchased a 2016 Murano.  The Premium model had AWD, and many new added features.

I was driving a Infiniti 35 before this car. I was looking for something a little bit more roomy, sporty looking and capable of holding my friends of similar stature.  I saw the Murano and immediately loved the look of it. I know it's a bold design but it's flawless in my eyes. Its sporty, the interior is great (I have the arctic blue exterior with black leather interior) and I LOVE IT! I would caution anyone with kids not to get the S or SV as it's cloth and don't get the cashmere because it is too light in color. I couldn't believe for the price I am paying the quality of the vehicle that I'm driving.  I believe that the car is comparable to a Infiniti Q70 which I was looking into but was way too expensive for me. It has a lot of the same qualities just not the big budget name. The car handles smoothly at all speeds (I've gone 75 in it so far). Fuel efficeny has got me going 450 miles per tank.  The viewing angles are great and the blind spot monitoring, 360 degree cameras, are very helpful as well. I believe that I am riding in style with this SUV with a lot of curb appeal.  The cons of the SUV are few and far between but the USB'S aren't fast charging so that is unfortunate. The Nissan Connect doesn't allow any other apps except for Google Search so no Pandora, no I <3 Radio or others. (I hope they release an update for this). Also I don't like that I have to hit the lock button before the auto start on my remote. (I wake up at 4:30am for work and hate that it beeps and may wake the neighbors. (Again a small flaw but I'm considerate).  Again the car is fantastic and I'm very happy with it. There are multiple tools to learn about the SUV. Overall I'd give it a 4.7-4.8 rating out of 5.

You'll feel like you are driving a luxury car when riding this one. I'm coming from a lease of the Ford Edge and I felt that it was a big upgrade, thinking mostly of all the features that are included in the Murano. The ride is just as smooth as the Edge, even though not as fast acceleration and a bit less cargo room, but nevertheless, the trade off is worthwhile. If you are looking for cross overs without the need for a 3rd row, I'd recommend to at least take a look at the Murano.",5
511, on 07/06/16 06:03 AM (PDT),Dan ,2016 Nissan Murano  S 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Great 2 Row SUV," Pros:  S version finally is not lacking on options and standard features.  I have NAV option and it's great for the money.  S w/ NAV is about $1200 or so cheaper than SV.  Great ride; super comfy seats; great electronics and easy to use; lots of space for passengers; good gas mileage: 18 city, 26 HWY real world - 1500 miles so far             Cons:  Blind spot is an issue but not as bad as it seems; gas mileage in city is not close to sticker; towing figures are laughable... you could easily tow 3500 lbs as it's the same engine and trans as the Pathfinder.   I towed a 18ft ski boat easily with my old 2003 Murano.  the only issue with towing is the hitch sits really low which is probably one of the reasons why it's not recommended.  I recently towed a jet ski 550 miles each way and on mostly flat surfaces with little wind got 23 mpg at 74mph average.  On a recent 100 mile trip gas mileage climbed to 26mpg at 80 mph.  Overall this SUV is fantastic for the price.  Nissan discounts these so dramatically that it's by far the best SUV for the money.",5

As we were leaving, we decided to stop at the Nissan dealer as we had heard about the zero gravity seats in the Murano.  She sat in one and the decision was made.  The pros were seat comfort, more interior room, better color choices and combinations, luxurious interior that rivals the luxury brands and nice exterior styling.  The cons were about $8K more expensive, lower gas mileage, little extra cargo room over the CRV considering how much bigger the vehicle is, leg room could be a bit longer.",4

515, on 06/12/16 17:49 PM (PDT),Ralph Smith ,2016 Nissan Murano  Platinum HEV 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid S/C CVT),Luxury for Less," We owned a 2016 Acura RDX. After 3 months, we traded it for a Murano Platinum SUV. We found a dealer willing to give us an even trade. It was a good move.The Murano has been designed with the user in mind; not necessarily for the computer geeks or engineers really into auto design.The Murano has a navigation system that is reliable, easy to use, and provides useful information because of the way it is combined with Sirius/XM. It provides real time traffic issues. It shows the weather in our current area or where we are going as a destination. It lists stocks that we have entered and wish to follow. Entering a waypoint on a trip is a cinch. The sound system is excellent. It has a number of speakers that delivers great sound from our SiriusXM radio or a CD or the HD FM stations available.There are various options in the dashboard display. A driver can find just about any display he or she finds useful. I prefer the one that shows the next turn in our trip and also displays the radio station current being used with the SiriusXM system. When the navigation system is not being used, I like the compass displaying the direction heading.The transmission is very smooth and acceleration is good. It isn't a race car but passing is easy and we can get extra power when needed. It also uses regular gas. The CVT transmission is much better than some other luxury brands. I cannot feel the car shifting as we accelerate.I have had some back issues. A primary reason for buying the Murano is the comfort of the front seats. They are very comfortable. It is a pleasure driving this car. It is a luxury vehicle for a few thousand less than others (such as our Acura) with easy to use features and superior comfort. No back pain with the seats in this car.Service has been good at the Nissan dealers we have used. I use synthetic oil and can drive 7500 miles or more between oil changes. The heating/ cooling system is easy to use and works well.No problem with this car at all. There is one thing I would change: there is a bend in the hood of the car that displays a piece of metal right in front of the window. We have a white car. The sunlight that reflects off of this metal is blinding. I will consider going to a body shop to add a different color and finish to this piece of metal that is uncomfortable because of the blinding sunlight.The car is comfortable, easy to drive, handling is excellent, the sound system is exceptional and reliability is superb. This is a great car. Nissan offering a Murano that is better than many other luxury cars at a cheaper price.",5

517, on 05/19/16 15:26 PM (PDT),AR M ,2016 Nissan Murano  Platinum 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),2016 Mo Mo," If you're looking for a mid size suv or crossover and don't at least test out the Murano, you would be foolish.We can afford luxury brands, however went ahead and purchased a Nissan. This car is an Infiniti in disguise.First we looked at the Audi Q5 and BMW X3, both we liked, great handling and quality but 10g more and premium gas.We then looked at the Lexus RX which we almost bought at $60,000. The NX is cheaper but to cramped inside.Off to Acura, RDX was to small and we had no need for 3 row seating, so didn't really consider the MDX. We also really liked the new Mercedes GLC but at 60g fully loaded was just to much and I couldn't adjust to that screen plastered on the dashboard like an after thought. My wife saw a new Muranoat her work and we decided to go test drive one. Let me tell you, this car has plenty of quick acceleration. I like that it still has a V6 wheneveryone else is going to 4 cylinder turbos that need premium gas. Out of all the cars we test drove, the Murano was definitely the most comfortable.Sure it doesn't handle like a German car but it rides very smooth and the seats are awesome. I actually love the CVT transmission, it will surprise you and shifts gears (without gears) very well. This car has every option compared to a 50,000 or more crossover/suv. Its not to big but definitely bigger then the NX, RAV4 and Santa Fe. I'm not a fan of the Nissan Connect, but Spotify and Pandora work great. Navigation is very well done and the all around view cameras are awesome. My android phone works flawlessly with the system and text display. I hear Apple though, not as well and needs to be plugged into the usb port to use the apps. However my wife's IPhone works great with Bluetooth for music and hands free phone but not for the apps.We definitely wanted a crossover that had remote smart phone starting but the key fob remote start surprised me on how well it works through buildings and up to almost a football field away line of site. I do wish it had Apple car play or Android auto, but overall were very satisfied. The Murano will surprise you on what you get for 40,000 loaded out the door. Seriously if you're shopping for a crossover or suv, at least take a look at the Murano, Nissan really surprised us.",5

Very comfortable, enough power, decent mpg and nice to look at. They seemed to have gotten the CVT figured out, it's not offensive, which is high praise because until this one I've had no use for them. If you tow things, go mudding or want a sports car in SUV clothing this isn't it. If you're an empty nester and need to haul your stuff around on trips this is as good as it gets. Let me mention again - this car is really comfortable. The computer interface is well done, it's intuitive and easy to use. The interior materials are very nice and the layout is spacious. I really like the motor, it's got plenty of power and uses regular gas. I don't have much use for twin turbo 4's that need premium which are what the majority of its competitors are doing. All in all we're very happy with this car, if you need an SUV and want a comfort cruiser this is definitely worth a look.Well its been 2 years and everything I mentioned previously is still true. No problems, good gas mileage and you can spend all day driving it ant you won't be beat up when you're done. Really an outstanding traveling car.",5

Ride is the feel of a luxury car, not SUV feel.  I was totally caught off guard when I sat in and drove this Murano Platinum.  I wanted a Honda Pilot but it was too high for me (I am 5'9"" previous back surgery, need another and severe arthritis).  So I had intended on buying a Honda CRV.  That was until I read reviews, watched videos of reviews, saw, sat and drove the Nissan Murano Platinum.  I couldn't be happier!!!",5

So I researched all the SUVs - hated the same old rounded body style and the mini van backs of the Durango, equinox, etc.  Finally decided on a 2018 Nissan Murano and I am just blown away - it is the most BEAUTIFUL SUV I have ever seen, driven, experienced.  It's roomy, classy, quiet, comfy soft seats, such a great price... and the gadgets and technology just blows me away.  Safety features are really amazing also.  The only thing it doesn't do is make me a sandwich while I am driving down the road !  ha   Maybe that will come standard with my next Nissan Murano.",5

First off let me start by saying that I don't understand the Edmunds review. They praise almost everything about the car ie….. comfort, interior, styling then give it three stars? This is a major upgrade over my previous Murano. The interior is better than what I have seen in luxury models. It may not drive like a sports car which is one of the critiques from Edmunds. It's not a sports car, it's an SUV designed for comfort. If I wanted something that rattled every time I hit a bump in the road I would have bought a sports car. I am very happy with my purchase and would definately buy another one. I think that's the highest praise you can give a vehicle.",5

Over the years, we have leased mostly Lexus and more recently Volvo cars.  Going into retirement, we wanted to buy so we could own in a few years and not have a payment.   So after 1year of researching cars in the same range as the Murano, we were able to narrow down our choices to 3 cars.  After driving the Murano, we were sold.  The interior was far superior to the other two cars on our short list while the price was comparable.   Very happy customer thus far.",5
526, on 08/22/18 09:38 AM (PDT),Rob Murdock ,2018 Nissan Murano  Platinum 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),My wife is ecstatic!," My wife said it was getting harder & harder to steer her 2011 Lincoln MKX (due to shoulder injury), which replaced a 2007 Lexus RX350. We test drove a Murano & it had effortless steering.  It has better styling than the RX (IMO).  The current Lexus styling looks too angular and the front end looks like a ""cow catcher"" on a Transformer or Gobot. The Murano is WAY less in price and the Platinum model has everything but a microwave! It handles like a sports car, has very comfortable seats, great driver assist features, intelligent cruise control, etc. etc.  Better mileage than either the RX or the MKX, albeit at 260 hp vs 308 for the MKX and 275 for the RX. The voice recognition actually works (didn't on the RX) and there's no ""mouse"" for navigating the main menu.  There are knobs & buttons instead of ""sliders"" for climate and volume control.  My only concern is the CVT, which shifts smoothly and has a ""manual"" mode for downshifting on hills, etc, but with proper maintenance should be ok.  I wouldn't tow anything, but there is a package for that.  Stock wheels look like the blade from a Skil saw, but there's a factory option for 20"" polished alloys, as well as aftermarket.  We had rented a Murano on a vacation last year & I was impressed with it.  Another great thing is that my wife's Murano was built in Ohio 🇺🇸.  I'm so impressed with her car I have decided to offload my 2014 MKX and my own Murano! Love this vehicle!",5
527, on 08/13/18 18:39 PM (PDT),Paul ,2018 Nissan Murano  SL 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Murano SL or Rogue SL," Traded in my 2014 Rogue SL with the premium package for a Murano SL Midnight Edition. I miss some features found on my Rogue but not available on the Murano. The theater seats with fore and aft adjustments in the rear. The large cargo area with hidden floor storage. Led headlights, only come on Murano  Platinum, and most of all the lane assist feature. The Murano is quieter, smoother rideing, even on the 20"" tires and better looking. I  should have done more research on the Muranos features, but I did get a really great deal. If you are considering both vehicles go for the Rogue SL with premium package, the Led headlights and rear theater seats are great features. I just did not want another Rogue so thought the Murano, at higher pricing, would match features. Oh well my wife likes it and that is all that counts. Two negatives on the Murano very weak brightness controls on instrument panel and the kick opening tailgate is not always cooperative. Will be returning to dealer. I do like the car just wish it was a true upgrade from the Rogue.",4

530, on 07/27/18 09:09 AM (PDT),Tim ,2018 Nissan Murano  SL 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),What an impression for my 1st SUV," I've owned sedans my entire life but with a recent purchase of a home I started feeling I needed to get a truck or SUV to assist in the maintenance of the home. My trade was a Camry XSE V6 that I really loved. I found the Murano SL with panoramic sunroof had all the features I wanted at a very attractive price (I would have paid about the same for 2018 maxima or camry) Once I saw the vehicle and sat in it I was really surprised. It didn't drive like some big clunky truck but more like a really high end caddy. Everything was very smooth, acceleration, road noise, and this SUV ate up bumps and imperfections on the road like they didn't exist. I absolutely love the 11 speaker 2 subwoofer Bose system. with that system you wouldn't hear any road noise anyway. The cabin was amazing, I got the cashmere Leather interior and all leather surfaces were covered with a rich light beige leather that was very soft to the touch. The wood grain almost resembled a marble type appearance and was reminiscent or a modern grey/white kitchen. It looks really high end (even nicer than you see in most luxury brand SUV's. for a price barely over 30K this SUV was loaded to the hilt with every possible technology feature, cross traffic, auto cruise control, heated seats, mirrors, steering wheel (although not much demand for that in FL). After a couple hundred miles I already don't know how I lived without the 360 camera with motion sensors. It makes parking a vehicle much larger than any sedan I owned extremely easy. The cabin and seats are among the most comfortable I have ever sat in, the seats have great reviews which are well deserved. the back seats even recline (which may be common for SUV but I've never seen it). I'm still learning the voice commands, android auto, and I haven't played much with the navigator yet but I imagine I'll really enjoy using all the extra technology this vehicle has to offer. Anyway instead of missing my Camry I'm enjoying my new found passion for SUV's. Good Show Nissan!",5

Back seat is roomy and a plus is that the back seats partially recline.  Leg room both front/back is generous.  We have a 400 pound friend who gets into the front seat easily and says that it is a comfortable ride.Exterior styling is unique, which we like, sets the car off from the run of the mill SUV.  Cargo space is adequate for our family. Rear/side vision is a bit limited but blind spot warning, and the 360 camera system make up for it.  The vehicle handles well with good acceleration.

548, on 07/29/18 12:13 PM (PDT),Glen ,2017 Nissan Frontier  S 4dr King Cab 6.1 ft. SB (2.5L 4cyl 5A),My first Nissan pickup and probably my last," Purchased a new 2017 Nissan Frontier S model in 2018. Im old school and wanted a no frills pick up. Have always been a GM truck person for 30+ years and have always had really good luck with them. But the new body styles with square wheel wells and smurky front ends were turning me off. So I looked at the 2017 Frontier and did some research and went and looked based on reviews. In my opionion the truck had a design appearance, elected for the extended cab since I really dont need rear seats. The stance was sharp for me but everbody is different. I was shown a 2017 S model with 21 miles on it. Was an automatic with manual windows and locks. No power seats, no tilt wheel. Just a straight forward no non-sense pick up. Took it for a short test drive and thought this might be it so I pulled the trigger and pruchased. After the first 300 miles noticed the extended doors didnt feel right opening and closing. After looking a little more noticed the bolts holding the door hings were loose ,  after tightning up the bolts with lock tight all was fixed. Have noticed also that some push pins or plastic rivots were missing and apparently forgotton at the factory also, obviously quality control does not exist at the assembly plant. After further miles, I noticed that my OEM sunshade purchased at the nissan dealership was sticking trying to remove it at the end of the day. A day came when I went to remove the sunshade a foam strip also came with it which was between the dash and windshield. Also noticed foam was blocking the vents on the defrost side on the dash which it looks like has shifted around. The texas heat apparently melting the adhesive on these areas.  Numerous paint chips have occured already at 3000 miles, turning ratio absoluty blows on this pick up, inconsistant shifting of transmission, noisy ride, hands free calling blows, seats uncomfortable, black plastic already showing fading and warping at tail gate, poor gas milage. Overall this truck really isnt designed to be a work truck and to be used all day. I will continue to have to keep an eye out for those little things that can and will turn into big things.",3

SB (4.0L 6cyl 5A),The Real Deal on the Frontier," If you want a truck-truck, this is your ride. If you want some luxury-style, lots of bells and whistles and plan to use the bed once at year to get mulch for the yard or an occasional project, nope this isn't your cup of tea. The Frontier has changed much in the way of design and alot of car professionals that you might watch on YouTube complain about it being the old kid on the block, but truth be told, good cars and trucks don't have to change much in order to get the job done, just look at the Wrangler and Tacoma, both have long history's of very minor changes. The truck is on a ladder frame, there are lots of hard plastics inside of it and it gets poor mpg. But its a truck. It suppose to get dirty, have stuff tossed in the back of it, go off roading, camping, outdoor adventuring.  While lots of people will complain about it because of its age, honestly that's what appealed to me about it. It's tough, it gets the job done and it's pretty rugged. The V6 Q40 engine is a proven workhorse that Nissan has used in many of it's line up over the years, if you do the regular maintenance you'll easily get 250k out of it, just look on AutoTrader/Craigslist. The tranny is outdated, its only a 5 speed auto, they could definitely put a 6-8 speed in it, but you can also get it in a manual, dude, that's awesome! While it's not as nice as the newer styled Tacoma, it rides very similar and offers just about the same level of comfort and features, lacking a touch screen though. I bought the Frontier because of the value, price and reliability of the engine and tranny.  This truck is not at the top of it's class compared to many of the competitors but one thing I've learned when researching is that most of the professional reviews liked the truck and it's capability and seemed to be impressed by it still being a truck among a newer lineup of fluff-trucks.",4

I replaced a 1999 ZR2 that I loved, but they don't make them anymore and the new trucks cost too much for a vehicle. Poor investment.

The only problems i have so far is a not centered steering wheel and a minor trim fit problem in the cab . The truck seems well built and a value considering the price compared to mid size Chevy and Toyota trucks which are rated better by writers but also cost a few thousand dollars more . I  have the 4.0 V6 and the mileage is less than my previous 2011 Jeep Liberty Sport with a 3.7 V6 . But the Frontier SV is bigger engine wise and weight wise so it is to be expected . A lot of writers criticize the gas mileage of the Frontier compared to similar trucks by Toyota and Chevy . But if you research it . They all have smaller engines compared to the Nissan 4.0 V6 in the Frontier . So the critics of the Frontiers poor gas mileage have made a bad comparison in my opinion . The ride is better than a lot of cars . The off road abilities i have not checked out yet . Ground clearance looks good for off road use . All in all a nice truck at a nice price .,4

Don't get me wrong I have always had Tacoma's and loved them but the new model leaves a lot to be desired.  This Nissan surprised me quite a bit.  I  have read some disappointing reviews so I tried it for myself.  This truck is fast and the transmission shifts perfectly, unlike the Toyota.  I will admit it doesn't get the gas mileage the Toyota got but that was because Toyota fiddled with the transmission to make it shift weirdly to try to get better gas mileage.  This desert runner is smooth and looks great.  I got this truck for an amazing price about $9,000 less than the Toyota.  As of the date of this writing, the reliability of Nissan Frontiers outweighs the Tacoma, Colorado and Canyon.  I am very happy with my purchase.",5

Many say it's getting old..I say it's still got bells and whistles without all the electronic stuff like new vehicles.

They write that the Frontier has below-average gas mileage and a cheap-looking interior.  Well, I get 19-20 mpg in my 2017, which is just fine for a truck, IMO.  You get better advertised mileage in a Tacoma and other models, but drive it and see why: the manufacturers hobble the transmission with sluggish response and shifting to artificially inflate mileage numbers.  The Frontier has a responsive transmission and the V6 has plenty of power to get this truck off the red light.  As to the cheap interior, it is a light truck not a luxury vehicle.  I test drove the other models in this class of light truck and I saw nothing better.  It is well better than the 2000 Ranger I used to own, and worlds better than my dad's trucks in the 1980s.  If you want leather appointment and woodgrain dash, you are looking in the wrong class of vehicle.  The visibility in the cab is better in the Frontier compared to the competition too, with the pillars blocking much less of the rear view.  The seats are more comfortable than the Tacoma.  The rear seats are a little tight, but not so tight that an adult can't sit back there and it fits a carseat, too.  I don't understand the criticism of the handling, either.  Once the steering is broken in, it has a good turning radius and the engine has enough power to get you through a tight curve hugging the road just fine.  The factory tires could use an upgrade, though, to a Michelin or Goodyear radial.  Overall, I'm very glad I purchased this vehicle and not the competition, and the price is right.",5

Doesn't have the comfort of the Murano, but it's a truck. Nice stiff suspension giving it a solid feel on the road. I was surprised I found one with a manual tranny, 6 speed, because manuals just aren't all that popular anymore. First is very low making it very easy to pull out on hills. There's a feature that aids in minimizing rearward drift starting on hills that seems to work. On level ground you can easily pull out in 2nd gear. Once you shift into 2nd, you can really feel the power of the 6 banger and it's easy to not realize you've jumped to 35mph in no time. Plenty of power for this truck from the 6 cyl power plant. Easy to break traction pulling out way moreso than I've had with my older Nissans. This truck would be very easy for a rookie driver to learn how to drive a stick with. I'm a bit disappointed that there's not more storage inside the vehicle. One map pocket on the back of the seats, but it's in the right place for the driver to get to on the back of the passenger seat. Tiny glove boxes, yes, 2 of them, but they're really small. The console could have better design as there's hardly any storage there, not even a place to put your CD's. Has 2 12V plugs on the dash (handy for your Garmin) and a plug with a usb port inside the console storage box. I don't think the ports inside the console are very well placed and think you'd have to leave the arm rest open to use them. The interior does look cheap, but it's practical with heated cloth seats. At least you won't get burned hopping onto a leather seat when it's hot. The rear seats are full size seats, but not high enough off the floor. Rear under seat storage is poor - can't put a golf bag under them or a tackle box, but you can store some flatter items. Let's not forget, it's a small truck anyway. For short trips the rear seats would be ok for a couple buds to ride along to the golf course or fishing hole, but not for an extended trip unless you're talking like a 25 year old. Not good for us older folks. I would imagine having winter hunting gear on it would be tight as well. Road lighting is fair. I hope I can replace the head lamps with either Xenon or HID lights. Guess I was spoiled with my Murano. The ride itself is not bad. Again, it's a small truck. Would like to have seen 20"" tires on this instead of smaller to get more longevity on tire wear. Overall, it's a pretty nice looking truck. Comes with a bed extender and moveable anchors for tying down cargo in the bed - nice feature. Much of this review is more first impression because I just got this one a few days ago so I can't comment on what I haven't seen yet. Also overall, I'm fairly satisfied with this vehicle. If I can, I'll update my review as things become apparent.",4

SB (4.0L 6cyl 6M),Don't believe the negative reviews," First, this truck is very similar to the original Isuzu I-370 (Colorado/Canyon twin), with some notable exceptions. First, the Frontier still has the tightest steering in its class....and having driven ALL of its competitors, I have no idea what Edmund's is talking about when they talk about heavy steering. I took this new truck, with its 6-speed manual (Nissan is the only company in the world to offer a manual transmission as the standard feature in its power version of their leading light truck!) , up Ute Pass on US 24 west of Colorado Springs. This stretch comprises 10 miles of 30-45 speed zones with very tight mountain turns and switchbacks. Here the 30-45 speed limits are realistic, not restrictive. Yet I took this new Frontier Pro 4X at 65 mph the entire way and did not slip or slide once. The frame is slightly shorter and wider than the Frontier's competitors, so it held the road that much better. I cannot say enough good about this truck. The Bilstein suspension makes it handle better and deliver a far smoother ride than its Isuzu/Colorado/Canyon competition. Moreover, while the competition is busy forcing automatic transmissions down our individual and collective throats whether we want them or not, Nissan is doing it right by offering this superb, proven vehicle in its 2016 off-road version. My gas mileage average in-town is 17.8, and I have had higher from my 2007 Isuzu I-370, which I bought new 11 years ago. The issue of gas mileage is my only complaint so far. For those who want a superb on-and-off-road vehicle with superior power and a manual transmission, I recommend this version of the Frontier above all others.",5

Didn't like the new body style, but bought it because of the past Tacoma experiences. I never owned a Nissan till the 2016 Frontier i have now. I have the SV 4x4 Crewcab 4.0 auto. Toyota has killed the new Tacoma, the new 3.5 V6 has no low end torque at all, all the hp they claim it has is way up in the rpms, might be ok for a car, but not what you want in a truck, the 6spd auto was constantly hunting for the right gear, i ended up locking out 6th gear so it would only shift to 5th and even then it would lose speed going up small grades and forget towing with it. If i had test driven the Frontier before i bought the 16' Tacoma, i never would have bought it! Was so disappointed with it after 3 months i couldn't stand to drive it anymore, pissed me off everytime I'd hit a hill and it would die...I test drove the Frontier and fell in love with the powerful 4.0 V6, plenty of low end torque for towing and pulling hills. Now, compared to the Tacoma, the interior is very plain, but I  fell for the ""pretty"" interior crap before... now i love the in your face ""I'm a truck"" interior of the Frontier! It doesn't pretent to be anything it's not... it just does anything you throw at it. As far as mileage goes, it does just as well as any equally equipped  Tacoma I've ever owned. 19 back and forth to work and 23 highway and with the fully boxed frame this truck also rides and handles better than a Tacoma and it doesn't look like the beds going to fall off when you cross railroad tracks either and the bed is all steel, no plastic junk. My only fear is that Nissan will follow Toyotas lead and ruin the next gen Frontier like Toyota ruined the Tacoma. Please don't  turn this truck into a car, if you guys want a car then buy a car!",5

SB (4.0L 6cyl 5A),Snow crusher," I bought this Pro 4x truck with luxury trim new after much research. I have had about 20 trucks over my years and this one exceeded my expectations. I am tall 6'3"" and wanted a midsize trail truck. I looked at the Tacomas and the leg position is weird with your legs straight out. This truck has a more normal feel but would be better if the driver's seat could track back about 3 more inches.  The view is very open and no concerns. I bought an extra 4 cleats for the track system and a receiver load bar to carry lumber and have yet to find something i can't haul like building my deck.  Ok so my best example in northeast NY is the snowstorm we had last winter. We got 24"" of snow and my wife thought i was nuts playing around in our huge yard testing the truck out and it plowed thru the snow. The only problem was our plow guy blew his transmission before he got to us and she needed to get to work. The RD is a main backroad and where it met my drive way the plowed snow which was harder and clumped was 3 1/2 - 4' tall  and about 4-5 ft across   I was already outside and not going any where so i decided to test the truck some more. Worse case i'm home anyways if i had to shovel out if i got stuck. I put the nose against the snow pile. ( I want to mention that right after i bought the truck I added a 3"" suspension lift and a bull bar up front with LED bar)  so I put the truck in 4x4 low  Differential lock on and slowly hit the pile trying for 6""  and backed out and did this repeatedly about 8 times and the truck broke thru to my amazement to the hwy.  I backed in and out a few times to flatten down the snow. After that  I noticed that the snow on the pile where the truck drove over was flatten down like a toboggan had gone over it. That would be part of the 3 skid plates that are under it.  I don't think it would have worked without the lift but my goodness I did not think it would make it out anyways. This is why I bought this truck. Yes it's dated but i'm old school and if its not broke dont fix it. This truck is built to be used off road so it's not as smooth on the highway as other trims but very comfortable. And boy do I feel safe. The more I use this truck the better I feel about my $40,000 investment including add ons.",4

It has been solid, reliable and has done everything I've asked it to do. I had the windows tinted to help a bit with the HVAC and added a trailer connector from etrailers, that was truly just ""plug and play."" I've only towed a trailer with it once, about 2,000 lbs. However, the truck pulled with a little more effort than usual, but without gasping for air. The truck/trailer combo tracked straight and true.My only real complaints are still the bluetooth on this model is not capable of playing music, only phone. Though a bluetooth adapter that plugs into the AUX port solved that one. The other issue is a minor tendency for the steering to have a vague on-center feel to it. It tends to want to drift ever so slightly off center when cruising at highway speeds. A check of the alignment both at the dealer and a competent tire shop say it is spot on, and so I have lived with it. It is a minor nuisance only and I still love this basic truck for what it is--unapologetically a truck.My truck returns a consistent 22-24mpg, with average after 26K miles of 23.1 mpg overall. I tend to do a LOT of highway driving and I usually set the cruise about 5 over the limit and I am normally around 70-75mph. Gas mileage drops about 1mpg if I cruise around 80 for most of the tank.Would I buy this truck again? Probably, though I'd opt for the V6 next time. If only for the added towing capacity. But, this truck does what it advertises. It is a basic truck with few frills and it hauls stuff when needed and can do some light towing when needed and returns reasonable gas mileage in the bargain.

So I went across the street to the Nissan dealership and test drove the Frontier and fell in love with it.  Really.  I love the way it looks, drives and it was $10k less than a new Tacoma.  I really like that all of the bugs have been worked out of the truck, because it hasn't had a major update in 10 years.  Some will complain about the gas mileage, or that the interior feels cheap, or needs an update, etc..  I am happy with the gas mileage... I didn't buy a Prius.

It is simple, like a truck should be, yet it does have bluetooth and Sirius which are useful, without being over complicated.

Head restraints on back seats block 2/3rds of rearview mirror.  I removed the head restraints to have full view of rear of truck.  GPS/Navigation comes as a premium.  You can have GPS with custom mount for a lot less money and viewing the GPS is just off your right side of the steering wheel  at the 2 o'clock position.  I have used my TomTom 5/7"" on the last 4 Nissan Frontier Trucks with the same custom mount to the dashboard through the top vent of the left A/C vent.  The custom mount goes with me on each sale.  V6 Engine provides plenty of power when needed on the highway or on a city street.  I purchased separately a custom bed cover which enhances the gas mileage about 3% and completes the trim of the back of the truck.  Also keeps the storage area dry.  The bed extender attached to the inside of the bed with side & floor tracks with cleats has always been a must for the truck bed.  I am 6'4"" the Frontier offers plenty of leg room and head room.  So look over the various features and comfort packages to get what you need.",5

SB (4.0L 6cyl 5A),Solid Performer - All around a Great Value," There are a lot of ""PROS"" with this truck. (The biggest one for me was the amazing price that found - couldn't pass it up...).  Aside from that, I a very happy with this pickup.  the cabin is quiet, and it is very stable on the road, even a highway speeds here in Kansas (80+) with wind that can be brutal and sustained... I haven't felt like I was being blown around too much.  I added a tonneau bed cover and it helped the stability a lot, which surprised me.  Braking is very good, I have had to engage the ABS one time already... when a car pulled over on me in city traffic.           If I am picky, there are a few negatives, however.   The first is the overall cabin room, which I would expect to be similar in other models - it took a little getting used to...  I don't notice it any more, but at first  felt a little cramped - and wished that the seat would push back further.  The other letdown was the mileage.  I have averaged 19 mpg, which is mostly highway.   I had hoped with a 6 cylinder that I would be in the low to mid 20's... Overall I am very happy with this truck.  I upgraded the factory speakers - I am an audiophile though - so that was important to me.   I also added Raptor chrome step bars so my daughter and fiancée can get in more easily (both are around 5'3"").  It would have been unnecessary for me though.   I also have towed a trailer with a car on it for about 50 miles, with absolutely no problems.     It doesn't accelerate like my last car (2006 GTO) - but then, what could??  Ha Ha.",5

Last truck was 2009 Toyota Tacoma standard cab 4WD (good truck).   Last full size truck was Dodge Ram 1500 standard cab 2WD 5.7 hemi (great acceleration).   Typical commute to ranch is 220 miles, but last 8 miles are rocky road and last 3/4 mile is Jeep trail.   Wife and I are EXTREMELY satisfied. Mileage from west end of Glacier National Park to east end and return was 23.73!   Mileage from Las Vegas Valley to Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada and back was 20.56, which included substantial 80 MPH speed limits.   Around town mileage is rated 15 MPG and that is what we get, if only town (not typical).   Combined is about 17.5 MPG.   Update after 2 years and over 40,000 miles:  We still love it, although turning radius is not the best.Low RPM torque is excellent.   Pulls grades on I40, east of Kingman, AZ mainly in 5th gear at 75 MPH.   Wish bed light had auto/on/off switch instead of auto with any door opening.   Turning radius is not the best, but no worse than wife's former 2004 GMC Sonoma crew cab 4WD.Wife likes (a) 8 cup holders, (b) upper and lower glove box, (c) wide door pockets and (d) comfortable ride, although it does sidestep around curves over bumps, due to higher profile tires (which we like for going over rocks).   In addition to torque/acceleration, I like under rear seat storage for tools, tow strap, jumper cables, tie downs, etc and room behind back seat for jacket, thin backpack, as well as factory jack and tire tools.   Instruments do not need an operation manual to quickly understand.   Battery and air filter easy to access.   10"" ground clearance on 4WD. Other than a new 92 Nissan Sentra GXE, my only other Nissan was a new 1973 Datsun PL620 P/U.   In 1982 I put a Chevrolet 350 V-8 in it with a 500 CFM Carter AFB on an SP2P Edlebrock manifold, hooker headers, dual exhausts, Chevrolet turbo350 auto trans and a shortened/resplined 2.92:1 differential (for traction).   This factory Frontier is almost as much fun!...and it has 4WD and air conditioning.At 20 months and 34,000 miles we remain extremely satisfied.   - SportsterDoc",5

I have been pleased with every truck I have owned from Nissan clear back when they were still Datsun trucks.

SB (4.0L 6cyl 5A),"Nice, No Frills Crew Cab SV 2015"," I bought this truck because I wanted a 4x4 midsize truck that would fit in my garage without paying 35+ thousand dollars. It is a nice, reliable truck that is fairly comfortable in the front and I like the heated cloth seats. I drove 1000 miles straight thru and had no problems. However, the back seats are terrible and I would feel sorry for anyone who has to ride in the back. Luckily, I am generally the only one in it so for me it isn't a problem. The infotainment system is ok, but not great. I have trouble with the primary apps (Pandora and Iheart Radio) dropping off occasionally and the speakers aren't great. It has dual climate control which I love. I also like the value package that came with the truck that allows for tying down cargo in the bed, along with the bed extender. My biggest and loudest complaint is the awful, terrible gas mileage. The truck has plenty of power, which is nice, but it is at the expense of gas mileage. There are full-size trucks out there that get way better fuel economy. In all, it is a nice reliable truck. I like it and would recommend it, but just understand what your getting. I am leasing this for another 1 1/2 yrs and will probably let it go primarily because of the gas mileage. However, if they can improve on the fuel economy before my lease is up then I would have no problem getting another one, because it is a nice truck otherwise.",4

I took it to Washington in the Cascade Mtns during a snow storm.It was a little squirrelly to drive.While I was thrre, I purchased new tire chains for my semi truck, so I put about 400 lbs in the bed.Not sure footed, but not squirrelly either.  A set of tire cables did the trick.  Not very happy with the paint quality, despite wax and polish, a stiff breeze scratches it.The truck is definitely not lacking in power, and has straight up beaten my Siverado in straight line acceleration.  The odd thing is, they both average 21 mpg.Silverado: 8 cylinders, 5.3 liter, 4wd, crew cab, mostly highway driving.Frontier: 6 cylinders, 4 liter, rwd, Desert Runner crew cab, with 30/70 city/highway driving.I have been told that the rear seat is very uncomfortable to sit in, and both people likened the seat to a folding chair. My wife says it rides like a buckboard, and runs like her Maxima.  She actually will drive it, where as ""The Behemoth"" (her pet name for my Silverado)She will not drive.  As a happy Nissan customer for years, I will be buying another in the future.Been eyeing the new XD. I'm a pretty big guy.  6'4/ 260 lbs.  I traded up for my 2009 king cab 2.4 liter manual transmission.  Got the price I wanted.  I was able to find a Desert Runner, in Silver with the hokey decals already removed.  Maybe I'm used to semi truck brakes, but I have no trouble stopping my Frontier.  I expect the audio system to go first.  My wife's second Maxima is the only one (out of six) that didn't fail.  I question Nissan'sInterior color choices, and the materials seem flimsy, but they are very durable.If you want fluff and gadgetry, look elsewhere.  If you want a solid, well  made, Reliable and durable car, buy a Nissan.  I have owned Nissan since 1987,  All went 120k miles problem free and I know two of the six are still being driven by our children. I currently own two Chevrolets that I can't say the same about.

SB (4.0L 6cyl 5A),Very Satisfied with My Truck!," Recently I purchased a new Nissan Frontier SV King Cab with the 4.0 V6 automatic, and I really like it. For about two years prior to my purchase, I considered the Frontier as well as the Toyota Tacoma and to a lesser extent the Chevy Colorado. There are several reasons why I chose the Frontier over the Tacoma or Colorado. Among those reasons is way it drives; the Frontier handles very well and feels very solid on the road. The interior and seating position felt more ""right"" to me than its competitors. In my opinion, the Frontier's exterior looks much better than the Tacoma and even the Colorado. Finally, for the money, I believe I got a much better deal with the Frontier, paying thousands of dollars less for what I would have paid for similar features in its competitors.I have owned other pickups in the past, including a Mazda pickup, an older Toyota pickup, and a Ford Ranger, and in my opinion the Nissan Frontier is clearly the best of them all, even though it is really not fair to compare this Frontier to the older trucks. While this particular version of the Frontier has been around for more than a decade, it is still very up-to-date. My truck has Bluetooth, XM Radio, a USB jack, and apps available in the entertainment system. So far, I have hauled several loads and towed a small utility trailer with no problems at all. I am very satisfied with the Frontier and would without hesitation recommend it to others.",5

I enjoy driving the truck as it has plenty of power and handles very well, but the mileage is nowhere near its EPA rating.  I'm getting only 12-15 mpg with 2/3rd of more of my driving on highways.  A lot of full size trucks do better.  What really surprised me is the lack of small features I've grown accustomed to in my GM vehicles.  The lights are manual - you have to turn them on and off.  C'mon!  I had a 2003 Chevy S10 pickup (base work truck model) that had automatic lights.  This Frontier is a loaded model and it doesn't have this feature.  It also lacks a vehicle travel computer showing instantaneous and average speeds and gasoline consumption, miles until empty, etc., nor an outside temperature readout.  I read through the manual to find out if they are hidden behind some function on the radio/info center.  Every GM vehicle I've had since 2007 has all these as standard on every model and trim level.  Also, it didn't have the rear camera, though the manual indicated some models have it.  I expected it on a loaded 4wd full cab 4x4.  Again, a feature that GM is making standard on all vehicles.",3

What a surprise though when driving on highway or any back roads that are posted 50 plus that have curves. You'll need to work that steering wheel to keep the truck on line. I drive school buses, flat noses and conventional, and they handle 10 times better than this truck. Fortunately  for me most, not all,, is local driving.

609, on 12/20/15 18:49 PM (PST),Joe ,2016 Nissan Frontier  SV 4dr Crew Cab 5.0 ft. SB (4.0L 6cyl 5A),2nd Frontier," I originally bought a 2015 SV V6 2WD King Cab (in May 2015).  After using it for 6 months it became obvious there was not enough room in the cab when I needed to carry passengers.  I was also a little disappointed with the lack of features I have become accustomed to in my new vehicles - heated  seats, compass, outside temp, rear camera............While the reviews of this 2015 vehicle were not outstanding, I was happy (overall) with my truck.  It was fairly noisy, but it fit my expectations of a truck.  (I want to be able to carry stuff, with reasonable expectations for performance and reliability.)So after getting a reluctant nod from my wife, I bought the same truck as a 2016 (November 2015).  However, this time it was a 4 door SV with the value truck package.This version is much more usable, with less road noise. Gas mileage is not outstanding, but it's not rediculous (as you might expect from the reviews).  I get 20 mpg consistently (combined). The features and controls work well, and are simple to use.  However, they may be somewhat dated in their design.  Again they honestly meet my expectations for a truck.I did look at the new Chevy when I bought the 2015.  The dealers were unwilling to negotiate on the price, and there were few vehicles available on the lot.  There were no Toyota's available in a 2WD, and the dealers were even less willing to negotiate about the price. To be honest, I may be unlike many who want a pick-up.  I'd really prefer a small/mid pick-up that would be based on a small SUV.  This would likely improve gas mileage, and address the main reason I have a pick-up.  Did I mention I want to have the ability to carry stuff......  I am not a farmer or tradesman, so I don't need all the bulk and capacity of a real pick-up.  I use this vehicle to go to work, shopping, and just general transportation.Given the 3 small trucks currently available in the market, I think the 4 door Frontier is a competent choice.  It doesn't seem to have any of the concerns noted in many of the customer reviews for the new GM's or Toyota, and the gas milage is not significantly different.",4

I bought the truck from a kia dealership as is and have had bad experiences buying as is trucks so I added a 3 yr 36k for close to 2 grand. After the dealer got there cut i ended up paying around 21. Minus 2 k in cash i financed around 19 for a truck with proven reliability and dependability and under 50 k. I researched the vehicle online and the only consistent problem I found was the 4.0 likes to  jump time around 100k. I feel like knowing this and addressing it around 90 k it should be fine, I am not worried. The price of new trucks now a days is stupid. I refuse to pay over 25k for something i am going to beat on sometimes. It has the comforts i need bluetooth, cruise control, room for my kids car seats and a small bed for random stuff with adjustable tie downs. My sister, my son(5) and myself all took a 9 hour trip to eljay, georgia north of atlanta and it rode great. If I want great gas mileage in a vehicle I will not buy a truck. I do a lot of interstate driving about 375 mi a week and this truck is great. I was driving a leased kia soul ( my wife's previous car it is a long story it is what made the most financial sense don't judge) the ride is about the same to me.

I compared the Frontier, Tacoma, and Colorado and decided on the Frontier. I love the look of the Midnight Edition. I went with the granite exterior and the black lettering and wheels are really sharp. Plenty of room in the front for me and adequate room in the back for passengers. I really like the track system in the bed with the movable cleats to secure cargo. The 4.0 liter V6 provides plenty of power and torque. I would like better mileage, but it is really not much less than the competition. I also like that the engine and transmission have been around for a while and have had relatively few problems.  This promises to be a reliable truck. It would be nice to have a better sound system and more interaction with mobile devices, but that is definitely not a deal breaker for me. Oh, and I was able to get this truck new for less than $26k and at 0.9% financing. Tacoma and Colorado could not touch the price and did not look nearly as nice. I would definitely recommend this vehicle.",5

The tacoma had a 2.7 4cyl. Frontier 4.0 6cyl. Frontiers back seat was roomier, and the front seats were more comfortable. The tacoma's exterior was boring. Steaight paint nothing else, plus cheap looking wheels. The frontier had chrome an extended bed and a bed tracking system-nice. Couldn't be happier. I know that tacoma's have been great, but they are asking too much for a basic 4cyl.",5

No transmission issues at all as compared to the new Tacoma.  My test-drive of the tacoma verified what i read here on Edumunds regarding the ""hunt"" for the proper gear.  First long-haul mileage was 23.6, acceptable.   The radio button could be larger for convenience.  IMO, the frontier is a much better value than the tacoma.",5

SB (4.0L 6cyl 5A),Love This Truck," This truck is not very well reviewed by the major reviewing sources in my humble opinion because it is not as fancy as some of the others out there.  However, when you look at most customer reviews they are all pretty positive and so is mine.  This truck is by far the best value in it's class.  Does it have all the bells and whistles that competitors similar models have?  Not necessarily.  However, what it does have is a great engine and tranny, a comfortable interior, all the technology I wanted/needed on the inside, and looks absolutely great.  It is truly a pleasure to drive this truck.  The only real downside I can think of is it's a little rough sometimes on quick accelerations from a stop and the crew cab back seat area is a tad bit cramped and the mpg (but that is the same with most V6 4WD models).",4

SB (4.0L 6cyl 5A),Great all around truck," I have the 2016 Frontier crew cab S model, 4 liter automatic,  the shift is very smooth, great acceleration.  I do mostly city driving, I get any where from 15 to 17.5 mpg in the city and 22 to 24 on the highway. It all depends on how you drive it.  The rear seat leg room is a little small, but the truck will fit in my garage.  Easy for me to get in and out of. Cock pit area is nice.  A/C, blue tooth, entertainment are all very good.  Some of the articles you read about gas mileage compared to Toyota Tacoma are misleading, there are no real noticeable different between the two, maybe 1 or 2 mpg. It's all about how you drive it. Plus the Frontier is somewhat lower in price.  No big deal that the overall styling is pretty much the same for the last 10 years or so, it's reliability that counts. The handling on the high way  holds the road very well, the ride is a little stiff going over bumps, but it's a truck.  I added my own rear view camera and monitor for around $55.00 from Amazon.",5

I bought the midnight edition crew cab which comes with a spray in bedliner, bed extender, rear sonar, heated seats, dual zone climate control and a lot of other goodies.

SB (4.0L 6cyl 5A),A good truck for the money," The Nissan Frontier king cab is a mid size truck which will appeal to people with small or no children as the rear seats in the are very small. The truck is far easier to park and maneuver than large trucks although the turning radius could be better. The engine is strong and the instrumentation is well laid out and simple.   The sound system is fair even with the 6 speakers offered in the value pack. The truck accelerates well and steering is good.  The ride is ""truckish"" and bumps will be felt. Some wind and tire noise can be heard. In order to get the nicer amenities one will have to get the crew cab or an upgraded model such as the Pro 4x. Even with its drawbacks the Frontier is still a nice truck. Nissan kept the cost down by using less costly materials and using the same basic style for many years.  The Colorado, Canyon, Tacoma and Ridgeline are more modern and offer more luxury items but you will pay for them. The Frontier is a sturdy basic truck that will get the job done at a reasonable price.",4

The 2017 Nissan armada platinum has been a disappointment. In just at a year of ownership the battery has had to be replaced, the key fob batteries have been replaced and still give me issues on opening the vehicle and using g for ignition, the engine has had to be re programmed the transmission had issues with pulling while shifting hears so it had to be re programmed the USB ports encasement was not properly built in the abs system has been replaced and now the ADAS system has been replaced.  In all honesty the vehicle has been seen for the same issue (while driving I get. Amessage with all icons on. The dash board lit that I need to pull over stop and turn off the vehicle and restart it. Only to find the vehicle will not re start) this issue is still exists y and no one knows how to fix it because they can't re-create the issue.   Nissan of San Marcos has been no help and Nissan One has been even worse at at least trying to find a resolution.  I highly recommend if you are considering an armada I urge you. RECONSIDER!!!",1
628, on 07/18/18 18:23 PM (PDT),Robert Chaves ,2017 Nissan Armada  Platinum 4dr SUV 4WD (5.6L 8cyl 7A),A $50K SUV that only works on clear sunny days," Let me say I really wanted to like this car.  I had high hopes for it.  I traded a Chevy Tahoe for my 2017 Amada Platinum 4WD and I initially loved it untill it rained and snowed.  The problem is that the car has a ton of electronic safety features but they are too sensitive so when it rains heavily or when it snows and you get a small snow flake on your bumper, the front bumper sonar report a ""front radar obstruction"" issue which the car interprets as you being close to crashing with something so you get uncontrollable beeping that can only be stopped by turning off the sonar from the central console.  One additional quirk is that every time this happens, all your radio presents for FM 2 or XM 2 & 3 (there are three sets of presets) will be lost for 24 hours.  After roughly 24 hours, the presents often (not always) come back.  I've taken the car into service twice for this and brought them video (I've filmed the driver's console during a rain storm showing it showing the ""front radar obstruction"" error during a rain storm) and the dealer has returned it both times stating it is working as expected.  Thus, this is a $50K car that apparently was manufactured to work only in clear sunny days.",2

Read the actual experience of the owners, much more realistic and reflect actual experiences. I love my new Platinum, size, ride, technology, quality are all great. Yes, there is a fuel penalty having a 390hp power plant but that is really the least expensive part of ownership and a trade off I am willing to accept to get the towing capacity.

Less money than Chevy, GMC and Ford for the same type/options.  Hard to see why the GM stuff is so much more. (For the record owned 8 new GM vehicles.)  Compared against the old Ford, in short no comparison ( I have owned 5 new Ford vehicles).  Quite good tow vehicle (very important to me).  Very good room in the second row.  IMPORTANT driver seat ""sits"" high (does go down enough for tall drivers, >6') this is one thing I live with.  V8 has a more pleasant sound than the GM products and is very responsive.  GM products do shift slightly smoother.  The ""bones"" of this truck (sold over seas as the Nissan Petrol) is much more off road focused than either the GM or new Ford products.

I chose an SV because of my large family. The captains chairs in 2nd row were an issue. Even for a “BASIC” model the truck is amazing. The feel of it, the handling, the braking, and the power of the truck are a lot better than the 2008 which I traded in. My 2008 was very well maintained to a point it put money down on the new one, paid for my extended warranty, and put some money into my pocket. Just to give you a sense of how well my 2008 was. Now with all good things come some bad things too. The 3rd row is more like the 3rd row of a Pathfinder than an Armada. Also, NYC traffic limits me to about 12 mpg on gas but while driving on I-95 to Florida and back the system reset itself to give me 18 mpg. Lastly, as someone else stated in a review, the transition from 2nd gear to 3rd gear is weird. It kind of feels as if 3rd gear is not even there. Feels as the truck is being held back, and as you floor it a little bit, 4th gear kicks in and it picks up really quickly at that point.

635, on 10/13/17 10:52 AM (PDT),Lane ,2017 Nissan Armada  Platinum 4dr SUV 4WD (5.6L 8cyl 7A),Nothing Perfect in this World," We took delivery of our '17 Platinum AWD Armada the end of July, 2017 for an OTD price of $57,9. I have had a few months to live with it and have several gripes. The leather used for the steering wheel, door and center console armrests seems very thin. I cannot imagine that it will hold up very well. The rear passenger doors close with a very tiny sound that makes them sound very thin and cheap. Factory floor mats are the thinnest I have ever encountered. Both the carpet and rubber backing seems uber cheap. When you push and release the brake pedal it sounds loud (hard plastic noise?) like they forgot a rubber damper to deaden the sound. The biggest knock I have is that there is a buzzing vibration when the engine gets to 3k RPM. This vibration is felt through the pedals, steering wheel and seat and stops at 3500RPM. When I took the tech with me to demonstrate, he could feel it in the passenger seat. Really annoying but dealer claims ""that they all do it"". I feel like the tranny shifts odd for a big V8. At slower speeds it almost makes it feel like a V6. Once you stomp on it, it moves very well aside from the 3k vibration issue. Stomp on it too much and the penalty will be extreme reduction in an already sad MPG rating. Around town is 12ish. Freeway driving at 70 mph can yield close to 18. Bump up to 85 and your looking at 15 mpg. Had cause to use the seat heaters this week and at least with the driver seat, it was either blazing hot or off. Gonna have it looked at. The seat cooling works fine but nothing to gloat over. The thing looks great and the interior looks very luxurious and gets lots of compliments from guests. We have captain chair configuration and think it adds to the refinement feel. Ours came with the extra USB ports in the rear of the center console and they are great. The auto climate control is not the best that I have seen. I wish it was more consistent. The fan for the rear is pretty loud. Overall, I like it but was a little disappointed in the quality of some of the items. The vibration issue is something that is hard to live with and I will be escalating my concerns until it gets resolved. At this price, I suppose there are some compromises but I do feel that the previous generation Armadas felt more solid and possibly drove better.",4

I particularly like the driver seat/front console configuration which allows for more room than any of the competition.   It has significant luggage room and great space both in the front and back seat which places this SUV at the top of the luxury list.   It is roomier in the front than any of the others save the Infinity which is its more expensive twin.     Room for improvement include 1) on acceleration  ...the way it is geared causes it to rev a little too much, 2) the headlight adjustment finds the dim lights pointed a little low for my tastes and 3) as a technophobe, I'd prefer better instructions with regard to understanding the electronics.

639, on 07/04/17 07:34 AM (PDT),CAR-GUY ,2017 Nissan Armada  Platinum 4dr SUV 4WD (5.6L 8cyl 7A),NEW ARMADA IS THE DEAL OF THE DAY!," We were looking for a BIG SUV for awhile.  Looked at both new and used GMC Denali, Escalade, VW Touareg, AUDI Q5 and QX80.  Some of the prices are just outrageous.  Saw this Executive Driven (had 4,000 miles on it) Armada Platinum and was totally impressed in the fit and finish as well as the ride.  The interior is really high-end. Exterior color - Copper Red - VERY rich metallic.  You do not think you are sitting in a NISSAN and my wife compared it to the quality of an Audi, Escalade, and Denali.  No difference than the QX-80 except in price AND gas requirement  (same engine - 390HP (regular) for the Armada, 410HP (Premium) for the QX-80).  Traded in a 2008 Mazda CX-7 that needed Premium gas (averaged about19MPG vs, the ARMADA at 16.2MPH w/ regular). When you compare SUVs needing Premium instead of Regular, the ARMADA is actually cheaper to run than the smaller CX-7 was.  Same goes for ANY SUVs you compare it with.  For only 20HP more, the QX-80 needs to burn premium. You will NOT notice a 20HP difference.  SO, it is not worth the added $28,000 sticker price (or 60-80 cent price difference in gas grades). List sticker on the Platinum was a little over $63,000. Same loaded QX-80 $91,000+. Denalis and Escalades cost even more money and I do not see paying the premium for them.  As the title says, it is The Deal of the Day.  Rides well and I am impressed with the pick-up and interior quality on it (other car is a Bentley Flying Spur).  If you need the extra towing capacity (8500 pounds), everything is standard - so are bigger brakepads, heavier suspension, etc. comes with it. If you don't tow, you still get the added heavy-duty parts.(no optional Tow package - everything is standard and that should add to resale value later when you sell).ALSO - got the extended warranty from NISSAN to go to 10 year, 120,000 miles.  If you are going to keep the SUV for awhile, this is a great investment.  It covers everything - except the usual wear-and-tear items - tires, etc.  (it is transferable - again, think added resale value). To me, great package - and we usually keep our cars a long time.  Had several Nissans before this (2 300ZXs, Axxess, and Maxima)  This truck is based on the NISSAN Patrol which is sold internationally and used by the UN Peacekeeping Forces. (solid).  Although built in Japan, the V8 engine is built in Tennessee (American-made), so you ARE buying best of both worlds.  If you are looking to buy the most you can for your money - this is it!  Unless you need to say you are driving an Infiniti QX-80 to impress your friends AND pay a lot more at the gas pump.UPDATE- after 20,000 Miles - Great choice.  Let me say it again, GREAT choice.  Saving money by not having to pump Premium into it.  Rides very well, just changed out Brake Fluids with another Oil Change and rotated tires. Many people think it's a QX-80 - Save your money and just buy the Armada Platinum.  Went to Dealer and was treated very nicely. This is the best Nissan offers.  Glad we waited til this platform (*based on the Nissan Patrol) came out. Wife enjoys driving it (she is five foot) and is very comfortable in handling it.  No buyer's remorse here. An EXCELLENT buy.UPDATE - Checking in at over 31,400 miles - NO repairs.  Oil and Filter changes have been only maintenance, plus tire rotation, a new cabin air filter and change of brake fluids.  Using some of the technology more.  The GPS map is always good to flick on to  follow what roads you are on and what major intersections are coming up.  Getting a little better gas mileage - 16.4 - 16.8 MPG.  Putting in mid-range gas every 3-4 fill-ups.   Thinking about getting an Exec-Driven Nissan Altima 3.5L.  (a HOT car for the money) for an additional car because all the controls/ screen on it are the same.  Will be keeping the Nissan Armada for a LONG time.",5

647, on 12/15/16 23:42 PM (PST),JRA ,2017 Nissan Armada  Platinum 4dr SUV 4WD (5.6L 8cyl 7A),We love our Armada.," If your reading this review, your likely considering the 2017 Armada. I've long been impressed with the looks and performance of the QX56/80 and when Nissan first released the very similar redesigned Armada, I immediately wanted one. After reading the ""expert"" reviews, I decided to pull the trigger and purchase a 2017 Black on Black Platinum 4WD. My new Armada is absolutely beautiful and is the envy of our friends.  I found it a little odd that I was filling up so freequently but have gotten used to the fact that this beast is just a gas hog. As it stands, we are only getting about 220-260 miles per tank. The freequency of fill ups is excessive and inconvenient. When driving the vehicle, the ride is nice and pleasant. The steering is a little sloppy and steering wheel feedback is lacking. The wheel turns too easily and doesn't return to the neutral position with enough force. A couple additional items to note, the USB port in the front center console charges at a Very slow rate. It's so slow that it barely keeps your phone from discharging while plugged in. Interior lighting is adequate however, it's very surprising to find that LED bulbs are nowhere to be found. The Bose sound system is also very underwhelming. There are very limited adjustments available which include basic Bass, Trebble, fader and balance only. Overall, we are very pleased with the 2nd Gen Armada and proud to arrive in style. **I highly recommend getting the available software update.

649, on 11/19/16 18:43 PM (PST),Michael C ,2017 Nissan Armada  SL 4dr SUV 4WD (5.6L 8cyl 7A),This SUV is a beast!," After driving the behemoth Chevys / GMC's we almost bought the better handling Expedition except the interior was too drab.  The Nissan by contrast is very well designed, comfortable, very (very) quick off the line, handles well and is very quiet.  The auto AWD mode is easy to drive but once you switch to other modes, driving gets clunky fast.  A couple of complaints however, one is with four children and the back seat in use we like to keep the smaller of the middle seats folded.  Unfortunately there is no way to safely secure it in that position, which creates a safety hazard, as it could flip down onto the foot of a third row passenger.  The middle row release mechanism is also difficult for kids to manipulate.  The Nav and touchscreen interface is poorly designed and the bluetooth has trouble switching between phones of different drivers if the first phone is no longer in the car.  Voice commands appear to default only to navigation which is odd.  Those issues aside the performance and driving characteristics of this vehicle are second-to-none in this class.  Basically you're getting the Infiniti which makes this car a great value.",4

So far, it's a great full size SUV. My wife loves it (technically, it's hers). I took it back to the dealer a few days later for the wheel alignment because the steering wheel was off center. The dealer didn't have the wheel specs on 2017 model, but the Technician was able to use the 2016 Infinity QX80 specs to align the wheels. It has plenty of power and drinks lots of gas, but it has very nice safety features for the platinum package. I live in Pensacola, FL, but I bought the SUV in Mobile AL. We wanted to buy it locally, but the Nissan Dealership in Pensacola swapped the 2nd row captain seats to the bench seat after we agreed on the price. Good thing, I asked to see the SUV before I was going to sign the final paperwork. I went Mobile and got everything I wanted in the vehicle w/ the captain seats for $1300 less.",5

653, on 10/27/16 17:34 PM (PDT),Len Burton ,2017 Nissan Armada  Platinum 4dr SUV (5.6L 8cyl 7A),Horrible Owner Experience, I purchased my 2017 Nissan Armada in September and it has been in the shop for multiple issues. I bought my Platinum Armada thinking i wouldn't have any issues for a long time to come. Well that was farther from the truth..... The issues started the day I took it home and its currently in the repair shop for 12 days now for a total of 3 trips now.  I'm wondering if I made the wrong decision in buying a model in its first year on the market... because it has been in the shop for 23 out of the 40 days since the day I brought it home. I have been a loyal customer to the Nissan Brand for many years. I never thought that I would be writing a review about how unhappy I am with my Nissan Armada. Its just painful when you make a purchase of this magnitude and spend your hard earned money for a product that turns out to be a NIGHTMARE. Im not sure how this story will end but its already taken a toll on me. If I had to do it all over again I would have waited another year before buying the Nissan Armada. I have to say its looks nice with all the bells and whistles. When you can't drive your new vehicle without issues all of that goes out the window. Well I will have to wait to see how this all plays out and do a follow up to this review after I get my vehicle back. So stay tuned for part 2 of my saga!!!,1

I love the power the Armada has and I really love the look of the interior. I was shopping the '18 Expedition and '18 Tahoe LTZ (What a boring interior for those dollars!) I previously owned a 2011 Tahoe and didn't care for it  but was considering it anyway. What really sold me on the Armada is the torque and horsepower along with the outside restyling and posh looking interior. The 0-60 time on this vehicle is faster than most cars! It makes me feel as if the people who purchased the Infinity for 10K more kind of over-paid since it is essentially the same vehicle with a few more tech and luxury changes that I can live without. Additionally, it drives like it is smaller than it is. I have only had mine for 3 weeks and haven't had any problems. I am just over the initial break-in period (per the manual) of 1200 miles and I am averaging 16.3 mpg. Believe me, I am not a slow driver but by the same token I am not stomping the gas to leave every stop light; but I want to! The sound it makes! Sigh. Nissan makes a lot of these vehicles and like all makes, there are going to be ""lemons"" produced and someone is going to get them. As far as I'm concerned though, overall the Armada is a fantastic buy for a large SUV.",5

ELECTRONICS:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Currently, we only have 6,000 miles on it since purchase and the entire electronic system is having to be replaced.  All the safety sensors stopped working for lane departure, forward collision warning, etc.  The dealership states that this is what is causing the very poor display of the camera system as the backup camera display is that of a very cheap security system camera that is essentially useless.  It is noted that the electronic system is a 1980's model that i assume they selected to keep the price down from that of the equivalent GMC or Chevrolet compatibles.

That is until you start to drive it.  In another attempt to apparently shave cost off the vehicle Nissan has thinned the sheet metal for the body panels that flimsy.  In fact that the hood is so thin that as you drive down the interstate the hood will flex and bend in the wind.  I assume it is only a matter of time the dents will start to show up on the doors and quarter panels due to this thin material as it will definitely not be able to withstand any type of impact.

That is until you sit on them.  The front and rear captions chairs feel like you are sitting on aluminum bleachers.  The seats are very flat, hard, and not form fitting in any manner.  The best option you have for adjustment are the lumbar support, or incline/decline.

However, in this case beauty truly is only skin deep.  Nissan has taken the infinity look and stripped everything down from that point to make the vehicle as cheap as possible and it show once you have spent some time in it.  If you are looking to purchase one of these vehicles I recommend that you spend more time in it than just a quick test drive around the block.",2

Seats are flat and hard, they don't wrap around your bottom or back.

663, on 09/15/18 07:03 AM (PDT),LonestarBabs ,2017 Nissan Rogue  SL 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Revvy Rogue Really Rocks," I downsized from a Jeep Grand Cherokee to my 2017.5 Rogue SL. I hadn't owned a Nissan since 1988 and boy was I impressed with this Rogue! I happened to be test-driving several pre-owned vehicles (different makes and models) and tried a new Rogue. I was hooked. The car is zippy despite my concerns about a 4 cyl engine -- I accelerate quickly and smoothly for freeway driving and have never felt short of power. Yes, there's a little whine as it winds up for 1st gear but it's not tinny for harsh. I love the big sunroof, gas mileage, BOSE sound system, and the safety features. The interior is comfortable and pretty quiet, although could use more soundproofing on the driver's door -- too much road noise there for my liking and I sometimes doublecheck to make sure my door is closed all the way. I wish the front seats were a bit wider (or perhaps I wish I was narrower) because every now and then I accidentally bump the rocker switch for the seat warmer. I wish the console storage was forward a few more inches for easier reach. I like the convertible cargo area -- handy on grocery day to have that divider in place and have a double-decker of secured items! The interior scratches easily in the cargo compartment (the plastic) and I've discovered there is no touchup paint. The controls are all easily within reach and the car is easy to maneuver. Overall I'm very pleased with this car. Wish I could have afforded the AWD model, but that will have to be part of my next purchase. This car is just the right size for my needs, has all the bells and whistles I want, and is fun to drive! It's comfortable, solid, and has been problem-free in the first year of ownership. I don't like the factory tires and can't wait to change those out, and the dealer-added window tint is a tad too dark for nighttime visibility but overall I love my Rogue and smile when I buckle up! On the highway I get about 33-34 mpg, and combined city/highway I get about 28 mpg. I'm satisfied with the fuel economy.",5

My problem is that rpm goes up 3000 when accelerating to go into traffic, even I speed up only 40 mph in local. It sounds very noises and feels like not speeding up. But dealer said it is normal. Did I buy lemon? I am really depressed.",1
666, on 07/30/18 12:30 PM (PDT),Katie ,2017 Nissan Rogue  SV 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Nissan's best selling SUV is my nightmare," I have owned my 2017 Nissan Rogue SV for just over a year now and have put over 17,000 on the car. For the first 15,000 miles the car was great and never had any issues. Once the car hit 16,000 is when the problems started happening. Lets talk about the good stuff: the car's hide and dived trunk feature is absolutely amazing. Being a mom to a toddler, I can put the stroller on the bottom shelf and still have room for items on the bottom and top self. The rear seats are raised so they sit higher than the front; this is a nice feature if you ever have to sit in the back. But I find it can be a little difficult loading my young child into their car seat because I have to step up higher to access it. (I am sure this is not an issue if you're tall) Due to this being the SV model my car only has the power adjustable driver seat. I have lower back problems so being able to raise this seat and have lumbar support is very nice. The passenger seat is comfortable but during our long road tips in the Rogue, I have found that the driver seat is a better place to be. The car gets excellent gas mileage for being a small SUV. I average about 415 miles per tank and when we go on long road trips, I have seen it up to 480 miles on one tank of gas. (This is without Eco mod on and I can have a lead foot. ) The standard Cross traffic alert and blind spot monitoring are a huge bonus (Especially because this car has terribly large blind spots). Now it is time for the bad: The back up camera on the 2017 (with out the nav) is a joke. The screen is small and the quality of the camera is fair at best. It does get the job done, but I don't rely on it when I am backing up. The road noise on the car is terrible, if I am calling anyone over Bluetooth I have to turn the volume all the up to be able to hear them and most of the time the other person can hear the road. The tan cloth seats are horrible quality; they got stained in 1 week after owning the car and made the car look 10 years old. Nissan's response to that was ""put seat covers over them."" The car is grossly under powered. Merging onto the highway is a little scary and if you have to pass someone, you better make sure you have time because the CVT doesn't want to get the engine moving.  The problems: At 16,000 miles I noticed my Rogue jerking a lot more when I would try to accelerate from stop and go traffic. A slight tap on the pedal would cause the RPMs to jump up to 6 then drop to 0. I took it to the dealership and was told that they couldn't replicate the issue. So in order for me to prove that this was happening, I had to film the issue. Once I got it on film I took the car back at 16,700. (yes it took that long for the issue to happen again). The dealership kept the car for a few hours then called me to say ""it's done"". According to the Carfax report and the dealers paperwork they ""serviced the transmission."" Well at 17,000 the car started to do the same thing and at different times. I took it back and was told the same thing ""we need it on film"". The car currently has 17,800 miles on it and I drive around with a GoPro attached to the cluster gage so I can get the issue on film AGAIN! I took the car to a trusted mechanic to get a second opinion. I was told that the transmission is slipping and probably has a year at best of life left in it. Taking this over to Nissan, they are refusing to look at the car until I can get the issue on film again. Due to it being my only car, I now have to drive around with this potentially dangerous machine until it decides to act up again and have Nissan fix it. This is my 6th Nissan and will be my last.",3

Greatly regret it. My Rogue is top of the line with the Platinum Reserve package. I’ve never gotten the gas mileage that they claim it should get. It sounds like a go cart during acceleration. By far the worst vehicle I’ve ever owned and I come from a family that loves cars. It has been back to the dealership on several occasions, they can’t seem to find a problem. The owner drove it for a week and claimed to get a little better fuel mileage but was also driving 69 miles per hour. When I get out of this Rogue. I will never purchase Nissan again.

673, on 06/17/18 19:45 PM (PDT),Bo ,2017 Nissan Rogue  S 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Disappointing," I always want to buy a Rogue. And finally got a chance to drive one from Hertz's rental. Here is my honest review, Very disappointing . 2017 Rogue S AWD ( 24000 miles) is very road NOISY, tire noises and wind noises. The riding is roughed, it feels like riding a military Jeep. It produces clunky sounds when riding over small bumps and you can feel it hard. This Rouge lacks comfort, even the seats are hard . The acceleration is weaks but acceptable do to 4 cyl , you can't expect this to move like 4 cyl sedan like the Nissan Altima. Don't get me wrong, I like the Exterior and interior looks. Interior design (instruments and dashboard) I give it an A- , but the rear backup camera's screen should be 4×7 standard. I do love blind side assist and working properly. My 2007 Nissan Altima hybrid with 244600.00 miles is riding better than this Rogue, accelerates faster, smoother rides and a lot less noise when driving. I know I shouldn't compare SUV with a sedan. But my points  is that this  is 2017 and only 24000.00 miles compare to  my Altima ( 2.5, 4 cyl) is 11 years older and with 244600.00 miles. My Altima hybrid never had a single tune up. Yes still original spark plugs and the rest of major mechanical parts . Check engine light came on twice when the hybrid bettery died at 175000 miles and oxygen sensor bad. I don't know how this Rogue will holds up when it hits high milage. Conclusion,  I personally will not buy this Rogue because is SO NOISY and CLUNKY.",2
674, on 04/02/18 10:40 AM (PDT),John  Walters ,2017 Nissan Rogue  SL 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Safe driver for Mom," For some reason this vehicle always gets underrated by the supposed experts.  Despite that, sales figures would argue many consumers would disagree as the Rouge has become a very popular seller.  This 2017 SL is my second Rouge having stepped up from the 2015 SV.  This has lots more tech and safety features.  Simple little things like the divide-n-hide rear storage make this a pleasure loading groceries as it helps keep them in place.  The ride is superb for a short wheelbase vehicle and the creature comforts numerous.  The all around camera system is a plus but the image could be better.  The build seems pretty good and the materials better than expected for the price category it's in.  Gas consumption is quite good averaging 27/28 MPG for mostly country driving.  The engine is somewhat underpowered, the CVT works hard at keeping it in the right RPM range for max power when needed.  That becomes one of the knocks against the vehicle.  Personally I didn't buy the vehicle to haul a trailer or for its street rod capability.  Its just a great family hauler that does just about everything well.",4

Overall the Rogue looks good and has some good features, but at 26k miles I had 2 wheel bearings fail, 2 warped rotors, and a loud gyrating sound in the rear end at 40mph. The dealership found that the back wheels were out of alignment causing one of the tires to cup. They did a full alignment and rotated the tires to the front. The helicopter noise is gone now that the tires have worn smooth. The other problems were repaired under warranty All is fine and Im enjoying it.",2

When I was car shopping late last year , I had read several reviews on the Rogue as well as several of the competitors in this class. I then set out to test drive my choices. They were the Honda CR-V , Toyota RAV4 , Subaru Forrester , and the Nissan Rogue.Most American made competitors didn’t make the cut mostly due to high cost and sub par reliability history. The Only consideration was the Ford Escape , but the comparable cost was not competitive. It’s way overpriced. In my test drives , I was least hopeful and most pleasantly surprised by the Rogue. I had read so many poor reviews based on the Rogues performance , acceleration and the cvt. The one I had the highest hopes for was the Crv. I drove it first. Didn’t care for the looks too much , wierd horizontal protruding taillights (vertical pillars are a crv classic, why change that?) as for the Subaru and the Toyota , I was really unimpressed. They were plain , bland and even felt kind of cheaply made. The brand new rav4 I drove even creaked like a 10 year old car does idk if I just got a bad one , but it sounded as if the interior was coming apart anytime I hit a bump on the road. No bueno. Finally after a week of test drives , I made my way to the Nissan dealer and stepped into a beautiful caspian blue Rogue SL and fell in love...This is a beautiful vehicle. The interior in very high end , soft touch durable surfaces that don’t look,sound or feel cheap at all. My niece owns a Lexus is250 (beautiful car) and my Rogues interior rivals or bests it. I have had people walk away stunned after riding in it with me . Comparing it to BMWs and a Benz in one case. Not only does it look great and is it beautifully aggressively designed, but it runs like a dream. Super comfortable and loaded with safety and technology . As for its acceleration , ok it could be a little stronger but the amazing gas mileage I am getting more than supercedes this minor issue. I have had no issues at all passing slugs in traffic or merging quickly onto a busy highway. I feel some gear heads think all vehicles have to perform like a Ferrari. For the person buying a family runaround vehicle for weekend road trips and grocery runs , the performance is perfect. As for the cvt , if you want a traditional transmission , then do your homework, there are plenty of options out there for you. I love the cvt. It performs better than most and this particular one works great for Nissan. Even somewhat mimics a traditional transmission for those that aren’t open to NEW technology, (crazy). Know what you are buying people!...All that said, I couldn’t be any happier. I LOVE my Rogue. Don’t be fooled by “professional” reviews. Drive it yourself be your own professional. I relate more to Consumer reviews as we are the ones driving and living with these vehicles on a daily basis. “PROs” step into a vehicle once for maybe 30 mins and seem to have ALL the( sometimes very Honda/Toyota biased ) answers. Trust me people there are better options out there. The Nissan Rogue...",5

Never in my wildest (worst) dreams would I buy this vehicle. Yes, it has a very comfortable ride over the highway for both driver and front passenger, but the wimpy weak little engine just couldn't get enough guts to pass much of anything on a highway hill. And on the many winding, S-curve, 2-lane country back roads we took were an exercise in terror thanks to the massive blind spot from the huge A pillar on the driver's side - couldn't see if there were cars coming toward me around any curves without craning my neck one way or another. And the handling....well, it was like driving a marshmallow. Sloppy, wishy-washy, imprecise, just plain unpleasant. I had no feel of the road whatsoever. Granted, at the time my primary car was an Acura TL Type-S, so perhaps not fair to compare, but it was 10 years older than this Rogue, so I feel there's no excuse. I ended up buying a 2018 Subaru Outback 3.6R Touring and it is almost as pleasing to drive as my beloved Acura. If you value handling, power/torque, as well as passenger comfort, RUN AWAY from the Rogue and give the Outback a try. (The other one to try would be a 2017 Infiniti QX50 - pretty amazing, but the Subaru 3.6R gives almost the same driving experience for a lot less money.)",2

I had the opportunity to drive the Rogue and, in today's competitive crowded SUV marketplace, the Rogue is simply outclassed by most of its rivals and for $20k, you have MUCH better options such as the RAV4.  The Rogue lacks some basic amenities such as bluetooth or a backup camera.  The powertrain, while meeting basic needs, is severely underpowered in today's turbo-charged world.  Nissan clearly hasn't been investing in the Rogue while America makes this the #2 selling vehicle in the US (YTD November 2017) - I feel bad for the 300k consumers who have purchased this vehicle because it lacks refinement, power, convenience and checks a single box which is ""SUV"".

694, on 12/05/17 07:39 AM (PST),William G ,2017 Nissan Rogue  SL 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Great SUV," First off, the interior of the Rogue looks more like a luxury SUV than a moderately priced one. Nissan did an exceptional job here. The ride comfort is extraordinary and at highway speeds there is basically no wind noise.  The only negatives for me - which are extremely minor - are: the switches to turn on the Sport and Eco modes, and the rest of these, are located in a place - lower left hand side of dashboard - which makes it difficult to see when driving.  The only other thing is the map graphics for the nav system are a little dated.  Other than that, I checked out a good number of SUVs in this general price segment (Honda, Toyota, Mazda and Subaru) and for y money, the Rogue blew the rest of them away.  The adjustable configurations for the shelves in the hatchback area are excellent.  Sometimes we carry things - like grocery bags - that are long and vertical and would have a difficult time staying vertical when driving. We just configure the back and put the shelves vertical into their holders and voila we have an area that will hold the bags tight and keep them up.  We can also put the shelves horizontal and double the storage spaces back there.   Fuel economy around time is not great - about 23 MPG - but highway in ECO mode we were getting 32-33 MPG easily.   Since we bought the Rogue in Sept 2017 we see ALOT of them on the road, so if you don't like that then buy something else but seeing so many just confirmed for me that this is the best small SUV out there right now....********** UPDATE *********It is now June 2018 and I have owned the Rogue for 9 months and it has a little more than 6k miles on it. I probably like it more today than when I wrote the original review ! Very well built automobile, the safety features are awesome. Went through the Connecticut winter without a care.  The only improvement I would make is to the NAV system.   The maps feel a little outdated  however the system works well. Overall I cannot recommend the Nissan Rogue enough !",5

I did extensive analysis comparing this with CX-5, CR-V & NX (My cars in the radar). I was very much drawn to the rougue due to its appearance and utility. I was a bit concerned about the inputs provided by some regarding the acceleration and CVT. After test driving all my comparisons decided to go with this as it was the most comfortable and appealing to me. It takes a bit getting used to the CVT and feels like there is a lack of response (especially I am coming off driving a BMW 328i for couple of years) but I feel that being mild the accelerator gets a more responsive torque and good enough for day to day driving. I am very comfortable now and love the way it handles the road imperfections. The smoothness of the ride is very good and I am very happy about the purchase and no second thoughts. I placing this feedback in case someone is looking for a user feedback and want to help people like me who had a lot to gain from others feedback.

Good gas mileage (Nissan claims it to be 33 on highways and 26 on city roads)2. Additional seat for occasional usage of my family needsEver since I bought this car I am getting very low gas mileage and tried to work with local dealer as well as Nissan for resolution but no satisfactory results-1. I am getting ~ 19 MPG in city driving and getting 24-26 MPG on highway driving which is about 8 MPG lower than what is claimed at the time vehicle is sold or advertised.2. Multiple visits to dealer and gave them gas mileage readings as per their requirements. Dealer did software upgrade but I don't see they did anything reasonable which convince that it should make it better. After multiple visits and fulfilling whatever they asked for (even waiting for more then 4-5 Hrs. in one occasion) no outcome and dealer asked me to call Nissan customer care.3. I called Nissan customer care and got Case opened but here also it was completely unsatisfactory4. Nissan representative told me that based on dealer checks, everything is working as expected and after lot of persuasion she agreed that her supervisor will call5. Supervisor called me and she told me the same story that as per dealer it is within company specifications. when asked what are company specifications and this is lower than what you advertise, no answer and keep on repeating that this is within company specifications. This was completely unacceptable and no help provided by Nissan and after I told that I have to go to Better Business Bureau, she had no effect. Seems Nissan is very proud of their legal team and a mere customer can't do anything against them. So if you are buying any Nissan vehicle and you are unlucky to get a bad vehicle, my experience is that both Dealer and Nissan will leave you to deal with it.I would recommend to not go with Nissan or Cherry Hill Nissan dealership.",1
705, on 08/26/17 14:09 PM (PDT),DW ,2017 Nissan Rogue  SV 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Buyer beware," I like many took the vehicle (2017 Nissan Rouge SV cloth interior with drive side powered seat) out for a short test drive and I liked how it drove. At the time of this review (Note:I bought my vehicle on 5/18/2017 and today is 8/26/2017).  The vehicle front drivers seat ( Cloth Material power) is now putting pressure on the back of my legs causing quite of bit of discomfort/pain ( that is putting it nicely). I have tried adjusting the seat several times, In every different position it will allow me to. I have had no success in releaving my discomfort. It was suggested that I place a pillow behind me to move me forward in the seat. Yes that took the presure point off that part of my legs and now placed unto another part of my legs. Now I have taken drastic measure, I have purchased a memory foam car pillow and placed under my butt/legs in order to lift my legs away from the front of the driver seat, that is where it seems the culprit of my problem is. At the end of the seat it has a slight up swing and the foam padding has no give to it. That is what's is causing the seat to dig into the back of my legs causing me pain. I have contacted Nissan and I also went back to where I purchased it. The service dept. looked me straight in my face and said didn't you take it for a test ride before you bought. I replied yes then they said did you feel any problem on your test drive I replayed no. Their answer to me was that is how the seat is made and there isn't a thing they can do for me. I called Nissan's customer service in Tenn. The nicely spoken female on the other end of the line was from Nisan consumer reports in Tenn. She stated to me that she is not a technician and has to go on what the Mechanics at the dealership recommends. She also stated that they take all consumers reports and pass them onto the appropriate team so they can possibly improve on the vehicle. What baffles my imagination is that no one from the dealership did any research. Like take my vehicle out for a test ride to see maybe I had a defective seat or to even go look at another cars seat to compare the two. It was an immediate that is how the seat is made and there is nothing we can do. One person at the service dept. recommended I might want to find a custom reholpster maybe they can help me with my problem, but they had no one to recommend. I did my research on the reholpster and found one willing to try to help me relieve the pressure point in the seat. I was in so much discomfort that I was willing to try anything to release it. I did and it has relieve some of the problem I was having. Now at least I can drive the vehicle. So the out come of this is Basically I should have caught the problem at the test drive now I am S.O.L. I was on my own to find a solution to it. So now after my little rant I would have to say No the front Driver Seat of my 2017  Rogue is not comfortable. I have done a little more research regarding this vehicle. Their leather interior driver powered seat seems to have an added adjustment. It looks like it has a foward and backward tilt. If the cloth seat had that feature it would most likely corrected my problem. But if you buy or want leather you have to deal with all the other Bells and whistles ( which I did not want ) they shove down the consumer throat and it is not cheap. Those sticker prices of those vehicles ranged some where in the low to upper 30k. Good luck with your purchase hopefully you will have a better experience then I did singed A Unhappy Consumer. I finaly brought the car into a custom reholpster they took out the stiffness in the front of the seat replaced it with memory foam. That was a costly fix for me. After I did that I finaly got a call from the mgr of my local Nissan. he was sympathic to my problem and wanted to know what could be done for me, I explained what I did and how muc it cost me. The Mgr payed half the cost of the possible fix to my problem. I drove the car for a few days and still after all that I still felt uncomfortable. I finaly tried several memory foam pillows to sit on. I have now choosen one of them and have been sitting on it ever since. ( My friends wfe makes fun of my cushion she calls it my booster seat) It is now toerable to drive but still uncomfortable.  If I could I would trade the car in to car max and purchase a different vehicle from a different manufacture but it is not in my budgetting at the moment. Hate to say it but this was my First  purchase of a Nissan Vehicle and probably is my last time buying a Nissan too..  Today’s date is Sept. 6  2018 Nothing has changed since my last posting on here.

Fuel Economy is marginal even in econ mode. The rear cargo area has protrusions for the shelf system. When you use the shelf it is great. When you are loading a large object it prevents it from fitting into the space.If the key is in your pocket with a cell phone the auto door lock will not work and the car can't see the key and it will not start. The blue tooth is spotty and is very slow to react to the controls on the steering wheel.On the highway it is a great car. Very comfortable and fairly quiet. The droning of the engine pulses is still very prominent at low speeds. The steering wheel vibrates and is very annoying.When you test drive this car please make sure you find a long test drive route where you can maintain 1,500 RPM. The CVT transmission causes a harmonic vibration in regular mode. It is caused by moving into the highest gear possible, as quickly as possible to obtain the best fuel economy. You are no doubt asking how does this guy know this. Well I bought a new Rogue in July and have a vibration in my steering wheel at 1,500 RPM. I took it back and the the dealer said nothing could be done. I called Nissan and they said they are aware and nothing could be done. The dealer got me in touch with the regional technical service representative. He rode in the vehicle and said this is what you have. Once again nothing can be done. If a fix becomes available we will let you know. This is a feature on all Rogues and you should have felt it when you test drove the car.",4

Wasn't expecting it to be my favorite test drive, but it was.  Rides great, quiet on the road, feels very solid, connected with the road, and upscale.  Gas mileage rating is spot on.  After 4000 miles I'm averaging exactly the rated 27 combined mpg and I drive combined city and highway.  Actually about 1 mpg better than my previous midsize car was so I'm not complaining for an AWD SUV.  The CVT also turned out to be better than expected.  Easily and seamlessly compensates for hills on the interstate without hunting for gears - just finds it sweet spot on rpm's.   Transmission can be a little slow to respond at times but has no trouble getting up to,speed if you give it a little extra gas when called for.  Reviewer says it's slow, but a 0-60 time of 8.6 is hardly lethargic for the class of vehicle and given that it's just a 4 cylinder engine and it's class leading gas mileage, I have no issues with the performance.   Sun and Sound package on the SV model is great.  Instrumentation and technology also very nice.  Plenty of room for passengers and versitile cargo arrangement capabilities.  Overall, an excellent vehicle.  I have no regrets purchasing it and would do so again today.",5

End 04/17 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl CVT),2017 nissan rogue s black very nice suv," I traded my 2015 altima s for the 2017 rogue s with the 3rd row seats family package it comes with the run flat tires,     and nissan dropped the 3rd seat for 2018 its no longer available glad i got it when i did this is definitaly my last new vehicle.the rogue is only one of 2 in class vehicles that offer a 3rd row seat.  I got magnetic black metallic with black interior.   I did not want to buy any more new cars but could use the room for my family so I decided to buy one last new vehicle that has more room and cargo versatility . The rogue s comes with all the features you need power accessories, keyless entry, alarm, camera,bluetooth streaming,satellite rado,CD player,cruise control, and it also has active ride control, active trace control,active engine brake,tire pressure monitoring with tire pressures display.  And easy fill tire alert thinks when you have right amount of air in tire,The interior is very nice soft touch materials,  And it also has a eco and sport driving mode, eco is for better fuel economy. Its very roomy and very good gas mileage it gets about same fuel economy as altima. One of my average fuel economy's is 26.3 but the current is always different I have gotten up to 37.6 but haven't been on interstate out of state  yet i expect to get in 30s.   . Got a 3.9 interest rate so the loan I will get paid pretty quick ,gonna pay ahead extra and get it paid off earlier. Update, still Loving my rogue there isn't anything that I don't like about it, it gets good gas mileage,there is fuel economy 1 and 2 the first one says average of 27 and the other changes every time you drive and turn it off and it has gotten up to 41 miles a gallon on economy 2. and it's the base model it has all the features i need but mine don't have all the extra technology features like emergency braking and other stuff, I don't want that extra technology in mine it just stuff that be expensive to fix later, the base model has the regular key and my rogue is rare it has the 3rd row seats which they are not making anymore",5

712, on 07/17/17 07:12 AM (PDT),Linda ,2017 Nissan Rogue  SV 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl CVT),I really wanted to love it, Ok The absolute truth here. I rent cars by the month for the past year. I have driven many different cars. I loved the Nissan Altima but prefer an SUV so I assumed the Rouge would be the comfort of the Altima in an SUV. I now have the Rouge SV model and I have to say the difference is night and day and not in a good way.  The Altima I had was the SL model with leather trip and those zero gravity seats. The Rouge is not leather and the seats are terrible. I don't mind cloth seats but these seats are weird and I cant get the driver seat adjusted properly.  I do not get where all the great comfort reviews come from. This seat is small and not supportive at all. The worst part is I cant reach the top of the steering wheel. If I move the seat forward my right knee is in the dash. It is a very uncomfortable drive. I have to drive 10 hours in this thing. So my reason for the review is to just warn those considering this vehicle. Go sit in it. Test drive it. Comfort is relative to each individual. I had very high hopes for the Rouge and maybe the SL model would fix the issues I am having but I cant request that in a rental pool.,2

We just wanted a new car with better gas mileage. The Murano was the best car we have ever owned. No complaints at all really, but our new rogue surprises me all the time with it's performance and quality. Took me a long time to realize that I don't need a V 6.  I keep hearing that the Rouge is under powered and doesn't handle well compared to some of it's competition. Could have fooled me! I don't feel that way at all.  Love it on the road and love it in town. We have the high end of the rogue line and the safety features are really a welcome addition to our daily driving. All the safety features of a more prestigious and much more expensive SUV, and we love the Monarch Orange color we choose, and the leather interior. After 9 mo. it's still a joy to drive. Couldn't be happier! It is now May 2018 and I was asked to update my review, and I wouldn't change one comment in my review. It is fully loaded, so it has all the bells and whistles, and most people I don't think pay for that, so it's a platinum Rogue. Love it as much as the day we bought it!",5
719, on 04/19/17 09:55 AM (PDT),Hector ,2017 Nissan Rogue  SL w/Prod. End 04/17 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Luxury SUV in Disguise," Our 2017 Nissan Rogue SL AWD w/Platinum Reserve Package is, by far, the best car we've ever owned - and definitely deserves a much higher, Edmunds rating than just 3 stars.  The Rogue exudes quality and truly feels like a luxury car in disguise - and like it should cost a LOT more than it does.  We constantly get compliments from people around us who either just see it (it's black with beautiful, silver/black, 19"" allow rims, and the tan/camel colored, leather interior) or ride in it.  When people do ride in it, they come away supremely impressed and express interest in getting one - every single person who rides in it tells us they want the car...every-single-person...no exaggeration.  And, as owners, we continue to be supremely impressed with it.  There's a reason sales of the Rogue are exploding.  It's a great SUV!  I really don't understand all the adoration the CR-V gets.  For us, the Rogue is hands-down better.  It's more comfortable, more soothing to drive, better-looking, just as roomy and spacious, and has a more flexible cargo system - not to mention having MUCH more comfortable seats and a smoother ride.  Plus, Nissan always works with you to get a good deal, unlike Honda.  I admit that the Rogue could be a bit faster, but it's definitely not objectionable, in the least - and it gets up to speed on the highway just fine (in fact, many people ask if it has V6 since it gets up to speed so nicely).  The Rogue's naturally-aspirated, 2.5-liter engine is a reliable workhorse that's been around for years, and it gets-the-job-done - and all with a pleasant, masculine growl when you lay into it (which sounds better than the CR-V's clatter-y, small displacement, direct-injected and tacked-on turbo sound).  Also, the CVT now features ""steps"" to make it feel more like a regular automatic with much less ""drone"" - if that's important to you.  Personally, I prefer CVT's over regular automatics - Why would you need to feel gear shifts in an automatic transmission, anyway?  If you want to feel gear shifts, get a manual. (And, it seems as though the auto industry agrees as it's following Nissan's footsteps, with Subaru, Honda, Toyota and others all following suit and making their own CVTs, which Nissan started doing over a decade ago!)  It's interesting how Edmunds calls the Toyota RAV4's acceleration ""average for the class,"" yet calls the Rogue's ""slow for the class"" even though, literally, only 0.1 milliseconds differentiate the two.  0.1 milliseconds?  As a human, can you possibly even feel that?  Biased much, Edmunds?  The Rogue, also, handles very confidently.  Does it ""feel"" as ""sporty"" as the CX-5 or Escape?  Maybe not.  The only dynamic trait I take issue with is that the steering is too light (but, if you hit the ""Sport"" button, it tightens it up).  However, does a car need to ""feel sporty"" in order to be considered good?  Is it no longer a good-enough car simply cuz it doesn't ""feel sporty?""  Do family cars and SUVs/Crossovers need to feel ""sporty,"" anyway?  And how about smoothness and comfort?  Does that ever take precedence over feeling ""sporty?""  Sometimes, automotive journalists are too jaded.  They want everything to handle like a sports car.  The fact of the matter is that the Rogue does handle well and securely, it instills confidence and it's perfectly safe, especially for an SUV/Crossover.  Interestingly, and you can check it out yourselves, the handling/performance numbers between ALL the competitors are SO similar to each other that it really makes you wonder.  (Things that make you go: ""Hmmm."")In addition, the Rogue is, actually, a very good off-roader that performs awesomely in the snow!  It's AWD system is so good that it only trails behind stalwart AWD systems from Jeep and Subaru.  There is nary a mention of AWD performance in all these crossover reviews, here, which all feature AWD.  How is AWD performance not an important feature to report on?  Hello, Edmunds!  The Rogue's AWD system is superior to the Honda CRV's outright useless system, the RAV4's, the CX-5's and the Escape's.  The Rogue TRULY is a great SUV, and you'd do yourselves a disservice by automatically and/or blindly going for a Honda, Toyota or Ford, etc. without checking one out, driving it and forming your OWN opinion - as opposed to letting yourselves be influenced by paid-off, biased, CVT-hating automotive journalists (who have hidden agendas).  Check the out the Rogue...you'll thank me and the other hundreds of thousands of satisfied owners for it. ;)",5

It has the rear camera and adjustable mirrors, but I am not comfortable with the view when I turn around to see behind me - another thing to get used to using.  The interior design is good, and it's comfortable for everyone in the car.  It even has AC in the back seat - my dog loves that option.  I added leather seats for easier fur cleanup and the front seats are heated.  I had it Simonized inside and out, which is well worth the price.",4

I had finally decided on the Nissan Rogue and I have never been happier!  The 2 key factors I wanted most was plenty of back seat space and great gas mileage and my 2016 Rogue fits the bill on both!  I am a 6' tall and i have plenty of head room and decent leg room and the back seat room is huge and the back seats even recline.  Even the base model I drive has an elegant looking interior.  It handles great on the road and rides very smooth!  The miles per gallon on this SUV is amazing!  Probably my most favorite feature is the 'eco button' located left of the steering wheel.  This setting allows your vehicle to achieve the best gas mileage possible.  I commute 30 miles back and forth to work 5 days a week and and I go 7 days before having to refill my tank.  I have no complaints at all with My Rogue and I have not experienced the popping sounds some reviewers complained about coming from the wheels when i make turns.

The Rogue was by far the most comfortable and quiet.  If you're someone that isn't concerned about 0 to 60 in 4 seconds and is looking for a vehicle that is fun to drive, comfortable, roomy and loaded with tech...this is your pick!  The Rogue has the best tech features.  the 7 inch display is nice at the SV level.  Be sure to go with the Premium package and you get the best bang for your buck.  You don't get the adjusting cruise control and lane assist (that's only on the SL) but you do get Blind Side Warning and full navigation.  I'm almost 2 months into driving this and I'm still excited every time I get in.  It handles excellent in the snow and the ambient sound in the cabin is almost non existent.  I usually drive this in ECO mode and have been getting about 27 MPG which is lower than advertised but I feel as though that is always the case.  I've been getting about 30 on the highway.

The HID lighting is excellent, the heated seats are nice and comfortable, and cloth, which we prefer. The sound system upgrade with 9 Bose speakers, 2 being subs, and the ginormous panoramic moon-roof, really opens up the interior, and adds to the ambiance. Speaking of which, the foot-wells in front light up and can change color to suit your taste/preference, as do the doorsills ( only the 1 color there ). It is not a hot rod, nor was it meant to be, and unless hammering on it, the cvt is not that intrusive, and makes up for it in mpg. I've had no issues passing or merging, and off the line, to 30 mph, it's time is nearly identical to the 6 cyl. Murano, and about a second slower to 60. Ride itself is decent all around, as is the handling. Remote start a plus, in heat or cold conditions. Happy so far, but not a lot of miles on yet. This particular model is like an SV 1/2, or between the standard SV and SL, with a couple options even the base SL does not have. Price was way better than the new CRV, and even the Rav and Forester, comparably equipped, of course. It is a car you should consider, test drive, and compare side by side ( charts ) if you are in the market. Yes, we got the helmet and badges/emblems also.",5

Before I bought my 2017 Rogue SV AWD, I was driving a 2012 GMC Terrain (just so you understand where I'm coming from).  The Terrain was a solid but unspectacular vehicle, and I really did not want to venture too far from that size of a vehicle.  It gave me just enough trunk space for my German Shepherd, and enough back seat space for kids and adults alike, even those who are vertically gifted.  I read a lot about the Rogue not having much power or pickup, and how the steering is sluggish.  I also came across reviews where people said the sight lines are poor or they had trouble seeing.  I've come to believe that these people were trolls from another car company!  I've had my Rogue for two weeks now and I'm extremely impressed.  It has all the space I need, it has fantastic torque off the line - so I can pass people when I need to - and I have not had any issues with vision or seeing out of the vehicle.  The interior is luxurious, and it almost feels like you're sitting in a Lexus.  I bought an SV AWD with the premium sound package and moon roof package.  Honestly, I could probably do without both of them, but they're nice to have.  The vehicle itself is fantastic and I want to encourage everyone to at least test drive one!  I think you'll be as impressed as I was.  And I hope my review helps, there weren't many about the 17 Rogues so I want to make sure I get the good word out!",5

End 04/17 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Happy with my purchase," I test drove the HR-V, Rav4, Forester, Tuscon, and CX-5 before choosing the Nissan Rogue. I purchased the SL w/ Platinum Package. The deciding factor was the intelligent cruise control feature with 0mpg stop & go. This feature is a life changer in big city stop & go traffic. Of the vehicles I test-drove, the forester was the only other vehicle with this feature. The Rav4, and CX-5 had a version of it, but it disabled below 20mph, and the Tuscon & HR-V didn't offer it at all. Overall I am very happy with the quality of my Rogue. The interior seems high-end and comfortable, way more so than the Forester.  Nissan needs to look closer at the Owners Manual because the ""how to"" on the Lane Departure Warning, Lane Departure Prevention, and the Blind-Spot monitoring System doesn't match up with how it actually works in the car, which has caused me some frustrations. Memory seats, heated steering wheel, Siri-Hands-free are some of my favorite features, as well as the remote control start.  The navigation system is ok, not terrible, but like most car navigation systems, it's not great with traffic and requires a few too many ""clicks"" to get what you need. I traded to the Rogue from an Acura RDX, and so far the Rogue seems on par with the quality I was used to.. The only downside is it's a bit more sluggish than I'd like.",5

The first time I take the vehicle back to the dealer they tell me it's a known problem and they are waiting on Nissan USA for a technical bulletin. Fast forward to today, I've got around 25K miles and have had my suspension fixed 3 times for the same popping noise. The vehicle has a hard idle and the headlines vibrate, which is unpleasant to watch while you are sitting in traffic. I wish that I had never purchased this vehicle and seriously considering dumping it before the factory warranty has expired.",1
743, on 11/12/17 11:09 AM (PST),christine mcgee ,2016 Nissan Rogue  S 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),What did they do to my Rogue?," This was not my first Rogue.  I previously leased a 2013 Rogue which I was But the worst in love with.  It was a high quality solid suv.  The seats were comfortable and the size was just perfect for me.  I never had a single problem, but in all fairness the mileage on the 2013 was not as good as the 2016.  When I turned it in at the end of the lease it only had 12,000 miles on it because i had 2 major surgeries that left my Rogue sitting in the driveway over winter for about 8 weeks one time and 4 weeks the second time.  I was ve surgury tempted to buy it but instead I let the salesman talk me into leasing the ""all new"" redesigned Rogue.  Biggest mistake of my life.  It was larger but felt bulky to me with those flared out fenders and the drivers headrest still bothers me as far as my comfort goes.  But the worst  is yet to come.  I leased in spring so I really didn't need the heater.  The first time I did It didn't work.  A freezing cold day and no heat!  I drove immediately to the dealership and cancelled my appointment I had been headed to.  They replaced whatever part it was and said this has been happenning to some Rogues.  Not what I wanted to hear.  Then another glitch in the summer.  the passanger window refused to go back up.  I had to physically force it by pushing on the window button and yanking upwards inch by inch.  Of course when I took it to the dealers it magically didn't do it, it worked just fine for them.   Now my biggest complaint.  I had knee replacement  surgery in January and the Rogue sat in the driveway for 3 weeks.  I got into my vehicle for the first time after my surgery to go to physical therapy and when I put it in reverse to pull out of my driveway I heard a very loud thump.  As I continued to drive it continued to thump loudly, but I could not cancel my appointment this time  and it was close to my house.  As I drove home the thump got quieter , I looked under the car when I got home to see if something was caught under there or maybe it was ice build up.  I am an older woman and know nothing about cars.  I waited a couple days because I had to work then took it to the dealership on my first day off.  Now here comes the shocker.   They told me the rear brakes were completely rusted out and had to be replaced which warranty does NOT cover.  I was really upset and argued the Rogue is only a year old, less than 10,000 miles, this never happenned to my 2013 which sat for months and had even less mileage, etc.  In general I made a scene.  The sevicewoman said I can show you your rusted out brakes, you don't drive enough, parts are made cheaper now, they put something in the road salt this year, she had every excuse in the book.  I am not a total dummy, if any of that were true, most lf the cars sitting in their lot would have rusted out brakes too, and loudly stated why would I ever want to lease a Nissan anything ever again.  Every customer waiting for their car to be serviced heard me,  Then my salesman appeared and began to give me the same speach starting with you don't drive it enough.  If that was a problem older people everywhere would be replacing their brakes.  He finally realized how upset I was and went into the service managers office.   They agreed to fix the brakes using ""courtesy"" funds from the Burdick dealership.  I waited 2 hours for the repair all the while my stomach was churning.  The salesman came out when it was finished and very kindly told me if it happenned again I would have to pay as they couldn't do this again and to drive more often which I do because my granddaughter lives in Pulaski NY  a 70 mile round trip every weekend.  I believe he knew in his heart this was a flaw in Nissan parts, not in my lack of driving.  I am considering a differnt make of SUV when my lease is up.. I really believe the quality of the Nissan Rogue and all Nissans has gone downhill in an attempt to save money they are using cheaper parts.  I wish I had bought out my 2013.",3

I kinda wished I had a backup camera on it. So when the last of the 2016 line came out and I saw the deals being offered I knew it was time to trade up. The SV trim had everything I wanted and more. Bluetooth, Backup camera, even more storage capability than in the previous generation Rogue. I'm pleasantly impressed with the new electronics, individual air presssure tire sensors and the moveable and tilt back seats. My friends like e drink holder! I'm most impressed with the quiet ride and the brighter headlights.  I've owned  2004 and 2006 Altima S as well as the 2012 Rogue S and I'm very familiar and happy with the 2.5 L engine that all those cars had. It's plenty peppy for highway and city driving. I know I can put 100,000 plus miles easy on it without a problem. If I needed a bigger engine I would just get a Pathfinder or Murano. The AWD on the 2012 never failed me in the WV winters. I expect this Compact SUV to perform in the winter weather just as well. I don't need to tow a trailer and I could care less about doing burnouts these days.  If you are such a gear head that you want to feel a transmittion that shifts from every gear, then maybe a CVT isn't for you. Give me the higher gas mileage and comfortable ride. The NASA inspired driver's seat with the lunar support and electronic positioning is awesome. I'm a satisfied Nissan owner.",5

I got a great deal, saved thousands. I have bern very happy with the mileage in ECO mode, the 2 highest on the highway being 39.7 and 43.9 mpg on 87 octane gas and it only has 4400 miles. The size is just right and the zero gravity seats are so much more comfortable than my previous Jeep. And no initial or any issues at all (unlike the new Jeep  Renegade, which had me at the dealer every other week and had the most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced). The handling, acceleration, CVT and visibility are great for me and there is nothing that would prevent me from buying this car again.

I brought the Rogue brand new off the lot and like others experienced the vibrating and the knocking. Within the first 3-6 months of having the car they replaced the alternator, struts, strut mounts and eventually the entire front end suspension system. After all of that the vibrating and knocking noise was still there. I'm currently looking for a new vehicle now, either a Toyota or Honda. This is my second bad experience with Nissan I owned a 2006 Nissan Pathfinder that was apart of the bad redesign of the transmission and radiator. Thought I would give Nissan a try again after 10 years and that was a mistake. They were really good cars at one point, but that is not the case anymore.

It's the best handling suv/crossover I've driven. It truly felt like a sport sedan. I have never been a fan of Nissan's CVT but on this vehicle it's fantastic; though the car itself feels under-powered with the 4-cylinder under hard acceleration, it is on par with its competitors. The power you give up for fuel mileage is absolutely worth it. I drove all over southern California from LA traffic to the mountains of Yosemite, and averaged just over 30 mpg. This is AMAZING for a 'spirited' driver like myself. I even managed 40 mpg on a 150 mile stretch driving conservatively. The handling and fuel mileage were absolutely enough to consider buying this car. The only major issue was how uncomfortable the seats were. Very stiff and not supportive (no lumbar adjustment!?), which led to back pain flaring up. When I sat in my own car the day after returning from my trip it was the biggest relief. Fantastic value especially if you find a low mileage used one, but not for me.",4

Found a broken wire on the purge valve connnector. After 2 days, went back to dealer as they had not contacted me on doing the repair. The dealer wanted $1,700.00 to fix a broken wire on this connector. Said the whole wire harness had to be replaced. (For real) they said it was a comon problem. Nissan never mentioned the TSB, but it is a Technical service bulletin, advising this can happen. Fyi.... local garage, Kilgore Automotive, fixed my broken wire on my Nissan.  Cost.... $65.00 There is a TSB (technical Service Bulletin) out from Nissan, on this very same problem, as it is a known existing problem! Yet, Patterson Nissan of Longview either does not know about it, or they are trying to stick it to customers, to get this corrected. There is a ""pig tail"" available online, to fix this too. It is about $140.00, installed!  Wonder why Patterson could not do that, as well!!!  BEWARE of Patterson Nissan is either not aware of this, or were trying to screw me. Jury is out on that. Also, on the CVT TRANSMISSION, Nissan says if you use any replaement fluid, rather than their iwn, it will void the warranty. Their fluid is two to three times the price of other fluids... beware!",3

Trouble from get go. Struts and suspension were bad from two weeks into it. Had to drive 6 hours RT twice through sleet and snow to get it fixed. Bad paint job...the traveling really messed it up. They replaced front struts and springs, which did work but who is to know if the problem would come back. Told me that the factories buy the parts from different companies and some are bad and some good. They left grease  and some kind of oil all over front end and doors. When I took it to be detailed, they thought that it was a used car. By the time that it was fixed, I was so tired of the blah drive and cheap materials used to build the car inside and out, that I finally traded it in for a  Mazda CX-5 GT with tech and activesense. Painful, but worth it. No comparison in performance and quality and appearance. The Nissan forward emergency brakes are a joke. I do very much miss the birds eye view camera and the power rear door, but everything else makes up for it. I do not like that Nissan wants you to pay for their Nissan Connect, when Mazda includes the features in the vehicle for the one time price of car. The Rogues cheap looking leather doesn't even wrap around the inner sides of the seat. The drivers seat made me limp every time I got out of the car. The lights are awful when you go downhill. The steering is awful. I could never relax on winding roads, instead of natural mindless steering on a decent vehicle. The Nissan actually had a difficult time going over the little bump to enter my garage....I had to very carefully gas it a little to enter.  I am pretty sure that the MPG that the car showed on the screen were not true at all, because I was constantly filling it up, whereas the Mazda shows the same good mileage, but the tank remains fairly full for a long time. The Mazda gas tank holds less than a gallon more than the Nissan, but not enough to make such a considerable difference. Nissan needs to build better cars, instead of trying, unsuccessfully, to add fun frills. Imagine, it had to be a pretty bad experience to do such a drastic thing .... taking such a loss trading in a brand new vehicle.",2

767, on 01/15/17 09:53 AM (PST),Shelly ,2016 Nissan Rogue  SL 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl CVT),hopefully I didn't buy a lemon," My SUV had less than 1,000 miles, it started making a ""popping sound"" when turning at low speeds.  I called dealership, they stated they were aware it is occurring with other 2016 Rogues. They stated the SUV was still safe to drive and to come back when it's time for first oil change since they were still working on solution to fix it.  I now have 3,00 miles, and the sounds are VERY loud now.  It is annoying. My car does not handle well either.  I am calling the dealership back today.  For buying a brand new car, I do not think this is acceptable. What else is going to break so soon?  I'm getting 23 average mile per gallon, and this is on the highway too. I've been driving very carefully to see if the miles per gallon will get better, however, it doesn't.  I've had others drive my car to see if it changes, and it doesn't. The center console, in my opinion, is centered too far back.  It makes it difficult to get things in and out of it.  The leather was already puckering up on the back seats within 2,000 miles.  I think these were cheaply made. I'm sorry I bought this SUV.   Also, do not rely on the navigation, as it's led me straight into horrible traffic, google maps is much better providing alternate routes.I ended up trading this car in after 1 year. Do not recommend. I wasted so much time bringing this to the dealership for repairs with no result. It’s too bad I bought a brand new car, yet had to take off numerous PTO days from work to bring it to the dealership. They did not perform the work on Saturdays, so weekdays were the only option. You would think they would at least give me a loaner for all of the inconvenience. They didn’t though.",1

My wife loved the Rogue. Then a chirp,chirp,chirp,chirp noise started at 63 mph especially when decelerating. No noise above 68. About 15000 miles now and noise is louder. Contacted dealer.(very good dealer) Road tested with their technician. He hears the noise. They replaced the front wheel bearings which they found to be noisy. NO CHANGE. Technician took new Rogue off of lot, drove, it had same noise as mine at same speeds.Gave me 1-800-nissan-1 number to call. Back and forth with friendly  Nissan factory reps. They will investigate and get back. They did. One week goes by. Met with factory rep at dealer. Went for a ride in my car. Same noise. Went for ride in new Rogue off lot.  Same noise. Rep says this is ""inherent in the design of the car, cannot be fixed"". I think this is a brush off by the factory for a known defect of this vehicle. Except for this the car rides harshly but has a great interior. NO MORE NISSAN. They (factory) know about this problem but it will take re-engineering to fix. Cheaper to stone wall the owners. Think about it. The manufacturer tells you they cannot repair your car? It is all about money. Nissan is apparently aware that there are several thousand just like this out there and it must be a frequency associated with a major component that would be expensive to replace. These vehicles are built in Korea and the US. Mine is Korean built. Look on inside of drivers door for information. This is a safety issue due to driver distraction. Vehicle has just over 23000 miles now and still makes same noise at a wider range of speeds. Never again. Fifty eight to sixty eight mph. The US built version may not do this.",2

772, on 12/30/16 04:56 AM (PST),Ashley ,2016 Nissan Rogue  SV 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Rogue Rip-Off," In January 2016 I traded in my 2008 Rogue on a brand new 2016 Rogue.  My 2008 Rogue has 112,000 miles on it.  It had just rolled over to 100,000 miles and the transmission had to be replaced.  Luckily it was covered under warranty.  Nissan was having so many problems with the transmissions they extended the warranty so I got lucky.  12,000 miles and 14 months later the transmission went out again and had to be replaced.  Again, this was covered under warranty, however this transmission was only warranted for a year.  I didn't want to take a risk so I decided to trade the car on a new Rogue.  I was told how much better the new CVT transmission is than the old transmission.  Well the 2016 Rogue that I have had for 11 months and has 12,700 miles on it is now having the transmission replaced.  I went to the sales department because I want to trade the piece of junk and they will only give me $16,000 for it which is ridiculous.  The fact that I was even willing to buy another Nissan should have shown my loyalty to them and you would think they would take that into consideration when considering my trade.  I will never buy another Nissan and cannot wait until I can get rid of the one that I have.  On a positive note the service department at the dealership that I go to is wonderful.  The service advisors are great and they make sure I am taken care of with a loaner vehicle while my car is being worked on.  It's disappointing that Nissan continues to put out a poor product.

Few issues that I have about the car is: noisy tranny, really slow (compared to a 1999 Honda Accord 2.3l V4 150hp), navigation system freezes or doesn't work at all once in a while, recently the car wouldn't recognize the key even though it is in the vehicle, really huge a-pillars, not that many choices for audio and entertainment system. Few things that I like that other companies doesn't offer (ex.: Honda): Surround View 360 degree montior system, a volume and tune nob, Bose audio system, the divide and hide system. I really wish Nissan would increase the number of audio apps that it would support and would like to fix up the navigation issue.",4
775, on 12/19/16 09:33 AM (PST),Arkady Pishik ,2016 Nissan Rogue  SV 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Unbelievable customer service and pricing!!!," I had a great experience at Fontana Nissan. The sales representative Mikhail was very knowledgeable and very understanding of my needs. I previously owned a Mercedes Benz, and using my vehicle only for daily driving, I decided to downsize. Mikhail presented the vehicle to me like I was still in my Mercedes, and felt very comfortable with my purchase. I have never experienced such a positive environment at a dealership before, from the salesman to the managers. The car was perfect for what I needed it for, and had all the options and features that I was looking for in a daily driver. Many thanks again to Mikhail and Fontana Nissan for such a great time, and great deal. I will truly recommend all my family and friends to this dealership!!",5
776, on 12/12/16 23:46 PM (PST),Chet Heath ,2016 Nissan Rogue  S 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl CVT),"Not flashy, but still a good value at 6 months"," Nissan gave me the best price as a year-end leftover with $3500 of incentives and the Rogue is a good value for the money. The Mazda CX-5 was the most fun to drive, but the Rogue felt more solid. It seems a lot bigger inside. The Hundai SantaFe compares well, had much better visibility, but their pricing was poor. The Rogue was the easiest for a big man to get in and out of - the Honda was the worst. I like the Rogue's flexible storage and even made additional panels.  The seats are comfortable for a big man. My particular Rogue was made entirely in Japan (VIN starts with a ""J"") and I am expecting higher build quality without North American union labor. On the low end ""S"" model, the appearance option is money well spent; the tinted windows alone justify it.  On the downside: The visibility is poor; both of the rear side windows are tiny and the front window pillars, and mirrors dangerously block view of pedestrians leaving the curb on either side - especially for shorter drivers. A 180 degree front view camera might help. One saving grace is that the rear window seems to be a bit larger than competition, but the rear seat headrests need to be removed to take advantage of it. The entry level remote control key system that comes with the ""S"" model will let you lock yourself out of the car; have a key cut by a locksmith ($4) that can only open the door, and hide it for this situation. At least it will let you lock your wife's purse inside the car, when she doesn't want to carry it - the high end remote control key system will not lock with her key inside her purse. Another minor negative is that the radio is biased heavily in favor of Apple connectivity and the designers simply forgot that Android phones exist. Further in this vein: A USB stick with music is a common media element in all the brands, but Nissan seems to have limited the radio's ability to read one to 16GB - there is no discussion of it in the documentation and the Dealer does not know anything about it. The 3-year warranty seems short, but the dealer had a way to extend it to 6 years & 72 months for 16 dollars per month. Another, feature worth giving up one Starbucks per week is the XM radio. Absolutely addictive - but their plans are limited. You can't order channels ""a la carte"" on a vehicle radio and they don't offer a plan with just music and news - you have to take (pricey) sports and/or other channels that you don't want. Lastly, I wish the advanced safety options were available on all the levels - in reality, they cost thousands more than the listed option cost - just to get to a level where they are available.  Overall, my wife and family feel safe in this car, but my wife is less eager to drive it with the blind spots.- Update: Still, the absolute worst feature of the car is that you can lock yourself out of it easily. The low end keyless system allows you to close the door with the keys inside and does not warn you. If you then set the lock from the armrest (by habit), you can lock yourself out. As stated earlier, to fix this, I got a spare key, that will only open the door, and put it in my wallet. It won't start the car, but it will open it. Visibility is marginal: I added a 3"" square convex mirror to the driver's side, and weatherproof 170 degree TV cameras on the passenger side and directly forward to resolve blind spots. The camera in the front allows accurate close parking up to a wall, or another vehicle. The pattern of the LED driving lights (only as viewed by the camera inside the front logo) conveniently changes as it gets within a minimum distance. The passenger side camera mounts under the right side mirror housing and the 7"" led monitor fits perfectly below radio in the coin tray area. I made a fiberboard enclosure for it and it looks like it belongs there. All the parts were available from China through eBay for less than $50. The rear floor carpet has Rogue logo covers glued loosely to the carpet; they do this because the same car is sold under different names outside the US. These covers come off as soon as something heavy is rolled into the back. Unlike previous Nissans, the 12 volt receptacles all shut down about a minute after the car is shut off. This makes it pointless to try to charge a cellphone in the car overnight. I added a set of fused 12 volt outlet receptacles (connected to the battery directly) for $15 (eBay again). Also missing is a way for short women, like my wife, to pull down the rear hatch. I added a simple strap.  Don't they have short women in Japan? The horn also failed - but there are two of them. I assume Nissan will fix that at the 5000 mile oil-change. And the XM radio for the S package has a tiny station selector knob and it is difficult to resolve the nearly 300 stations without the manual dexterity of a safecracker. Overall, the car is still a good value, and it is only a few little omissions and annoyances that detract from what is otherwise a very flexible and affordable vehicle.",4
777, on 12/05/16 15:35 PM (PST),amb ,2016 Nissan Rogue  S 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),A little concerned," I bought my 2016 Rogue in September and due to a busy fall travel schedule managed to already put 4,700 miles on it. That said, there are a few issues that make me a bit concerned about the future. This is my first brand new car.The heater is making a sound much like the motor is dying (this happened to my previous vehicle, a 2001 Nissan Frontier, about a year ago!). Also, the paint scratches very easily - so that really sucks. After getting the car washed, water will leak down onto the gas pedal. Finally, there is a high pitched squeak coming from the right side when I hit a bump or divot in the road. Other than these things, I really love my Rogue. It is great for a single 30-something guy with a big dog. Hoping it isn't a lemon.",4

The Mazda had a much narrower door opening.  Also, the back seat is slightly elevated making it easier to see for the passengers in the back.  Although the driving experience isn't as sporty as the Mazda, we really like the CVT transmission and are impressed with the fuel economy around town.

After a twenty minute drive that I drove to go over the same things the (rep) said exactly what I expected.  The vibration is a characteristic of the car. Nothing they can do. Stuck with it.

At about 500 miles, my 2016 Rogue started making a popping noise in the front wheels area when I turn the steering wheel. Nissan states it is a manufacturing defect in the struts and they a working on a solution. I already had the one of the front struts replaced and it is now much worse than the original one. Right now I am looking at an average of a new front strut every 1k miles.  I was told they know it is annoying but it is not a safety issue. That tells me they are not overly concerned with finding a solution. The paint scars and scratches easily as the paint on the wheels starting coming off within the first month.

Wish they had a sunroof for the base model S. Still figuring out all of the electronics and the weather hasn't allowed me to test winter traction. Speakers are weak but this is a base model.

If you take your car into any Nissan dealership they will tell you that this is unheard of and impossible. They will also try to tell you to go through insurance because Nissan will try to get out of everything and anything so they are not responsible. Nissan needs to advise their service workers and managers to respect their customers and not be so dismissive so quickly when something is IN FACT, THE TRUTH. Clearly there was a defect in the glass of the moon roof because it shattered all on its own. There are plenty of cases and lawsuits against this issue as well so IT IS POSSIBLE AND DOES HAPPEN.

Decided to purchase a small SUV instead of a pickup as a replacement.  So far the Rogue has been a pleasant choice.  It is solid, quiet and comfortable to drive.  It has been doing well with fuel mileage, better than the Jeep Patriot I had before the Frontier.  The surround camera system is great for parking and the Bose system is great.  Overall I am happy, with the only complaint that the 2.5 is a little rough compared to other 4's in this class, but the acceleration and highway manners more than make up for the rougher than average idle.  I looked at Ford, and Jeep comps and went with the Nissan.  Overall I think it's the better choice for me (GOOD).",5

So far very happy with almost every aspect of the vehicle.  It rides well, quiet, great fuel economy, lots of great technology and those Zero Gravity seats are VERY comfortable.  It looks great and I love the panoramic sunroof.....awesome.  The only issue I am having is a creaking noise in the front right strut tower when you turn the  streering wheel at slow speeds.  My Nissan dealer said Nissan is aware of it and working on a fix.  I will admit to being a bit OCD about noises in my vehicles.  I REALLY hope they come up with a fix soon otherwise i will have to trade it in sooner than I want to.  I would be curious if other Rogue owners have been having this issue.  But as I said, other than that issue, love the car!Update:  so Nissan did fix the strut issue and I currently am just short of 14k miles.  I continue to be pleased with the vehicle,  not much snow this winter but the traction on slippery surfaces is great.  Continues to be mechanically trouble free.25k update: Continues to be trouble free.  Assessment after a year and a half is that it is good car.  It is not going to create passion for driving, everything it does it does well.  Nothing is fantastic but it does nothing poorly either.

However, I'm a big guy and I was getting tired of a small car. My daughter will get the Fit and I started looking at SUVs. I test drove the Escape, RAV4, CRV , HRV and the new Sportage.  I tell you, I like them all but the Rogue, in my opinion, had the nicest interior and I always liked the exterior. The Ford was more sporty and higher tech, the Sportage was real nice too but it didn't even come with a spare tire and the mileage wasn't that good for this class. Can,t go wrong with any Honda product in my opinion but the HRV was a fit on steroids and I liked the Rogue feel better. The Toyota was more expensive for the similar trim level. We have a 2012 Nissan Quest van and its been great. So  I opted for the Rogue since I got a good deal. Overall, I'm very pleased. The reviews said that it did not have enough power but I find it more than adequate and I've been averaging 30 mpg! The seats are a little firm but tolerable. The ride is nice and fairly quiet. The Fit had a great sounding stereo but I'm pleased with the Rogue's. I had a problem with the passenger side front door rattling which the dealer has addressed. I think the Rogue is a excellent value and I would recommend it without reservations.",4

Matter of fact it out sells most other brands in the compact SUV class.  While all vehicles in this category share a similar shape I was drawn by the new design.  The interior is quite comfortable, feels somewhat upscale and is pretty quiet on the road.  Love the seats and the secure feeling behind the wheel, thanks to excellent handling and braking characteristics.  The elephant in the room has to be the CVT which provides better MPG's but lessens the driving experience taking much of the fun out of driving.  You never know what you'll get when you press your foot down to accelerate.  Depending where you are in the power band the vehicle usually takes its time to react.  While I'd like this vehicle better if it was more responsive the CVT trade off is higher MPG's.  Perhaps not so bad considering the ever increasing price of fuel these days.  There isn't an awful lot separating this vehicle from the pack since they're all clones.  Although I love the divide-n-hide shelf system, comes in real handy when you have a bunch of grocery bags you don't want rolling around on the way home from shopping.",4

The instrument buttons  are virtually impossible for this 70 year old  guy to read (with good sight) to read. C. The gas fill up is on the wrong side of the car,upset me and others at gas stations. C additional the sticker gas mileage is 20% over rated by my measurements.  D-Good News traded it in for a 2018 Nissan Pathfinder and am very pleased- Took a $2,500 hit,but was worth it.    GOOD LUCK if you buy one of these Dogs.",1
812, on 07/17/18 21:06 PM (PDT),Rob ,2018 Nissan Rogue  SL 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),"Good Value, but some annoyances"," I am leasing a very loaded SL with almost every option. I think Edmunds is right on two points - the SV with the premium package is probably a better deal. The CVT transmission is sluggish.  You have to step on it when going up a hill or getting onto the highway. At cruising speed it's fine, and local driving it's fine. The flip side is the gas mileage is very good for its size. The Pro-Pilot feature is very cool, especially on long trips.  This technology will get better and better. I didn't find a visibility problem while driving.  The rear view mirror isn't so great for me, but I'm used to side view mirrors from my ambulance and fire engine days. Like another reviewer said, I doubt I will buy this at the end of the lease. The SUV is common as fleas, and the tech inside will probably be expensive to fix down the road. I would be very open to upgrading before my lease expires. Oh, my kids love the sunroof and moon roof combination.",4
813, on 07/12/18 20:05 PM (PDT),Tim ,2018 Nissan Rogue  SL 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Major issues with 2018 Rogue SL AWD," I purchased my 2018 Rogue SL AWD in mid March 2018 and I have been dealing with issues since March 27th. The first issue that I’ve noticed was a very major incident that has happened 3 times while driving on the interstate (got video)  The (FEB) forward emergency braking engaged while driving luckily no other vehicles weren’t around!  Allegedly this issue was rectified on July 11th haven’t had it longer then a day to really try it! Also the audio system does a reset and locks up most times! I have to turn the vehicle off to get it to work!  The wheels have spots on them very  noticeable when the sun reflects on them (have photo) the dealership fixed them looks good they claim they buff them out but they look brand new. I’ve been in a loaner vehicle since June 27th and it’s July 12th  2017.5 Rogue SL AWD i’ve noticed a huge difference especially in mpg I’m currently getting 28.9 mpg and in my 2018 I’m getting an avg of 24-25mpg without A/C running! The reason why we are getting less gas mileage in the 2018 AWD is because the 4X4-i system is running 50% torque on rear wheels longer then needed! In the ‘17.5 it runs 50% torque in the first gear upon take off and then adjust as needed (switch your display to the 4X4-i and watch how long the torque is used on the rear wheels)!  On a dry surface you do not need that much torque throughout the other gears! I pointed that out to the technician and he gave me a slight nod! (The accelerator sensor, yaw rate sensor or 4WD controller aren’t working correctly!) And the final issue is the engine brake is not engaging when you slow down to between 25 to 40 mph  The tech odometer should rise up to 2 to 4 RPM  according to your speed while approaching a stoplight or stopping  and in the 2018 it doesn’t do that it rises up to about 1.5 rpms! You will probably not noticed that if you’ve never driven a Nissan with a CVT in it! I hope this helps and we get the these fixed!",4

It didn't have all of the bells & whistles, but she was beautiful & ran great.  I now have the 2016 Rogue SV AWD & am very disappointed.  First of all, I do a lot of long distance driving & find the driver's seat extremely uncomfortable.  In addition, the GPS is absolutely terrible & unreliable.  Literally, from the day I drove it off the lot, it took me to the wrong place!  So many roads/routes are mislabeled or nonexistent.  The Bluetooth system is also unreliable.  I cannot tell you how many times I have had dropped calls or people cannot understand what I am saying or I cannot understand them.  In addition, the voice recognition software does not work!  I'll say ""call Mary"" and it comes up that there are several options for this name - none of which sound anything like Mary! (i.e., ""Jeff"").  Overall, the car may look pretty, but there is no substance to back it up; no where near the price I have paid.",2

This is by far the best Nissan Rouge I have owned.  The leather seats are comfortable especially on long trips.  The heated seats are great in the winter and I love the sunroof.

This is my 4th Rouge lease and have never had an issue with any of them. Received a great Lease rate on my current vehicle which is why I went with the Gray Midnight Edition.

Finish of the 2018 is very good and the feature set is complete (tan leather seats, full sunroof, 19"" wheels, BOSE sound, etc.). Limited leg room for tall drivers (I am 6'3"" and the seat is as far back as it can go). You need to get used to the auto safety features (braking, steering, etc.) but they do work as advertised. As usual, the 2.5L and CVT is sluggish with high RPM and medium acceleration. Fuel economy is as expected but I need more time to really see.  Had the Rogue for two weeks now and as it was the case for my previous Rogue vehicles, I have not experienced any issues.  One glitch which doesn't affect the vehicle is Nissan Connect. Seems like when the vehicle left the factory they messed up the ID number (not VIN) so Nissan Connect cannot ""connect"". Been working with them and they are making the necessary changes on their end as I gave them the numbers they needed. Waiting for Nissan Connect to work.

827, on 03/31/18 11:55 AM (PDT),JimmyD ,2018 Nissan Rogue  SV 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),"Two steps forward, one step back"," I got out of a 2015 Rogue lease into a 2018 SV AWD with the premium package.  The price is reasonable and you got a good bang for your buck with navigation and all the other features.   The following provides a review and a comparison vs. the last version Rogue.....PROS: Paint has a great finish, the new aggressive grill looks sharp, and the alloys look great as before.  The rear taillights look slightly different, but the smokey tint looks sharp.  On the interior, seems slightly more roomy in back seat, but that could be from the look of the almond interior which looks awesome.  The black dash gives a great contrast to the car.  Front visibility still seems good, but the slightly longer kneck rests on the seats hamper rear visibility slightly more than 2015, but not it's still pretty good.  Something seems better when you drive the car, but I can't put my finger on it....like it feels a little more responsive when you hit the gas.   CONS: The Nissan paint color choices is really limited.  And the metallic colors that they do offer look goofy in the sun.  Example, the blue looks purple, the great shade of scarlet ember looks too bright in the sun, so it becomes a totally different color.  Nissan should get back to blues that look blue and maybe a good maroon color,  The new OEM Hankook tires seem to provide a little more road noise that the old Goodyear's that were equipped on the 2015 Rogues.   There seems to be a little more body roll in this version, but it's not extensive.  On the interior, this is where I think Nissan really took a step back.  The new seats are harder and more uncomfortable.  It kills the back of my legs and I can't seem to get comfortable; where the last version was comfortable driving for hours.  Very, very disappointed.  The radio seems to be weak in picking up a signal, so it can sometimes take a while to get clear reception.  Never had that issue with the 2015.  The flat steering wheel on the bottom looks cool, but just feels awkward when turning.   The infotainment screen is very poorly lit and hard to see on sunny days.  The buttons on the steering wheels are smaller and not as easy to use the the old Rogue.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I can't seem to find a way (other than speaking the command or using the touchscreen) to transition from CD/Radio/Sirious.  Overall, I think the car looks great and present s GREAT value for the SV AWD for anyone looking for a good compact SUV; but I am VERY disappointed in the choices that Nissan engineers made with the steering wheel buttons, seats, and infotainment system.",4
828, on 03/10/18 19:30 PM (PST),Laura I ,2018 Nissan Rogue  SL 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),This vehicle has a mind of its own!, My brand new 2018 Rogue automatic emergency braking system indicator flashed unnecessarily since the day I pick up the car.   The automatic emergency braking system activated for no reason when it  stopped the vehicle in the middle of a left turn with nothing in front of it but cars behind it that needed to turn into oncoming traffic to avoid rear ending my vehicle. I brought my car in for service after this incident and the dealership did not know how to fix it so they gave me a rental car while they waited for Nissan Corporate to tell them how to fix the problem.  That was 4 weeks ago and Nissan Corporate in Tennessee informed me that the investigation will take another 4 weeks.  I only drove the car for 700 miles and haven't seen it since.  I feel that Nissan should acknowledge this dangerous safety  issue and acknowledge that they are clueless on how to repair my vehicle and let me out of this lease.  I have totally lost faith in this brand and I do not trust the so called safety features that Nissan is not standing behind.  Nissan Corporate quoted that they are only following my states lemon law which is not true because the law states that the car must be repair three times with the same issue and they don't even know how to fix it so that makes the lemon law not apply to this situation.,1

832, on 01/18/18 22:24 PM (PST),Joe H ,2018 Nissan Rogue  SV 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),"3.5 stars. Not bad, but not amazing."," I've been driving this car for three weeks now. I leased it for a reasonable amount per month. It's the AWD version of the SV trim (second out of three trims, the top of the line being the SL). This car is another one of those mid $20,000 SUVs that puts more energy into creature comforts than raw performance. It has a delightful interior. It could be better in some areas, but the inclusion of a back-up camera, heated seats, remote start, and Android Auto keep me from wanting to complain too much. The seats are comfortable enough and the ride is good enough. I have no real complaints about it, but I have no real praises either. The car doesn't come with navigation, but I get it for free via Android Auto so I'm happy. The interior could be better, but it could also be much worse. The divide-and-hide feature in the back is nice and it does have fairly good cargo space. My friend doesn't complain about the backseat. Again, another one of those middle-of-the-road deals. It takes a moment to warm up, but it has an auto-starter so it helps mitigate that as well. The only real complaint I have is the engine and the continuous variable transmission. It's a very soft, sluggish drive. The set-up is decent for gas mileage, but not so great if you really want to ""drive"" your car. This is especially true if you need some extra power to pass people on the freeway or idiots on their cell phones on 45MPH roads. I'm leasing this thing for three years (2018-2021). I don't regret the lease, but I'm definitely not buying it at the end of said lease. I may even trade it in beforehand depending on the circumstances. The creature comforts are nice and for that Nissan deserves 3 stars. The engine gets it half a star because it's not useless, but it's just not interesting, either. Those who really need decent fuel economy and modern tech at a decent price and don't mind having a less-than-optimal engine could be happy with this one. However, anyone looking for a responsive car with a little juice may want to look elsewhere. I give it a 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4). I don't hate this car. I don't dislike this car. It's like that friend that you don't see that often but you kinda don't mind not seeing that often but they're still your friend, if that makes sense. It's an okay car.",3

834, on 12/15/17 16:19 PM (PST),John Ho ,2018 Nissan Rogue  SV 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),"Hastily assembled, hastily designed"," This vehicle was not thought out, designed, or assembled very diligently. My review is based on an all day test drive of the top of the line SV. The dash looks nice but peering around the rest of the interior, my eyes were drawn to poor fit and finish of several of the plastic interior panels. The interior feels closed in with huge C and D pillars that severely block rearward visibility. The more time I spent in it, the more design oversights I noticed. The sunroof is too far back and small, the exterior dimensions lead you to think the interior is roomy but it is small in ratio to the exterior. The backseat comfort seems like an afterthought. Spend 10 minutes sitting in the back and you realize it is not for long jaunts.  The seating position puts your knees upwards and the visibility out the sides, front and rear is obstructed. It was loud back there too on the freeway. On the exterior, the paint had lots of orange peel, there were panel fitment issues, and uneven gaps. On the road it was a pleasure to corner, steer, brake, and accelerate with a good road feel. However, there was pronounced tire/ wind/ road noise most notably when riding in the back seat as a passenger where it was much louder and difficult being part of the front seat conversation.  Under the hood was not well laid out. The engine was less than an inch from the passenger side frame rail and and the whole layout of lines and hoses looked like a thrown together mess.

Dealer Installed options, Auto Dimming Rear View Mirror, 'really like' and Splash Guards. Great little car that looks fantastic from the side. Roomy back seat and trunk. Cruise control works well. Outward visibility is great, especially the blind spot areas. AC and Heat work fine. It's a light car, so if it is windy out and your on the highway the game is on to try and keep it between the lines. Telescoping Steering Wheel would be nice if offered. Blue Tooth audio is bad, will not use this feature. Wife and I bought the car for our son who won't have his license for 2 months and I have been driving it daily on a 90 mile commute, its not as comfortable as my 05 Avalon but the mpg is excellent and pretty quiet on the asphalt highways. If you can afford the SV, the power windows, locks, and remoter trunk release would be handy. Our 96 Sentra with a 1.6L had over 400K and was going strong before hitting a deer and deploying  the air bags, Insurance gave us 1,500. for it, that was a great car, hopefully this one will turn out the same.",5

As the miles of my trip went by my excitement turned to despair.  This is a truly crummy car, worse than my 15 year old Hyundai Elantra.  The road noise is deafening, the acceleration is feeble, the radio was already broken, and the plastic-ness of the interior was profound.",1
853, on 11/17/16 10:16 AM (PST),Patrick J. ,2016 Nissan Versa  1.6 S 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 4A),Uncomfortable for long distances," My existing car finally bit the dust after putting 220,000 miles on her, a 2001 Suzuki Vitara small SUV. I ended up renting the Nissan Versa from Enterprise to get me around until I can buy something to replace my Vitara. My initial impressions of the Versa were positive, it looks nice outside and I have any easy time getting into and out of the car with plenty of headroom. I am not very tall at around 5'10"", but I ran into 2 problems once I sat in the driver seat. First, the center console is very low and wide, it sits forward of the shifter and the width of it hits me in my lower-right leg. This is exacerbated by the front of the driver seat which slopes upwards very steeply. The pedals are so deep in the well that I have to move the seat so far forward that I end up ""man-spreading"" to fit properly resulting in the leg/console collision. It makes it extremely difficult to drive long distances. My left leg also rubs against another cupholder that Nissan put in the lower part of the left door. The location of it makes no sense, no person in their right mind would ever want to place a cup or bottle there. As far as performance goes, this thing would easily wipe the floor off my old Vitara, I have no idea why people call this thing slow. Without blinking I find myself doing 50MPH and have done 65MPH with ease. Performance is right where it should be considering the price. However, I find that there is no sensation of speed or acceleration when driving this car. It is very weird, I will start accelerating, blink my eyes and find I am doing 50MPH. Whether I floor the accelerator or lightly press it, the car just starts going 50MPH with no sensation of reaching that speed. It actually makes it very difficult to drive speed limits of 30-40MPH and I constantly find myself unintentionally speeding. It must be some drive-by-wire nonsense causing this. There is no road vibration coming through either the accelerator or brake which makes things more difficult. The brakes are too responsive as well, I find it difficult to slow down over a distance, they clearly designed it to brake on a dime for idiots that don't know how to drive safely. Other gripes I have include the dash lighting, it has ridiculously bright white LED lighting that causes glare inside the car. There is a knob that was stupidly placed in the center of the dash forcing you to reach through the steering wheel to get to it and it doesn't work like a normal knob. You have to press in, turn and hold the knob to the left or right to make it adjust. If you adjust all the way left or right it wraps back around and goes back to full brightness which makes it damn near impossible to set to the lowest setting. My Vitara has the dimmer located as a dial on the left side near where the side mirror controls are which is far easier to adjust while driving. Another gripe is the air controls do not let you select outside air vs inside, it only goes to outside air when you use the defroster. Lastly, there is no 3.5MM Line-In on the front of the radio, super lame. One plus is the trunk is huge with plenty of room to fit stuff, maybe not as deep as some people would like, I put my groceries in there last night and they stayed in place all the way home. Overall my feeling is that this is a very modern car that Nissan failed to test with people of various body sizes and lacks the connection to the road that the best drivers look for in a vehicle.",3
854, on 10/02/16 08:20 AM (PDT),Daybud ,2016 Nissan Versa  1.6 S 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Leave my expensive cars at home drive the fun one," Last October my cousin and I were looking for a small car for him.  We ended up at a Nissan dealership and he bought a 2015 versa with roll up windows and no power door locks.  I warned him about those getting old and so I started doing my research.  I found aftermarket door locks and power windows.  The door locks are cable activated so make sure you have someone who can install them correctly.  Fast forward to July 2016 and I'm wishing I had a stick shift car because it's been a long time since I've had one.  I liked the Versa we got for my cousin so I took a gander.  Dealerships in my area are tacking $5,000 on to the window sticker as dealer mark up but an advertised special caught my eye.  The sticker was $13,185 and they were advertising one only at $8,975.  so I swooped in and bought it.  Two months later I have only driven my infiniti once and the Pilot three times.  Love this little car.  Yes, I added the power windows and the door locks to this too.  I was looking for a good navigation deck but everyone tells me to use my smart phone.  I don't have a lot of money and am retired but I was able to get good financing and so for $200 per month $300 including my insurance bill I also opted for the prepaid maintenance on the car.  The car lacks the acceleration of my other vehicles but also gets about 10 miles more per gallon so I'm retired not in any hurry.  Very comfortable roomy inside and",4
855, on 07/29/16 09:39 AM (PDT),Courtney Kurtenbach ,2016 Nissan Versa  1.6 SV 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl CVT),"Good value, but needs improvement"," Good new car for a low price, but definitely nothing very fun. The car is quite slow, acceleration is terrible (but then again, I'm used to driving a car with a turbo engine, so if you're not used to a faster car it might be fine). You can hear the car struggling when trying to speed up. I also found the steering to be pretty bad. Maybe it's just different from what I'm used to, but the steering seemed to be not very responsive and stiff. I could feel quite a bit of resistance when I tried to turn the wheel. It made it difficult to make small adjustments. Braking was very nice and responsive, though. Interior is very comfortable and roomy. A bit disappointed with the kind I had though, as it had no backup camera or touch screen display. The audio system was actually pretty nice, though. Overall a good car for the price, but personally I would need something a bit nicer in performance if I were going to get a 2016.",3
856, on 06/25/16 23:10 PM (PDT),Dave the Rave ,2016 Nissan Versa  1.6 S 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Totally Awesome Car," I bought this for my daughter, whose used car was on its last legs. I am very happy with our Versa S 5 speed manual. Attention Tall drivers: I am 6' 6"" and I fit comfortably with plenty of head and leg room in the front seats. Rear seating has less headroom, but plenty of leg room. The seats are comfortable with lumbar support even on my base model. I do not feel like I am in a subcompact when in this car. It feels roomy.  The AC is nice and cold and instrumentation is easy to see and use. What makes this car special, though, is how much fun it is to drive. We have the zippy 5 speed manual. I really had forgotten how much fun it is to drive a stick, and the versa puts a smile on my face. The gearing seems well spaced with just enough growl to enjoy. Braking is good and solid, and the handbrake is easily used to prevent rollback. The only drawback for me is that there is only one keyhole, on the driver's door, which I will hope stays functional. Having replaced power window mechanisms and keys with chips in other cars, I am happy with the crank windows and standard keys ( get a copy at Home Depot) that will keep my money in my pocket. Overall, for the price, an excellent value and a fun car to drive. Update: The above review was for my daughter's car, but 3 months later my own car died. Because I continue to  be impressed by this car, I went and got a Versa S 5-Speed Manual for myself. I love zipping around in this car. It is fun, roomy and comfortable.  BTW the Bluetooth Phone system is excellent. Callers can't tell I'm talking hands-free and I can devote my attention to shifting. I am very happy with my decision to buy two of these  - for what I had previously paid for one car. Update in 2018: I still love this car. It is dependable and a joy to drive. Frugal drivers take note: It uses regular oil, not the expensive synthetics.",5

The dealership tacked on stuff from outer space that the sales guy has still not explained to me after the sale (Nissan of Vacaville). They were supposed to make some additions, but after almost a month, I've had to contact them a few times and they tell me every time that they will get back to me. RIGHT!!! The versa gets great gas mileage and handles the turns really well. While there is plenty of cargo space in the trunk, the glove box is a giant black hole, and there is no console. There are cup holders crammed in the center and the doors, but if you get anything larger than a small beverage you'll have trouble getting at them.",3
858, on 06/05/16 05:55 AM (PDT),Frank ,2016 Nissan Versa  1.6 S 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Excellent for the money," The good: Great price, I paid under $10,500 out the door (tax, license, etc not included).  I paid more for a 1991 Civic LX in 1990.  That Civic had electric door locks and power windows, but no ABS or airbags.I like the ride.  I wouldn't call it plush, but certainly comfortable for a small car.  I find the car fairly quiet ... I don't have problem with using the phone when driving at highway speed. The 5MT and engine provide acceptable power ... I don't notice the problem going up hills the professional reviews have commented on.  The big mile-long hill near me I go up in 5th without losing speed although I do have to hit the gas.  Gas mileage is excellent ... getting higher than advertised if I don't roast it.   The manual transmission and clutch are really smooth and easy to use.  Long throw, but the clutch engagement is really light.  Easy to drive.  I like the steering ... it is quite strongly assisted, but it is easy to turn the wheel.  I can see how some prefer more feel, but this doesn't bother me.  The trunk is huge.  There is a donut spare, but it looks like there is room for a full size spare.  There wasn't in my 1991 Civic ... I did buy the full sized spare for that car but it didn't fit in the well. For this Versa, a full size spare would definitely fit. Hands free phone works great; connection with my android was painless.  With the aux in and a $5 lighter-USB adapter, I play music on my phone no problem.  I haven't used my CDs since ripping them, but now they have a use.  The styling of this car is nice.  Expert reviews bitching about a lack of soft touch plastic inside are a laugh.  Who said soft touch plastic is the best?  I can guarantee you the hard plastic used in the Versa S is more durable than ""soft"" thin skin plastic over polyurethane ... and what are the reviewers doing touching the plastic inside anyhow?  Shouldn't they also note the taste of this plastic isn't as good as much more expensive cars too? There is a remote trunk release inside the cabin ... some reviews say there is not.  Car comes standard with nice Continental tires.  The FM radio reception is quite good; controls on the steering wheel are convenient.The bad: The display (mileage, miles left in the tank, trip, etc) could be better ... you have to choose displays so I can't see trip and total miles or miles per tank on the same display.  There is a tachometer, but only idiot lights for everything else. Not much adjustment for the seat, but it does fit me quite well.  The steering wheel does adjust up and down.The rear seat backs don't fold down on this model.  Rear brakes are drum. Storage is limited.  Although the glove compartment is huge (non locking), other than this, cup holders in middle and on doors, and a small slot between seats that is too small for my Nexus 6P, there is no storage.  A space for quarters or storage of little things would have been nice.   The ugly:  No automatic door locks takes some getting used to.  The locks are a bit more difficult to actuate than they should be.  Only one door lock on the driver side ... lets hope it never goes bad.  OTOH, I just leave the car doors open with nothing of value inside.  Most thieves don't look at the cheapest new car sold in America thinking there must be a lot of valuables inside.  Other than that, not much else I can bitch about.  There is an amazing amount of space for the rear passengers.      Comments on the car ratings from professional reviews.  I look at several sites that provide professional reviews and see this car at or near the bottom.  I wanted an inexpensive commuter car with good gas mileage, hands free phone, the ability to play music on my phone, and this car fits the bill nicely.  It has hard plastic inside ... oh boo hoo.  If this is what you have to complain about, things are looking pretty good.  Cars costing thousands more have more features ... duh.  More than a year on I still love this little car, but understand the difference between the stick and CVT versions ... the stick is what I have and recommend.After 20 months, I still love this car.Update 2 years and 35K miles. There isn't another Nissan I'd buy ... you want to trade my 5MT Versa for your CVT Maxima?  Not a chance. Americans are missing out with their love affairs with CVT & other automatic transmissions. Gas mileage is 33-38 depending on how fast I'm going. Roll down windows and manual locks take a second more to use than electric. My Continental tires are worn close to the limit after 35K miles so I'm thinking of switching to Michelins.  But no, I wouldn't trade this car for anything with an automatic, even a Porsche. Not hyperbole,  automatics, even those silly ones with gear shift on the wheel, are lame. I love this little beater.",5

That's great, because the Versa has those bases covered.  But you should also know that this clumsy little gas-miser can also be an incredibly fun and engaging drive.  I own and daily drive a 2015 Versa S with a five-speed manual, and it has quickly become one of the most fun cars I have ever owned - and I've owned a lot of cars.  I absolutely love tossing this car through the corners, driving directly over every bump in the road, and taking all five gears up to an raucous 5000 RPM.  The claimed 109 horses take a very heavy foot to reel in.  The interior panels rattle and creak in protest of every bump.  The front suspension compresses far too much during hard cornering.  Understeer is standard.  The back-end seemingly drags on the ground behind you.  Yes, I drive this car hard.  Very hard.  It roars, it rattles, it thumps and clunks, and I love every second of it. While I'm having fun, I'm also enjoying fantastic economy and mostly worry-free ownership.  Mixed driving brings me 37 mpg average and just one visit to the pump per week.  Oil and air filters are so cheap that I replace both every 3000 miles.  There are no fancy electronic parts to fail, no expensive interior surfaces to worry over, no fancy paint job to polish and protect, no shiny alloys to dodge potholes for.  My Versa is so cheap, in fact, that it came with rust pre-embedded in paint.  Yes, my brand new car is already rusty.  BUT - I just don't care.  I bought this car to get from A to B, not to worry about.  Even with the rust and cheap build quality, I like the way the Versa sedan looks.  When it's cleaned up, it looks kind of sophisticated, grown up, mature.  Contrary to what the price may tell you, the Versa is not for everyone.  If you're looking for a smooth, quiet ride, don't buy a Versa.  If you're looking for state of the art electronics, don't buy a Versa.  If you want high tech engine management, disc brakes at all four corners, fully independent suspension... Don't buy a Versa.  If you own a track car, the Versa is a perfect daily beater for you.  If the best car you've ever owned as and E30, the Versa is a perfect daily beater for you.  If you don't want to worry about locking your doors ever again, the Versa is a perfect daily beater for you.  If you're anything like me, then buying a Versa for you commute will make you very happy.",4

When you buy basically the lowest price car sold in the US, you are not expecting luxury or high quality in every component or system of the car.  But you DO get what you pay for!  You get a good, reliable car at a great price!  One annoying negative for me: I knew the car did not have power locks or power windows, but only the driver's door has a lock for the key --- if you return to the car on the passenger side , you have to walk all the way around the car to unlock it, get in, then unlock the passenger door if you want or need to open it.",4

The car comes standard with everything manual: manual 5 spd.transmission, windows, door locks, seats, and key.  I was able to make a copy of my key for $2.00 when it would cost me over $200+ to replace my chip key for my Honda and VW.

I picked mine after borrowing or renting the Spark, Cruse, Fiesta, Focus, 500, Lancer, Impreza, Yaris, Corolla, Fortwo, Fit, Civic, Soul, Rio, Accent and lastly Mirage. It was a close tie between the Mirage for its 100,000 mile warranty, color choices, battery pack free hybrid like economy with far better than advertised fuel economy in the mid 50''s to low 60's and Versa for its balance of larger rear seat space, good fuel economy, higher dealer service/parts availability.",4

End 04/18 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 5M),New 2018 Versa for 10499 with 5 speed stick & a/c," I enjoy a fancy car that truly impresses or a basic car that doesn't pretend to be fancy.  The Versa is basic and looks good with plenty of real room inside.  You never feel cramped in the Versa sedan nor do you have a lack of trunk room.  You also don't get the erie feeling that a rear end collision will crush your back seat occupants.  This car is almost as big as some compact and mid sizers namely the Mazda 6 from early 2000s.  The car handles the road well and the stick is the way to go.  I hear the cvt is an issue.  Id actually would have liked the 4 speed auto that they offered a few years ago, but its gone.  So I shift and save and save I did.  I drove to Ohio from Buffalo to save 1400 on the car and paid 10499 on a 13200 msrp model.  I was very happy with that price.  No qualifications to get it/ 1500 rebate and the rest was discount.  The last time I paid around 10k for a new car was back in 2011 on a chevy aveo for 7000 new at Christmastime.  But that was with gm card roundups.  This Versa is way better than an Aveo and I hope to get 200k miles out of it.  I actually have seen some 200k mile Aveos around!  The Interior issues on older Versas have been solved with better seat materials and a tach along with Bluetooth.  So this inside is Very good and comfortable.  I had a Mirage and I liked it but I like the Versa better.",5

The interior is very nice, but the truck lacks a few amenities a “platinum” should come standard with. Not having power folding mirrors is a big disappointment. Leg room is also poor if you’re over 6’ tall. My biggest complaint is the throttle response and the transmission. There have been several instances where either the slow throttle response or turbo lag has nearly gotten me broadsided. The transmission (which is the same POS that dodge once used) shift erratically when driving in stop and go, in town traffic. I have owned Ford, Chevy, and Dodge diesel trucks, and the 5.0 Cummins in this Nissan has the worst throttle response and turbo lag of any of them. Going to try a programmer soon to see if that helps with these issues.",3

They say the engine light code shows a bad control valve assembly and transmission control module.  But the truck has been hesitating and lurching and fluttering on acceleration since it had a thousand miles on it, and the dealership said they were aware of the problem but didn't know how to fix it.  Now the truck has broken down on the side of the road, we limped it into the local dealership, and Nissan North America still doesn't know when parts can be delivered to the dealership.  Its a nightmare.  I'm in a crappy rental even though I have a bumper to bumper warranty for 100,000 miles or 5 years.  But basically I don't have a truck anymore.  Buyer beware.

I had a 2006 gasoline Titan and it drove great I had over 200k on it when I gave it someone else. There is something seriously wrong with the new diesel models. Randomly the truck runs ruff and the cab fills with chokingly strong fumes. The truck is averaging 10.5 MPG and the dealership says there nothing they can do! The transmission sucks and shifts horribly!! The parking sensors randomly go off. The DEF sensor has something wrong with it you have to get under the truck to tap it for the alert go off before it shuts the truck down! I am the 3rd owner of a 2016 with less than 10k miles.

I've had quite a few of them for my business and they held up very well. The all new designed Titan XD diesel first came out in 2016 and I just had to have it. Looked great. Unfortunately mine was a lemon. I took the gamble being the first year they came out and lost. In the shop for air conditioning going out 6 times, transmission really jerky shifting, acceleration was almost non existent from a complete stop (serious safety issue in my opinion), and diesel smell in the cabin almost every time it ""regenerates"". The diesel smell happened about every 2-3 days for about 5 minutes each time. When it did happen it was almost gagging. Have to have the windows down till it cleared out. I've had the truck for 1 1/2 years and decided that was long enough and plenty of time for Nissan to try to fix the problems. With that many problems it was a candidate for the lemon law. With the help of an attorney, Nissan bought back the truck (1/5/2018) and paid me back every penny the truck cost, minus taxes, tag, etc. I have to give credit to Nissan for the buy back without any hassles at all and I feel they were more than generous to complete the transaction. I did speak to the general manager at my local dealer and he said the newer 2017 model diesels have not changed and were possibly going to have problems like I had. I didn't give up on Nissan and purchased a 2017 (new) regular Titan Platinum Reserve edition, GAS engine. I've only had a couple hundred miles but this truck drives like a Cadillac! Extremely smooth riding. Nissan has there work cut out on the Titan XD Diesel trucks still. I've even checked online in the Titan forums and there are hundreds there alone with mostly the diesel smell in the cabin and about half with transmission issues. It's also a very stiff ride (like a tank) compared to the Titan. The biggest problem is this was the first truck that I practically fell in love with, but with some relationships it was time to part ways and say good bye.",2

It tows a modest camper very well, is very stable on the road, good in the snow.  It is also heavier than competitor's 1 ton trucks, so it handles in a cross wind with a camper very well.  Dealerships are still learning how to handle the diesel engines.  It has been a routine occurrence where the dealership has not had the diesel tech available, or a lift that could handle the truck.  Be prepared for high dealership services costs, ~$350 to $600 every 10,000 miles.  I will not be going to dealerships once the warranty expires.  It has plenty of power, but not as much as a 3/4 or 1 ton truck.  The diesel is most advantageous on the highway and towing.  Having the engine's maximum torque output at 1,800 RPM makes a big difference during typical driving and towing.",4

SAFETY ISSUE.," I am concerned and Nissan should be too. This is a serious safety issue. This issue has happened three times since I purchased this truck less than 3 weeks ago. In the middle of driving I suddenly lose power as if I let off the gas pedal, only I don't. It just starts coasting and wont respond to me pushing down on the accelerator. All the electrical power stays intact. The RPMs stay around 1 no matter how far down I push the gas pedal. The most serious incident occurred a day ago. I pulled out from a stop sign. As I turned right I accelerated to 10 mph then nothing. No response to me pushing the gas pedal.  I floored it, nothing. I eased into it, nothing. It slowed to 5 mph and crept until I could pull off on a side street.  I put it in park and back in drive and it seemed to do the trick. If I had been crossing traffic I would have stalled and been hit by an oncoming car. The first time this incident happened I was cruising along at 40 mph when it just died on me. It slowed to 15 mph as I pushed to accelerator. It happened over 3-5 seconds. All of a sudden it came back to life and leaped up in RPMs. I emailed Nissan a week ago when it first happened. No response. I emailed them this time. No response. I called them and they have instructed I take it in to a dealer, which I will. It is 2016 certified pre-owned. Its a nice truck but of course not worth risking someone's life/health. Needless to say I'm a regretful owner.",2

I learned in marketing that the majority don't say anything if they are happy with their purchase and the Majority who are unhappy will say something. My truck pulls and drives like a dream. Everything works. Not one complaint here. I would recommend this truck anyone wanting more power in a full size truck but also wants great fuel economy. On the hwy I've avg as high as 24 mpg but going a seady 65 mph. Step it up to 80 mph and I'm getting 19 mpg.  My Toyota Tacoma with it's 6 banger never got over 19 mpg no matter what and avg 15 to 16. I love the size of this thing and is great on a long road trip.  I'd like a bigger tank that 26 gals but that will get you 500 + miles.  When you tow 8000 lbs you'll drop to 15 mpg or so. My Tacoma would tow 2000 lbs and get 10 or 11 mpg. Simply an awesome truck.  Love that Cummins. They sound so sweet and love to be driven hard.  The big three better take notice. Nissan has sold all years of these things out although be it in limited numbers. However, They never advertised for this truck. I've never even seen one commercial. If you when by commercials you'd think the only full size trucks out there are Ford, Chevy and Ram.",5

However, towing our Toy Hauler was a lot of work for it. The Cummins 5.0 turbo diesel is strong. First time I towed with it, I used the cruise control, and just drove. That was great. Plenty of power for this 5/8 ton truck. But, since we also use it for shorter trips, it has had to do ""re-gen"" on the particulate filter more than I like. So, fuel economy is poor.",5

All I can say is wow!!  I'm now only at 7K miles on the odometer!!  This is my sixth Nissan/Infiniti up till now every vehicle has been bullet proof.  Have to say every single issue being reported about this vehicle seems to be absolutely true.  Transmission abrupt shifting, diesel odor in cabin, clunking noise in front end, power cut off when turning, and electronic issues!!  Transmission shifting hard up and down.  On the way home from the dealership in TN headed to OH the vehicle was barely drivable.  It shifted so hard down that I was seriously concerned it would damage itself so I had to drive it at constant speed making trip intense to say the least.  Note this was after the TN dealership supposedly completed the ""transmission update"".  I limped vehicle into dealership in Dayton OH.  Dayton Nissan dealer completed transmission update and advised vehicle good to go.  Picked up vehicle and drove it off lot...first lot clunk!  All day long...downshift clunk!...upshift pop!.  Oh man now I'm really getting concerned.  I'm so concerned about transmission damaging itself that I'm overlooking the other problems.  But lets talk about those.  My next main concern is the loss of power when turning.  You turn and hit the gas to accelerate and there is nothing there!!  I'm not talking turbo lag I'm talking literally the power goes to zero!  Then equally bad when after it goes to zero it lags big time then abruptly comes on.  I've been trying different driving habits to see if it does this in straight aways or if it is strictly on turns.  It is most definitely more pronounced when turning.  Talk about dangerous!!  Just today pulled out at major intersection and gas truck coming towards light in first lane...pull out quarter way when I realize man this guy can't stop.  Turning left.  Hit gas to get away as smoke is billowing out from under his truck and nothing!!  Thank Jesus as the truck was going to smack me broadside power kicked on and I escaped major incident if not death.  Wow!!  Had I been driving my BMW X5 diesel under same circumstances it would have jetted me away so quick I wouldn't have even thought about it later in the day.  This thing is a potential death trap!  Ok so enough drama.  The odor enters the cabin while idling, driving slow, and occasional a waft or two while tooling down the highway.  My friend the other day while idling was like ""dude seriously this thing is making me nauseous"".  I'm like well you get used to it after awhile.  He was like hurry up and get me to our destination I don't know how you are driving this like this.  Electronics are full of gremlins on this baby.  Get in fire her up and on comes the screen stating tran data is being transmitted...shift into R and camera should kick on ...would be nice...but instead screen doesn't change!  Good thing I didn't back up because a kid was standing behind my truck and well...hmm...accident!!  Are you kidding me?!!  What good is a back up camera on a vehicle if it isn't reliable?!  It is more unsafe might as well disconnect it!!!  Ok so lets talk about more issues that are nuisance but not going to cause bodily injury or death.  Back up and get to bottom of drive and springs in front compress as wheel is turned and squeak squeal creak groan.  Is this a new Nissan Titan XD Premium or a 1952 Ford?  I would argue the 52 Ford pickup wouldn't make these many noises when simply backing up!  Embarrassing to say the least.  I could keep going but I'm tired now of hating this vehicle already.  I've owned probably 75 different vehicles mostly new and never anything remotely like this beast.  Right now it is a beast of burden.  Going back into the shop next week I'll keep you posted.  Expectations very low at this point based on the fact Car and Driver just rated Nissan Titan XD they have at 30K and it most definitely is a lemon!!",1

The day I drove the truck home I felt a vibration coming from what appeared to be the rear of the truck and the steering was also pulling hard to the right. I assumed these would be simple repairs. After a month in the shop the dealers did 3 front end alignments that did not change anything . Each time supposedly using new specs .They addressed the vibration by installing new tires on a new truck with 2k miles.The dealer then rotated and balanced the tires several times which did not do anything to correct the vibration.  The service supervisor at the second dealer I took it to agreed after all their work the issues have not been corrected . The dealer allowed me to drive another new titan XD PRO 4x and it did the exact  same thing my truck did. The dealer suggested I contact Nissan consumer affairs. After reading about how unhelpful Nissan consumer affairs has been I decided to get rid of the truck while I still could. I did allot of research  before I purchased this truck and chose the XD because I currently own the first generation titan and a Nissan Armada that I have been happy with. Whats truly disappointing is Nissan has to Know about these issues but has chosen not to address them. I did not want to get stuck with a lemon so I decided to trade in the Titan with 6K miles on it for a F250 .This Titan  has serious issues and the dealers have no knowledge on how to correct them.

Comparing the titan with many other 3/4 ton trucks I've spent countless miles in, I'd say the Titan XD takes top honors in being a well rounded every day truck when considering: size, capability, power, fit and finish, and comfort.  The titan XD is by far the quietest truck of the bunch and consistently has me appreciating the engineering of the truck, while my girlfriend enjoys the comfort and quietness of the truck.  The new 3/4 ton trucks have outrageous power numbers; however, I have learned these trucks HAVE to be worked and worked hard.  The need to develop enough heat to burn off the soot in the exhaust after-treatment systems  otherwise you are destined for issues (Yes, I'm mostly a < 30 mile / day guy and those driving habits were very problematic in my 6.7 Cummins and all the 6.7 Powerstrokes we have at work).  In my opinion, the Titan's 5.0 Cummins with dual sequential turbo setup is the right amount of power to get the job done, provides excellent throttle response, and most importantly it is small enough that the motor will get a decent load cycle running the truck empty to where the engine pushes enough heat on short runs to still keep up with burning off the soot and keeping the EGR clean.  My other high note for the truck is the Aisin transmission.  This thing shifts on the money every time both upshifts and downshifts whether light load or towing.  As you can see, I'm impressed with this Titan XD having just turned 20,000 miles.  My 1 big deciding factor I'll leave you with is this:  I bought my Titan XD with an $11,000 rebate.  At that price point I'd recommend a Titan over any competition in it's price class for the user who appreciates diesel power and realistically tows > 5,500 lbs but < 10,000 on a regular basis.  However, if Titan drops the rebates to < $6,000, I would have to say I'd make the shift into a 3/4 ton truck at that price point. Nissan, are you listening???  Keep those rebates to keep the truck priced where it should be priced.  Hope my review helped.",5

907, on 11/18/16 11:25 AM (PST),Shawn Davis ,2016 Nissan Titan XD  PRO-4X 4dr Crew Cab 4WD SB (5.0L 8cyl Turbodiesel 6A),Pro 4x Cummins," First off I have always been a Chevy guy. Had a Ford once! I searched and test drove the Toyota (to small of bed with the quad cab), the Chevy Z71, the Ford F250, and the Dodge eco and 2500. Then I test drove the Titan XD, the decision was made. First Nissan I've owned but I have several friends that love them. If it wasn't for the Cummins, I never would have considered this truck as an option. The MSRP is high on these loaded trucks, but I was able to get it for $43k with everything but leather (never been a fan of leather or sunroofs). You can't touch a truck with all of these options for anywhere close to that price. I only tow my 20' boat and a 23' trailer so this is far more capable of anything I will ask of it. This thing corners awesome, 60 in a 30 with no tire noise, leaning, or loose feel you get out of most vehicles this size. 2500 miles and the def tank is showing max full. It is the quietest of the diesels by far, and I have high hopes for the long term reliability of the Cummins. It has more of a truck feel than the Chevy, but rides a whole lot better than the others I drove. The Pro 4x interior seems very durable and well built. It has way more options than I cared to have, but they all do now unless you want a stripped down work truck. Stock it leaves room for improvement in the acceleration department, but the torque comes on low and strong. If it wasn't for the TCS, you would run the rubber off the tires in 10k miles. The front seating position is by far the best of anything else I drove. It is a very big truck, long wheel based for the quad cab and 6.5' bed. So the turning radius is a bit wide. It does look a lot like the ford from the side view and a little like a cross between a Toyota and a Ford elsewhere. That big front end is very much need to fit the Cummins in the truck with out it being crammed in like the Ford (body removal required to work on it). Fuel mileage could be better also, but I have a California version and I'm sure that has something to do with it. As low as 8mpg running around town, and as much as 21.8mpg on flat highway trips. Running a 16.1 average overall since new. Maybe it will get better with some break in, I can hope anyway. Plenty of ground clearance for the average off road guy. The built in trailer brake and heavy receiver with a duel plug are great options that I would have had to add. The bed lighting and tie down system is by far the best out of all the others. The soft drop easy up locking tail gate are also great user friendly options. I will have to add side steps for my wife who taps out at 5'1"". Once I get my break in miles out of the way, a programmer, exhaust, and air cleaner will be added. So far so good, time will tell the rest.",4

Needing a truck to handle the day to day business and when needed be able to tow big loads. Now driving it quite a bit it's been in the shop 4 times already. Right off the bat the engine acceleration was terrible, to the point it almost caused an accident trying to merge with highway traffic. In the mileage put on its used roughly 6 gallons of def fluid. Nissan informed me the engine adds fuel to try and burn emissions ""soot"" then if that fails it will use the fluid. I've seen the truck get 17-18 mpg under certain circumstances. I've had the truck back just to verify there was no emission or driveability issues.                                                    My recommendations? I would only recommend this truck if your pulling huge loads all the time. Anything else your wasting huge amounts of fuel.",3

But there's so many Chevys and Fords I wanted to stand out. I drove from IA to AK to pickup my Titan pro4x 5.6 because I couldn't find the correct trim I wanted in the area. I trailered a 2010 Nissan Maxima with a Chevy 2500 Hd, traded the Maxima and pulled the 2500 with the Titan. I have to say it's pulls like nothing is behind you, I did notice it couldn't decide what gear to stay in through acceleration but after I removed the trailer it was fine. I wanted to really test the truck and going up a hill I was doing 80 mph no problem. So it's definitely a work horse. Gas gauge is hard to see with the steering wheel in the way. Also I did have to add power steering fluid because it started making a winning noise. Bluetooth to my S5 doesn't stay connected at times. Rockford speakers hit hard and the tool boxes are very handy for storing items. A lot people are buying diesel but you have to think what the maintenance is going to be later down the road on a Cummings and you have to purchase def blue. More of a expense through the years and a headache going to the auto part store. Overall I think Nissan did a good job, and I'm very happy with my purchase. But we will see how it holds up over the next 30,000 miles.

How can a brand new vehicle still come out with no headrests in the center positions for both rows?  This is unacceptable for my kids.  That is the only thing keeping me from buying this truck.  Toyota and Ford have this figured out with 3 point restraints and headrests for the front and rear middle seats.  What a terrible oversight.

I have been researching about this truck since a year until I finally got it a month ago. I test drove the big 3's and let me admit that none of them has a riding comfort and technological advance features like this one has. The round view monitor is the best add on and the towing capacity is way better than a 1/2 ton. The V8 Cummins in this truck is the only V8 that cummins make and it is powerful and quite. This truck has a 6.5 foot bed and a 120 v outlet in the bed and that is a great add for campers or people loving off road adventures. Watch for the new Nissan offers on MSRP for 2016 models.

MPG has been about 20.6 so far combined on an engine that has only 400 miles on it so it is far from broken in yet.

I have to say I was intimidated at first, this thing is huge compared to the sedans and suv's I have had over time, but this beast drives smooth and quiet with plenty of room for the gang.   Not sure what it was about the personality of the car but it just kinda spoke to me (buy me)  not sure if it was the Cummins diesel badge or the 4x4 or the quality of the ride or the reliability of Nissan (owned several including Infinity).  I have read some complaints about cost or power, I guess because I dont know much about trucks but this thing could pull over 12k, Dang a 30ft Eliminator speed boat ways about 5k lbs.  whoever complains about its towing capacity is just looking at and apple when the obviously need a orange.  The other negative I have seen is comparable trucks are cheaper, I just dont think this is true.  someone compared a loaded SV against a stripped version of a 2500 and said it was too expensive, just silly.

The Titan XD is the best truck for the everyday driver who doesn't tow excessively. If you tow a lot, get a bigger truck. Same money (-ish) and more power/capability. But that's not to say the XD isn't a great tow vehicle. It is hands down better than any 1/2 ton. I don't care what you read or saw in a review. The brakes, chassis, frame, tranny, suspension....EVERYTHING works well for towing and they are miles better than anything offered by even the best 1/2 ton (yes a 1/2 might be able to pull a heavy load since the motors are great, but the frame/suspension/brakes fall short). Make sure you get a truck that is slightly overbuilt for your needs. The 5.0L Cummins is a great motor, but definitely protects itself (by not over-working when demanded like Ford will for example). Powerful for around town and anything less than a 13,000lbs trailer. Fuel mileage could be considerably better when unloaded, but it's because of a practically 3/4 ton chassis and the smaller motor - compared to a true 3/4 or 1 ton motor. Also...the range is horrible. Need to stop way too often when towing. The fuel tank AND urea tank both need to be larger. That said, the cabin is quiet and it has the best ride quality of ANY truck. Small things like the ease of lifting the tailgate and the trailer-light check make this truck killer. Plus the warranty is arguably the best in the business. I have received many compliments by Ford, Dodge and Chevy owners. I'm not super happy about the mammoth front-end of the truck, but if you get it in the Pro4x trim, you don't have so much gaudy chrome that makes it look like an F-150 or the chromed out Dodges (unless that's your thing). Absolutely no problems thus far and I haven't been all that nice to my XD. I actually use my truck! :-)",5

Nissan, shame on you! (My 2006 Xterra S is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned...) The early pics of the new Titan were concerning;  it looked like a mash-up of various other brands, and just way overdone, e.g. the ridiculous emblems on the front fenders. Still, I wanted to see the truck in person and drive the beast. When it finally arrived at a close-enough dealer, I made the trip. Talk about a let-down! This thing is an abomination. Just WAY too big for a 'tweener. Maybe it should be marketed to WWE performers, because it's so massive in every respect. Except performance. Sluggish acceleration, and despite having a price tag at or above ""real"" heavy duty trucks, it does not provide real heavy duty truck capabilities. The SV I looked at and drove had an MSRP of $55k, and the dealer wasn't going to ""move much"" off that price. Yet I could buy a RAM 2500 with the awesome Cummins 6.7 liter diesel and its 370 HP and 800 (!!) ft-lbs of torque -- for $51k after dealer markdowns. In summary, I could buy this new Titan (and I was truly a Nissan advocate, having owned five of their vehicles in the last 15 years) with less capability and unproven reliability but pay more for it, vs. a proven star heavy duty truck in the RAM mentioned. No contest. Unless Nissan cuts their pricing by $10k, I don't know why anybody would opt for the 'XD'. I would be astonished if Nissan meets their sales expectations with this XD. On the other hand, they sold what, like 12k Titans in all of 2015? (Ford sells that many F150s in a week...) Thumbs down, and a Bronx jeer to Nissan for letting their Frontier and Xterra become old and obsolete. New models should have been released several years ago, including a diesel option and better/more adjustable SEATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's as smooth as any of the gas engines I drove including the Tundra and Silverado, but has the torque of a Diesel.  In fact, I think it's smoother than the Silverado.  What I noticed about it is the suspension is so soft and smooth.  I don't have to have a 10K lb trailer behind me to give me a smooth ride like I would in a Duramax or Powerstroke.

You d be surprised how much this little thing will fit, it's much more comfortable than the other small cars available too us, our yaris is uncomfortable on long hauls, our fiesta is just a ticking time bomb on it's last leg with the transmission, our impreza is unimprezzive always getting repairs, and our other two aren't the same category so no need to compare. But the versa has the most comfortable interior over the impreza and much comfier than the yaris. Gas mileage has been phenomenal. The CVT actually isn't too bad, pick-up in town is perfect, highway it's a tad slow, dirt roads can be terrifying with the skinny tires, brakes have been outstanding, entertainment system is your typical bland base system any car brand offers. Visibility is another major plus over the impreza and yaris, all in all for our purpose it's amazing. If you need a good delivery vehicle for inner city purposes, check out the versa, it's a amazing city car.",4

It does just fine for a 4cyl engine and gas mileage is great. Exterior is a bit deceiving because it's bigger inside than it looks. This car fit what our needs are ; gas mileage, room, and low mileage. Easy fold down back seats for extra carrying space, roomy back seat area for passengers which is surprising. We weren't in need of alot of extra bells and whistles and are pleased with option of having the   SiriusXM ( love it) and back up camera. Just gotta be careful of cement parking dividers in parking lots as car is low to ground, but so easy to manuevor.

It only has a 10.8 gallon tank.  Your driving range is not too far. The 31/39 MPG on the paperwork is not too real. The computer on the dash says your travelling at 34 to 40 MPG in town . At 229 miles the low on gas light kicks off and the dash starts counting down how much mileage you have left in the tank. I had 41 miles. I then filled the car 8.8 gallons with 39 miles on the dash computer. 229/8.8 = 26 mpg not the listed 31. I am not a speed freak I got the car for the MPG rating.Note: 6 months later the car still does not reach it's MPG rating. The true mileage is always 4-5 miles below the posted on the dash number.,3

No base model for us the SV wirh appearance package for him and the SR with tech and navigation for me. What I like is quiet and smooth ride without feeling like I am in a small car. I like good vision all around the car and ample head room. Has a roomy feel unlike others that I tested.I tested all cars in the same category and choose the versa note. The gas mileage made up for the suv ride I previously had. It has pick up for interstate driving and it handles the rode great. I had to give up the old thinking big is better and safer and try something different.,5

AT first I was surprised with how much space was in such a small car for the passengers at least, as the trunk space is rather symbolic. Nonetheless, once I started driving it all the charm disappeared. Was traveling alone, doing about 400 miles trip. Actually had to do more frequent stops than in any other car I drove in so far due to the pain in my back. The driver's seat is poorly made and absolutely not ergonomic at all. Not to mention it does not have any adjustments that could make it at least bearable. Road behavior of this car was not terrible, till it got hilly, and I had to stick to the slow, right line as its acceleration was marginal at best. The only good thing about tis car is it was cheap to rent and got about 36 MPG. That's about it. I've got a similarly weak car in the past, it was 1994 mazda cx3 with 1.6 motor and automatic transmission, yet the mazda's front seats were way better than this nissan's ones.",2
934, on 05/02/18 09:02 AM (PDT),James Reyome ,2016 Nissan Versa Note  1.6 SV 4dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl CVT),Second Versa is Second to None!," First off, you probably should know that this is our second Versa. We really like the model...it is, it seems, as close to our ideal vehicle as exists today. Sure, we wouldn't mind some cavernous SUV but the fact is that we can't afford it, and with gas getting dearer and dearer still we appreciate the economy of a well built ""misermobile"". We bought the first used as well and have put 140K miles on it (so far...it's still running well!) but we were ready to get another, thus the 2016 Versa Note SV. We purchased this one via Enterprise Car Sales and I cannot say enough about the buying experience...first rate all the way; great price, wonderful vehicle, just what we were looking for, and with pre-arranged financing through our credit union we were in and out of the dealership in well under an hour. Now, as to the car...first things first, it's not a race car, so take reviews from sites like Car and Driver and Motor Trend and their ilk with a VERY large grain of salt. The Versa Note is a commuter car, and it does that job exceedingly well. It rides well, has a quiet, roomy cabin (I am 6' 3"" and fit fine both in the back seat and behind the wheel) and everything is laid out logically. The SV package includes just about every electronic widget you could possibly desire sans navigation, but that's why I have an iPhone and a GPS. The backup camera is a nice touch but with so many enormous windows it isn't wholly necessary. It's nice to have, though. The body style is a significant upgrade from the rather shoe-like boxiness of the 2011 Versa we own, and is very pleasing to look at. The cargo space is remarkable with the rear seats folded down (my bicycle fits just fine, thank you!) and the Divide-n-Hide storage is a neat feature that gives you a nice flat floor with a nifty hiding place beneath. Every car should have this sort of thing! As to the driving, I enjoy the CVT personally though I can understand why drivers who prefer more input might desire a five or six speed. I certainly can't argue with the results though...my average gas mileage has been a jaw-dropping 41.5 mpg in combined highway and local driving. Seriously. I watch this stuff carefully (with my budget I have to) and this is not just accurate, it's spot-on. Those are near hybrid numbers, at what, a half of the cost? A third? Remarkable! Mind you, I drive with a balloon foot mostly, but hey, I stay out of the way and don't slow anybody else down. I bet I could speed up a bit with little loss in mileage, but I'd rather be kind to the car. The small fuel tank probably helps too, holding about 2.5 gallons less than the 2011 Versa. Less gas, less weight. Less range too, you would think, but at 41.5 mpg you're talking 450 miles per tank, and that's more than the 2011 ever got. The steering is precise on the road but remarkably light in the parking lot...nothing to complain about there. The car mags all note the supposedly gutless engine, but hey, it gets me up to speed just fine and I don't have any problem keeping up. So far as costs go, apart from gas, regular oil changes, and rotating tires, the Versa would be frugal on that score too. In the summing up, as a used vehicle, fleet or otherwise, the Versa Note is a remarkable bargain, proof that you don't have to give up much to gain a lot of value. I expect to be driving it for many years to come.",5

No, the car is not any high performance vehicle with all the bells and whistles but it is affordable. I had test driven the same car with the CVT transmission and was very disappointed but I do like my 5-speed manual very much. The manual version is much peppier than the CVT counterpart and has no problem getting up to 70mph when getting on the highway. It was my first manual car and was very easy to drive and continues to get better the more the vehicle breaks in. I would say that giving this car a low rating is unfair if it is based off of interior design alone because it is not meant to be a luxury car. For what it is, the car is very nice and I will continue to say that so long as I own it.",5

940, on 08/19/16 21:46 PM (PDT),Erik ,2016 Nissan Versa Note  1.6 SV 4dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl CVT),Great for parking garage.," Forgive the wall, I'm on mobile.So got this as a rental, it looked cool and I wanted to try it. It had just over 2k milkes and I put 350 miles on it. Did a bit of city ( vegas!!) freeway and some ""mountain"" driving.   Let's point out the Pros of this. The blue tooth is simple and easy, and you can take it a step further by downloading an app. But I just used Google maps, which only works if you have the stereo on Bluetooth mode) Its great for parking, tight turns, great for those u turns, braking, and decent fuel economy. The steering response is middle of the road, maybe a bit above because the car doesn't roll if you have to jerk it over to the next lane. It does have a back up camera and you can see all around when in traffic. I didn't get a chance to see how well The traction control worked. The A/C did okay for 110F heat and no window tint. Meaning it was on full blast 95%, even when it was under 100F. The audio system sounded better then I imagined! Weaving in and out of traffic is a breeze, and you'll have plenty of room. Its not the ugliest or boring for a compact. There was plenty of room for just the two of us.  The dash is nice to look at and the double glove box was very convenient. Heck the knee one was very deep. Seating was firm but comfy. Combine the seating and suspension for a sporty feel.     Now the cons; even if you are at the front of the line at a stop light, you'll be last. Not only is take off unnaturally slow, the actual throttle response is about a whole second behind. Then after that you'll start to crawl forward ( no need to worry about burn outs!)  This can actually be annoying because if traffic speeds up a tad while rolling down the road it'll be a few before you'll catch up. It was amazing that it could go 70mph ( okay there were times we may have went 85mph but we were just keeping with the flow!! And the ride was challenging due to the swaying. Well get to that later) Imagine you are getting on the freeway, you hit the Apex and pin the throttle, the rpms jump up and as need to start merging, desperately, you look down and realize you are only doing 55-60mph, pending if the hill was in your favor. Okay you get it, accerleration is not what this car is meant to do. But you may think this can hold its speed. I mean come on, it's modern, it has a CVT, and it's small! Well sure it can. But only if it's minor. If you start climbing a little it'll rev up. And if it's a 6% grade, you might want to take the slow lane with the truckers.  So how does it handle? Well on a flat road it's perfect, that goes for the pavement. If it's concrete with slits you'll start swerving like a tractor trailer with high cross winds, sad part is it's only a slight over exaggeration. At around 50mph it becomes noticeable. Maybe it's a safetly feature to keep you paying attention!  I too thought maybe someone hit something. But seeing another versa I had to follow and see if they did the dance, and they did.  With all the negative I wrote, I really do not hate this car!  Sure it's gutless, the road surface can be a challenge, and the suspension is borderline cheap feeling, but it was fun! The only way I would own this was if I got it with 6sp and 30 more ponies. ( I do kick my self for not getting the fiat 500!)",3
941, on 08/05/16 13:30 PM (PDT),David Allin ,2016 Nissan Versa Note  1.6 SL 4dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl CVT),"Fun to drive, great mileage"," First, the Versa Note is almost totally unrelated to the other Versa models.  It's a different platform that is more solid and much better looking.  When you close the doors, you hear a nice muffled 'thunk', not the tinny clank of most economy cars.  The whole car feels very tight, and is extremely quiet inside, with no squeaks or rattles and little tire and wind noise.  The interior is simple, but the materials all feel sturdy and look attractive, which is standard for Nissans.  I traded in a 2005 Sentra with 108K miles, and the cloth interior of that car still looked just like new.  The Note's interior is very spacious, especially for such a small car, with plenty of leg room in the back seats for two adults.  The cargo area is adequate, with a floor that can be positioned at two heights, and the rear seatbacks fold down almost flat.  Unlike most cars these days, the rear side windows roll all the way down and out of sight in the doors.  The car handles extremely well, and stops on a dime.  In order to make it good great mileage, however, Nissan put a very small engine in it, combined with a CVT transmission that is programmed to save gas.  As a result the car is not a pocket rocket, although the acceleration is adequate.  Going up Nine-Mile hill at 75mph with the AC on is a strain, but otherwise the car can keep up with traffic pretty well.  I've found that a gentle pressure on the gas pedal will actually result in better acceleration than pushing it to the floor.  Still, we use our Murano for long trips, and the Note in town, where it scoots around happily.  There's an old sports car saying that it's more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow, and it applies here.  I bought the SL, with all the bells and whistles, and for the most part they are worth the extra cost.  The satellite radio is great, and the car's sound system is better than the one in my Murano.  One of the main features we were looking for was visibility, and in addition to the great arrangement of windows, the SL has the around-view monitor, with cameras on all sides that produce a picture on the center screen of a birds-eye view of the car when backing up.  The cameras can also be turned on when pulling forward into a parking space.  The navigation systems is okay, but not as good as my Garmin, and clearly has not been updated for at least four years.  The Sirius Travel Link is a nice feature, giving you the prices of gas at nearby stations, movie listings in the area, stock prices, and weather info.  It also provides you real-time traffic alerts.  All of these can be accessed using voice commands that work fairly well.  Instrumentation is limited to tach, speedo, and gas gauge; all other systems are just warning lights.  The HVAC is the same one that was in my 2005 Sentra, but it works well.  Judging by our experience with previous Nissans over the last 20 years, we expect this car to be trouble-free for as long as we own it.  Yes, I wish it had a little more power, but we love the car anyway.  UPDATE:  After owning and driving the car for ten months, my previous praise still stands.  I'm averaging 31-39 mpg, depending on type of driving, and have had absolutely no problems with the car.  I have learned how to modulate the accelerator to achieve better acceleration; a steady, firm but moderate pressure on the gas pedal allows the CVT to spool up properly and bring the car to speed quickly.  You can't accelerate by the sound of the engine or the sweep of the tach like most cars; instead you just watch the speedometer and let the CVT figure out how to best move the car forward.   Driving this way has made me far less aware of the limited power of the engine.   I always enjoy driving the car, and it really scoots around town, while cruising comfortably on the highway.  It's a fun car, but also practical and totally reliable.",5

I walked into the dealership with the idea that I wanted an SUV, because I needed more room for my growing family. I had been driving around a 1999 Toyota Corolla for 6 years, and wanted to upgrade to something with more space. Fuel efficiency was still important to me, though, so I had my sights set originally on a new Nissan Rogue (33 mpg hwy). However, the minute I drive the Versa I knew it was exactly what I had been looking for! The S model was a bit basic for me, so I upgraded to the SV which includes power locks and windows, full screen radio, and a backup camera. Not only does this little car out-do my beloved Corolla in gas mileage, but its a surprisingly smooth ride! Visibility and handling  are excellent....I actually test drove my new car on a snowy Denver afternoon and was blown away by how well it performed. The brakes are very sensitive, which I love as a mom with kiddos in the backseat. The seats in the SV have an upgraded cloth, and the comfort level is reflective of that. My 6'2"" husband can fit comfortably in the front AND back seats. It's crazy how much room is in this car! The back seats fold down, so with the hatchback I can pack everything from a Christmas tree to camping gear without issues. As for the interior design, I will say that the S model did have a bit of a chintzy feel to it, but the SV interior feels much more quality. At only a thousand dollars more, it was a necessary upgrade! The only thing that I do find slightly off putting is the delayed acceleration of this car. For me though, this is probably a good thing because it keeps me from being too much of a speed racer! For the value, I would say this is an excellent vehicle, especially for commuters who need efficient fuel economy. I purchased my vehicle with an extended warranty, as this is my first Nissan and to my knowledge this brand is not quite to the level of Honda or Toyota in terms of reliability yet. For Denver shoppers, I highly recommend purchasing from Larry H. Miller Nissan on 104th Avenue. Their staff (service, sales, and finance) are top-notch professionals. My buying experience was hands down the best I have ever had with any car, and if this car proves to be as reliable as expected then I am officially a Nissan driver for life.",4

It was a 2017 Leftover and Love the Monarch Orange Color. My wife has a 2105 Rogue and really like that, but wanted something a little smaller. Had it a month and very impressed with the handling and how quiet it is. While the Motor isn't the Nismo's, it still has good pickup and very smooth shifting. Ride is similar to the Rogue, and 100% better than the Juke, and we both have commented about how well it rides whether Highway or City! It's an SL and only lacks the Platinum Package, which for me would have only wanted the Sunroof, as all the Lane/Driver assist features weren't anything I really cared for.

It's been 6 months and we are noticing that the cvt transmission is already having issues.

Purchased the car off the show room floor with only 47 miles. Barely have driven the car. Got in it and it wouldn't start. Tried everything!!! My husband goggled what it could be and it told him how to start it. Immediately, called the dealership and was told to bring it in. Took it in, hooked it up and immediately, it read transmission.

There are so many more issues I can't even start. Two service people at Courteous Nissan will not even deal with my car. They ignore me like I'm a plague. I'm so tempted to trade in my car, but it would be my issue because I would be the one upside down on payment. I have more miles on my Rogue driving it back and fourth to the dealership. The foreman had my car for a whole week nothing was done. He drove it to his home 2 days to Forney.  The tint on my car started to bubble. They fixed it but now it leaks.

949, on 04/25/18 08:58 AM (PDT),Charlie Gardner ,2017 Nissan Rogue Sport  SL 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Avoid This Car," Purchased in Feb 2018.  My review shows that Nissan USA and the local dealership failed to respond to my complaints about this car. The only good thing about it is the LED headlights are super.  From there it only goes downhill.  There is excessive road noise, so much so that with the radio on you can't hear the warning beeps for the blind spot or lane departure.  The Intelligent Lane Intervention, an oxymoron, is a joke and functions so poorly that it is actually unsafe.  It misses the lane departure without a warning on occasion and wanders so far over the lane as to be unsafe, before it reacts. Nissan USA and Local dealership were notified of this defect in writing and never got a response from either.  So much for Customer Support!  The Econ button is located below the dash and has to be activated every time when starting the car. Doesn't stay on.  The ""premium"" radio is terrible.  Very poor muddy sound.  The ride is very rough and stiff and is noisy regardless of road condition.  This is the top of the line for this model and it misses the mark badly, though it does have a nice sporty look that is very deceiving!  My advice is look elsewhere for a small SUV and stay away from Nissan.  Too many good cars by Honda and Toyota that put this car to shame.",1
950, on 04/21/18 09:52 AM (PDT),Dee M ,2017 Nissan Rogue Sport  S 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Will Never Buy Nissan Again," Where to start. First I will say it does get great gas mileage and is excellent in the snow but that is all the good I can say. I bought my Rouge Sport in October of 2017 and since the beginning it has been a problem. I start my car on cold days and about 10 minutes later get in and it's a cold as when I started it. It takes a couple of miles of driving before it starts to warm up. The heat starts to get warm, but not warm like it should and the needle will start to move to warm then a few miles down the road the heat starts to blow cool again and the needle has gone from warm back down to cold. I have had this car in a million times, have pictures of each stage w/o the the mileage and time in the picture and they swear it is normal. I have gone to Nissan cooperate since the dealership just does not get it and gives me a hard time. They had me go to another dealer and a Nissan tech came and of course it is normal. I do not think it is normal for your car to go from warm to cold again. I have also had a horrible clunk under the car when I go from the break to the gas again (someone heard it when I was stopped by them then took my foot off the break and went to the gas again and said something is loose under your car) but according to them it is normal and they even tried to tell me the clunk is in the engine.  Now onto the jerking/pulsating the car does when I am driving at 50 or higher and especially going up the hills/mountains it does it really bad. Again nothing.  There problem is if they can not duplicate the problem or it does not show on the computer they are to lazy to look into it further.  Well needles to say I have filed against Nissan with the lemon law and we go to court in November. And I will say save your time calling cooperate cause they do not care and will not help. I had to be a pain in the butt to get help. This process has been going on since the beginning of December ( mind you I got the car in October) and I still have a long way to go. It can take almost a year to resolve. I will never buy a Nissan again!",2
951, on 04/05/18 17:52 PM (PDT),Bob Snead ,2017 Nissan Rogue Sport  SL 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl CVT),This  is a GOOD Rogue," This Rogue Sport is all I ever wanted in my SUV. The power is adiquate, but the interior road noise is very low at highway speeds. The gas milage is acceptable, but the technology is really ahead of the CR-V, and the Nissan wins again in the ""looks"" department over Honda. You won't be sorry if you buy this vehicle.",5

Was skeptical due to the horrible characteristics of the Previous continuously variable transmission I experienced in an Audi and a Honda. I was talked into trying out a loaded Rogue Sort AWD, I loved the looks and much to my surprise the driving characteristics of this type transmission were much better than the Audi or Honda I tested. The seats are probably best in the class for comfort (at least for me) and I was surprised at how much room was inside the Sport, back seat holds 3 adults pretty well. Overall the inside seems really wide compared to the HR-V and the Audi q3. The “luxury “ appointments are also quite nice, so far the fit, finish and quality seem good. Love the panoramic roof and piano black trim. The sound system and fuel mileage seem average. The Sport is not “sporty” but I do think it is sport(ier) than the regular Rogue, which I also tested. Overall we are enjoying this vehicle.",5
953, on 03/19/18 21:10 PM (PDT),T. Anderson ,2017 Nissan Rogue Sport  SL 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Two thumbs up to Rogue Sport," This is not a luxury SUV, nor a race car. So don’t expect to compare it to those things. What this is, is a fully capable small SUV that does most everything right, with semi luxurious appointments, very comfortable seats and a roomy interior. The Rogue sport handles and brakes very well, has good road stability and decent ground clearance. The only negative is the CVT transmission. It’s better than most CVT’s but still zaps some fun out of a pretty decent powertrain. The ride and noise are slightly better than average for the class, the gas mileage is decent, we average 29 combined driving, 33 on long highway trips. I find the looks more appealing than the standard Rogue, people often compliment and say it looks a nicer and sportier than the regular Rogue. Overall we are satisfied with the Rogue Sport!",5
954, on 02/27/18 14:00 PM (PST),Diane from Nashville ,2017 Nissan Rogue Sport  SL 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Worst car ever so please consider something else.," I bought my Rogue Sport at the end of August and by the end of October is started having problems with the Forward Emergency Braking.  While driving on multiple occasions, the car would apply the brakes for no reason and without a car anywhere around me.  I took my car into service dept. at Downtown Nissan in Nashville where they could not find a problem.  I started a case with Nissan USA and they did testing and sent out an inspector and still found nothing. I took the car back home after them having it 58 days because Nissan USA could not find the problem.  Beware, Nissan does not care about their customers!!  If they did, they would not of put me back on the road in my UNSAFE CAR. Now, I have a crashing of 2 cars symbol flashing on my dash at intermittent time but again Nissan can not find anything wrong with it. Once again, they can not duplicate the problem so as far as they are concerned there is no problem.  Guess what?  I have multiple videos of this happening while driving but that is not good enough for them.  It is not my problem that they can't find the problem.  By the way, I am aware of someone else in Alabama with the exact same problem.  Please do yourself a favor and purchase other than the Rogue Sport or you might just have the same problem.  Remember, if you do purchase and have problems, chances are Nissan USA will not help you either.",1

It has been a nightmare!! 2000 miles the dash display panel went haywire. mpg stopped working, gas hand wouldn't move. Nissan fixed it. The BIGGEST problem has been the surgiung/slipping when you reach around 50 mph. You feel a constant rocking motion in the car around town. If you have a heavy foot you won't feel it as bad but if you drive around town, or without flooring the gas pedal it is a TERRIBLE ride!! Nissan updated the motor & transmission but states ""it's a normal feature of the car""  No one in our family can ride in this car without getting car sick do to the constant rocking on and off accelerating feeling. Nissan said contact consumer affairs there's nothing more we can do. The technicians agree the can feel it but since there is no known repair we are stuck.

Very pleased so far. Interior and exterior styling appeal to my taste while also being well designed for versatile function. Some touches and refinements add to the vehicle's appeal such as leather surfaces, quite ride, intuitive infotainment and Bluetooth controls, and clever exterior camera system. Interior comfort and quite ride (especially at highway speeds) far exceed my modest expectations for a compact. Power is adequate, handling is pleasant, CVT is smooth, ride is firmish, and gas mileage is good. Perhaps the negative comments on performance in some reviews pertain to the more common AWD versions here in the Northeast. Nissan should improve the support of the cloth seats in S/SV models.",5
959, on 01/06/18 14:13 PM (PST),Chris M ,2017 Nissan Rogue Sport  S 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),"Underpowered, Comfortable, Affordable"," Purchased a year-end 2017 Rogue Sport last month. I was looking for something with a bit more room and a bit more comfort than my previous car (an Elantra GT hatchback). I was tired of driving a manual transmission car in the city (my dog was *really* tired of it).  It's only been 500 miles, but I really think I've made a good choice. The interior is much better than I'd expect from a sub-$20k vehicle. The fuel economy is quite good. The handling . . . well, it's not sporty, but it's nowhere near as dreary as I was afraid it might be. You can also change the level of power steering assist, if you prefer a heavier feel. The one downside, and it is a CLEAR downside, is the engine. There's putting it nicely -- the Rogue Sport is seriously underpowered. I don't write that because I think every vehicle on the road needs to be a twin-turbo, twin-exhaust racer. The Rogue Sport doesn't need a 240hp turbo. But it needs more than than a 140hp 2.0 liter. My unsolicited advice would be to use a 1.6 or 1.8l turbo in the base model(s), for a bit more torque, and use either a 2.0l turbo or the 2.4l engine from the regular Rogue in the higher trim levels. Then we might be in 5-star territory. As it is, the Rogue Sport is very good . . . *if* you can deal with the engine. 4 stars.",4

There is more value in the SL trim level as well when compared to the highest EX-L trim level on the Honda HR-V. For the roughly the same price you get all the features of the Honda plus: 19 in alloy wheels, 360 degree camera with moving object detection, dual climate control, and a heated steering wheel.

Nissan should include some features in the mid range SV line like the Honda does in their HR-V. To get heated seat one has to pony up near a grand with the cold weather package. Apple Car Play and a 7 inch screen are missing. Honda adds in some safety feature Nissan omits, such as a blind spot camera when you flip the trun signal for right hand lane change. Under heavier acceleration the the under powered 4 cyc really starts to show. Road noise is excessive at higher speeds on the interstate. Add in the fact that Nissan makes you buy your mats on a 25 K car seems like they are chiseling you for every buck. Nissan !...drop the Juke 4cyc.

The above review is foolish. Nissan is a very reliable brand. My family all drive Nissans and have had good experiences with them all.

So the Sport is smaller, lighter and has a smaller engine with less horsepower and then it gets lower fuel economy than the Rogue?

My Nissan Rogue is only two months old. I took the car to the dealership and they said that something might have hit it. My thing is that for a car that is supposed to be so good it should take more that a pebble (the dealership said it could be that) to crack a window. Obviously it would not be cover by warranty . I am really unsatisfied with the Nissan and needless to say that this would be my last one .

This is your car.  When I am driving around I am always happily surprised to see another Z car. I get massive compliments everywhere! I changed out my emblems and some people think it's a Porsche. Mustangs, Camaros, Challengers are everywhere, nothing special, they also can't keep up with me on the road course. They may get me in the 1/4 mile but curves they can't handle. The trunk is pretty sparse in size but I still manage to put $180 of groceries back there. There is the road noise but my passengers don't complain as much as I do. I could fix it but that would add weight and I do race a 12+ times every year. Plenty of upgrades available but most speed upgrades are more costly than Chevy, Ford. I have had it for almost 2 years and the only issue I had was a leaking gasket the had my seatbelts getting wet after hard rain, they fixed it and it's only a 2016 issue.

I didn't purchase this car for fuel economy, cargo space, a soft suspension or a back seat. I wanted something I could get excited about every time I got behind the wheel.. and the 370z Nismo fits the bill! No.. this is not a V8 Mustang or Camaro, but the V6 has great acceleration and the handling is out of this world! The steering and suspension are very responsive. I'm fortunate to have a company vehicle for my weekly work commute so I can't speak to what it would be like to use as a daily driver, but I will say that I constantly find myself looking for reasons to go for a ride. I love the fact that there are not that many Nismo's on the road so it feels like a pretty exclusive club. As far as the bang for my buck.. I don't think I would've paid $43k-$45k for a new one, but I found a 2016 with just over 10k for just $28,600! I got lucky because the BMW dealer where I purchased the car had just dropped the price before sending the car to auction (every where else I looked with similar mileage were going for $31k-$34k). The exterior design is absolutely gorgeous and the interior is just as nice. The Recaro bucket seats a very comfortable. I'm 6' and 200 lbs and I can get in and out of the car with ease.

979, on 10/27/17 02:50 AM (PDT),Douglas Tucker ,2016 Nissan 370Z  NISMO Tech 2dr Coupe (3.7L 6cyl 6M),"Like to drive? You'll love it in a ""Z"" !"," I have owned two 370 Z's (a Sport and a Nismo Tech) and am amazed that everyone who can do without a back seat doesn't drive one (or hire a babysitter). These cars are truly amazing. I have a 120 mile daily commute in Colorado and Wyoming and drive my Z year round (winter tires October through March) and actually look forward to my commute, every single day. I have driven in blizzards and 80mph gusts and with the snow tires on it isn't even a challenge (though I don't recommend the base model for winter driving as there is no limited slip diff). The 370 Z is absolutely amazing and the value you get for the price (sport around 32k) seems like a steal. If you have the money the Nismo is worth it (it is so much more that an extra few HP).  I gave the car 4/5 overall rating only because many looking for a ""Driver's car"" are not willing to accept the sacrifices that a true sports car / driver's car makes to achieve the level of adrenaline pumping fun the Z-car elicits. However,  if you understand this is an unapologetic track-capable machine focused entirely on making your driving fun, exciting, and a form of entertainment rather than a chore, than this is the car for you (and is undoubtedly 5/5). The 370Z is absolutely one of the purest driver cars (maybe the purest driver's car) under 100k in the world today. That being said - a driver's car is sporty and the focus is on performance and the driving experience. It is about full engagement,  and if this is not what your looking for -  this car is not for you (thus the 4/5 overall rating). If your looking for a drivers car for weekend outings or as a very capable and fun daily driver, (and don't carry kids and cargo much) then this is a 5/5 driver car for you. Nothing, however is perfect and there are issues that one should expect before even considering this vehicle. Mainly you must recognize that this car is not big. If you are into super big gulps and cruising with the wife and kids.... think again, the kids get kicked to the curb. Cargo space s limited, and even glove box and console space is at a premium. There is no back seat and the enormous tires/wheel wells and stabilizer bar eat up much of the back hatch storage and there is only one small cup holder; which when you have your best girl (or guy) in the car with you, can be a bit cumbersome. Getting in and out of the car can require a bit of human origami at times; as its stance and seating positions are quite  low (as a sports car should be). Further, the ride is firm (though not ever unpleasant or wearisome) and the car tracks the road like a blood hound which does actually require a high level of focus when driving much above 90-95MPH. Finally, the rear visibility is just poor (but the car is oh so beautiful). Having said all of this, these issues are only issues if you are expecting this tiny unapologetic drivers car to be something else.  I find the car extremely comfortable with plenty of headroom (I am 6 foot tall), and the seats (once your in them) are the most comfortable I've ever sat in (Nissan sport bucket or Ricaro racing depending upon your trim package). Pedal placement is perfect. The steering is on the heavy side, but in the very best way - with excellent feedback, quality material feel and mounted controls. Many reviews call the design ""long in the tooth"" as it has not been redesigned in about 9 years, but honestly I don't think this is true - if someone didn't know it, this car would pass for a 2018 design. Inside and out, this car is beautiful and well designed. It is a truly amazing performer keeping up with cars twice its price with 0-60 in around 5s (depending upon trim) and an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph (with lots of rpm left when there) and it starts at under 30k, making it an amazing value as well.

When my lease is up I plan to purchase her or lease the 2019.  Drove her to Las Vegas and on the open highway she handles the curves like a dream.  The Z is simply GREAT EYE CANDY, I get lots of looks and comments.  My mechanic says its one of the most reliable sports cars on the market.  He went on to say that the Z almost never breaks down and if it is towed its more than likely been in an accident.   It roomy to me, back in 2003, weighed almost 300 pounds and have very long legs and I had enough room.  Now with the 2016 and weighing only 145 pounds it's more than enough room.

It IS a joy to drive. I got the stick shift model. It is a fast, ""purty"", little thing.  I did my homework before I even stepped inside the dealership and would recommend you do the same.  I drove 100 miles away to get nearly $7,000 off what the other dealers were selling her for.  She only had 19 miles on her when I drove her off the lot. I used Edmunds.com and Truecar.com to get online estimates and made sure the Internet Rep of the dealerships honored their bid.  Obviously, this car being a two seater sports car you are not going to have a lot of cargo storage space, but look, I don’t plan on using her to haul baggage.  She does pick up alot of road noise via the tires and sitting so low to the ground but if you are listening to the BOSE stereo system or Sirrius XM you learn to love the sound.  All in all, I am extremely pleased with this purchase. MPH is about the same as my last car G6, nothing stupendous to write home about. And she uses only premium gas (91) so consider how much you can afford for gas as in California we pay the highest amount for gasoline. By the way, I am a single female, with no minor children. I bought this car, not out of practicality, but because I wanted her. She is gorgeous to look at and people (men especially) stop to tell me so. This car hugs the turns and picks up speed fast.

This leaves the Z in a weird place it cost about the same as those improved cars, but lacks the refinements those cars received with their respective updates. I owned a 300Z during my early college years and loved it, the gauges, the performance, the looks there Z captured my attention. When the 350Z made its triumphant return to America I was intrigued, the performance and look checked two boxes on my checklist, the interior felt so cheap and bad that I left the dealer disgusted. I don't know how people justified the price when you were being sold an interior that Kia, or Hyundai wouldn't put on their cars because it was too cheap. So I waited, then the 370Z came along, the performance improved, the interior was incredible (compared to the 350z). The only problem I proudly was driving an MKV GTi, so I waited, once I had the money, and driven my faithful GTi to 100k miles, I could justify the swap. I bought my 370Z, the trim, color and options I wanted, found one on the next largest town over and argued all Saturday until a price was met all sides could accept. I am tall, 6'1"" 185#s and fit in the car fine, admittedly I push the seat as far back, as low and tilted back as it will go and fit snugly. The steering wheel only adjust in height, telescoping would be nice but is not included. The radio is very basic, it has Bluetooth for calls, and if you hook your USB to an iPhone, it will let you play music as well. The climate controls are straightforward and given the cars extremely small cabin work effectively it takes little time to warm or cool. The rear hatch is not for storage, you can fit a couple small pieces of luggage for a weekend getaway but this car will not help you move from one apartment to another let alone a house (of you don't mind moving 1 box at a time maybe... No just rent a truck if you need to move stuff)I would never suggest anyone visit Nissan of Boerne in San Antonio, the sales rep and manager will leave your very angry, I disclosed these concerns with their customer care and am happy I have many dealers I can visit instead of them. If you only want performance, the Z isn't your car, it's great but needs an update, if you want looks, performance, and only 2 seats then try a Z, the smile I had test driving it I still put on every day that I continue to drive it.",4
986, on 04/08/16 11:15 AM (PDT),John Hall ,2016 Nissan 370Z  2dr Coupe (3.7L 6cyl 6M),Everything but the seats," 2016 is late in the model life of the 370Z, and it appears Nissan has worked out all the bugs and the Z has become a very reliable vehicle.   The Sport Tech model has all the bells and whistles a person could need.  Handling is great with very brisk acceleration and steering.  The 370Z is the perfect evolution of the famous Nissan Z line.After the first two weeks and 500 miles, I took the Z on a 2900 mile 4 day trip.  Weither cruising the Interstate at 80MPH or winding through the mountains of North Carolina, the Z performs flawlessly.  The tires are somewhat noisy but a throaty exhaust easily compensates.    As much as I like this vehicle, I am extremely disappointed with the seats!  A $40k vehicle and both front seats are crappy, mechanical ones expected in a vehicle a third the price.  The seats are also so narrow and uncomfortable only a teenager could be comfortable in them.  When I was shopping, I didn't even ask about power memory seats; I just assumed they were standard for the price.  If my trade hadn't already been sold, this would have killed the deal.  I was told power memory seats weren't necessary in this type of sports car and by opting for manual seats they save space and weight.   No, its a bean counter's way to cut cost.  Every valet, every car wash, every mechanic has to crank the seat to suit THEM and I it seems to take me forever to get the seat adjusted to my comfort again.  Every other vehicle I've owned the past 20 years has had power memory seats; push a button and its all back to my setting.   Even the 370Z Roadster has power seats.",4

We love the style being old Datsun 240 fans, performance, power, ride quality, comfort and price. We purchased a 2016 Magma sport tech. Everyone loves this color and style. I hear that the 370Z model is getting old and this may be, but don't overlook this car because of that. It's a proven sports car and a blast from the past to drive.",5

My 2014 grey 370z roadster is an absolute superstar. It is  stunning to look at. I am shocked when i go a single day without compliments or admiring glances. The power is awesome. The engine sound is brutal, in a good way. The handling and braking are true sportscar. It is absolutely reliable and the oil changes are the same price as a sentra. And I paid $38,900 for my base roadster. Now in a two seat sportscar, what car on this planet does what the Z does ??.A corvette roadster for $55,000?. A boxster for $ 60,000?..And don't make me laugh By even mentioning a miata or an FRS. And by the way, a mustang is NOT a Z competitor!, that competes with camaros and challengers, and phony auto journalists should know that. The Z is unique in the price range, and it is an excellent true sportscar!",4

The Zs are fun to drive, incredibly reliable, and relatively safe for sports convertibles. You could buy two of these cars for what you might pay for a  Porsche.  The Bose sound system is crystal clear, and the road sound dampening improvements in the 2016 cars are a real plus.",5
992, on 10/31/15 19:18 PM (PDT),Joey L ,2016 Nissan 370Z  Touring Sport 2dr Convertible (3.7L 6cyl 6M),My fourth Z and the best so far," Since I have bought four of these so far, you can safely assume I think highly of this car.  Since I have had such good luck with previous models I bought this sight unseen and assumed it would be OK.  It has been a great experience so far.  (Only 2 months).   I have always relied on a Z for basic commuting.  I only need to bring myself and a briefcase so a 2-seater is ideal.  They have all been nimble and quick, even the 300ZX.  The direct comparison I will make is to the 350Z that I just traded in.  First I assume it will be a good resale value because I got back much more than I expected for a ten year old 350Z.  ($7500!)The experience is overall the best yet.  The 370 is the quickest yet,  But: The 350 was made to be faster with a lighter push on the accelerator, giving the impression of being quicker.  With the same amount of pedal travel, the 370 accelerates less quickly.  However, about pushing half way down it clearly is quicker than the 350.  Flooring it really shows it to be MUCH quicker from 0 to 40 or so.  And a lot louder too.    The steering is very precise, but the steering wheel moves with a very light touch, easier than any past Z. The interior feels very similar to the 350 with a few upgrades.  The seat, although manual, fits me like a glove.  There is a much better layout of storage areas.  The 350 had no glovebox, and the 370 does and has rear storage areas also.  The USB connector is in the center console storage box. Unfortunately the interior lights are all regular incandescents which I hate since they can kill the battery if left on.  I changed 5 of them out for LED lights.  You can find these for a few bucks on Amazon.  I was initially unhappy about paying for the upgraded Bose stereo in the sport package (you have no choice if you want the larger brakes and viscous slip differential).  However I must say it sounds better than I expected, and better than the Bose stereo that came with past Zs.  But not nearly as good as the premium systems in either the BMW 335 or the Grand Cherokee which I have experienced long-term.  I like the exterior much better:  it looks muscular and aggressive.  And they got rid of the shark tooth front.  The LED running lights are decent looking as well.  There are not many of these cars around and I am just fine with that.  There are 100 BMWs and mercedes and vettes and porsches for every Z that I see and I don't care.  I love the way this car looks and I can afford a 911.  I just think it's nuts to toss out $100 k on a car.  In fact I see more GT-Rs than Zs around here. The brakes are much better than past models.  I have the sport model with larger discs and they slow the car very well for street driving.  One point to make, the rear visibility is not so hot.  I perceive a pretty big blind spot on the two rears, so if you have problems looking over your shoulder, this might not be a good choice for you.  I can make up for it by altering my position in the car to look with the side mirrors.  Bottom line:  This car is an unqualified bargain for $34k.  If I live long enough I will get the 390Z or 400Z or whatever the next one is named.  Update: After having this car for 2 years, I would say there is only one thing that has become a problem for me: Non-Linear Accelerator pedal.  For lack of a better term, this is how I describe it. There is a ""dead spot"" in the middle 1/3 of the pedal travel which is mainly noticeable when you are already going about 30-40mph, and you try to accelerate by pressing down a significant amount, about halfway down, and almost nothing happens.  It accelerates a tiny bit, but barely.     Then you keep inching the pedal down and then suddenly it downshifts 2 gears and wails off like like a rocket with much more intense acceleration.  Other reviewers have called it a ""slow to downshift"" situation. This is a silly way of programming the pedal.  It is so goofy that at those speeds I just shift to manual mode and shift it myself.  I wish they could re-program this.  My dealer has no idea what I'm talking about.  I still like this car, and keeping it in manual shifting will make it liveable,",4

I've always bought 3-4 year old cars in the past and I must say I love this automobile the most out of all of them.

This is my 3rd Honda, always seem to come back to the Honda. The 2017 Accord Sport SE is a great value for the money.  I love the exterior and interior styling. The exterior resembles a BMW 5-Series in my opinion without the price tag and high maintenance costs of a German car.  I seriously considered the Volkswagen CC but practicality lead me to back to the Honda once again.  I also considered the 2018 Honda Accord but liked the lines and styling of the 2017 much more. I contemplated paying another $1K for the leather but it was well worth the extra money.  The leather seats are like butter! Don't skimp on the leather seats!  That's the one point I want to emphasize. Go with the leather! What really caught my interest at first were the low profile tires and the wheels! The wheels on the Sport Edition are second to none.  They bring the car together. I highly recommend this vehicle for the cost conscious, low maintenance /no hassles, style conscious car owner.  You will not be disappointed.

I do like the Garmin based navigation, although I have found no way to make it stay on a particular scale, or automatically go to ""night mode"" - you have to push the buttons. The Garmin navigation and standard features of the infotainment system, make Apple Car Play and Honda Link redundant. I don't like the design of the console, arm rest, cup holder combination, which is partly due to the hand lever parking break taking up much of the real estate of the console. Storage space and cubby volume within the cabin is about half of what my Camry was. The trunk is adequate, but a bit smaller than the Camry. The ""premium"" sound system, with sub-woofer, is OK, but not great, compared to other premium systems I've heard. All of that said, these minor ""sins"" are more than trumped by the price I got.",4

1022, on 12/31/17 12:50 PM (PST),Patricia C ,2017 Honda Accord  EX-L 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Downgrade from 2014 Honda Civic," Now that I've had a couple of months to experience the 2017 Honda Accord, i truly regret not buying my old 2014 Honda Civic instead of leasing this car. I had assumed future versions of a vehicle would be an upgrade, not downgrade. In terms of voice recognition, the 2014 was superior in every way. The Accord has very limited cellphone compatibility. My OnePlus phone was compatible with the 2014 Civic, but not the 2017 Accord.  In fact, the 2017 Accord supports very few manufacturers (Alcatel, Apple, Blackberry, Coolpad, HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung, ZTE), and among the manufacturers, very few models, except for Samsung and LG. I don't know why they're favoring Korean manufacturers, but there it is. Even Google is not on the list.  Unless your phone is on the list, you can't use the voice dialing feature at all. The calling process is now much more cumbersome. With the 2014 Civic, all you had to do was press the talk button and say the name of the person you are calling, then the phone would dial. With the Accord, you have to go through a ridiculous menu system, and that's if your phone is compatible. I find it easier to just connect to bluetooth and dial from the phone, making the process rather unsafe as compared with the 2014 Civic. The mileage is horrible on this car. i drive about 75% city, 25% highway, and the mpg averages 19.5. The Civic was smaller, but the mpg averaged 28, with 80% city and 20% highway. Being a larger vehicle, the Accord has a larger engine, and that shows in the added power. It is less responsive and less maneuverable than the Civic. The Civic would respond as soon as either the gas or brake pedals were engaged. it also had a fairly tight turning radius. The Accord, well... The best features of this car are the automatic headlights and heated leather seating. Automatic headlights are great for those who forget to turn on the headlights at night.  While the interior is roomier than the 2014 Civic (the 2017 Civic is larger), the one item I wish they would change is enlarge the center storage console, which has been reduced in size. I use that storage area more often than I would the glove compartment due to proximity to the driver's seat. If the cellphone issue isn't restored to something similar to the 2014 Civic (all new Hondas have the same cellphone system) in the next 3 years, this will likely be the last Honda I'll ever lease.",3

Honda Reliability, style, price all worth the money. I have owned two Hondas and one Acura and I couldn't be happier with my new purchase. I think if your honest with yourself what you're getting for between 25-32K is worth it. I'm sure if you need all the bells and whistles you're probably considering luxury with the luxury price tag and maintinence cost. I'm practical and drive 100miles per day so with that being said I went with coupe V6  because it's usually just me back and fourth to work. I chose V6 over CVT because I like the extra power and don't care for the ticking in the CVT. That being said the coupe is a dieing breed and since this was Honda's last year for the coupe and 6 cylinder, I let go of the 2002 Honda Accod at 250k miles and upgraded. The two screens is a little much, but I love the seat warmers, memory setting, Bluetooth, and a decent sound system. I live in the Bay Area, so mild wheather conditions, but crappy roads,  but front wheel drive is sufficient. Gas mileage could be better but at 25mpg, I'll get over it. I wish Honda would stand by their product and offer a better warranty (30k or 3 years) is shameful. I've owned for 6 months and am happy with my purchase.After owning for a year now (16k miles) I’m pretty happy with my Accord excellent ride and good re-sell value. Bluetooth could be better sometimes difficult to hear. Great car for the value.",5

AVOID HONDA Sport SE," The tires are designed to rub against a brake pad protector of some sort, which produces a loud noise that is very annoying. Honda now says it was designed into the car, after I brought the car in for repair 5 times. I think Honda is full of it and not standing behind it's cars. Who designs a car to have $1,000 tires rub? How do you say that with a straight face? STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR AND SO FAR HONDA is LEAVING MYSELF AND DEALERSHIP OUT TO DRY. I am not only appalled at the way Honda is handling this but insulted by the fact that we are suppose to read fine print in the specs now to avoid this from happening to you! THE TIRES ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR THIS CAR, THEY ARE SIMPLY TOO BIG FOR THE FRONT END. ADMOIT IT HONDA, YOU PIT 19 INCH TIRES ON A FRINT END THAT CAN ONLY HANDLE 17 INCH WHEELS.",3

The passenger side leg room is a little shy.  Interior materials are very nice and should hold up very well.  Several areas of shiny finishes will need regular cleaning to keep smudges down.  Combination cloth an faux leather seats with faux leather steering wheel, gear shift and center console cover.  Very little storage space in the interior.  The center console does not hold my wife's wallet.  No satellite entertainment an no USB ports that I've found.  CVT can feel boring for acceleration at the low end, especially in economy mode.

Now on with the review...  I have owned 2 Accords (1 Sedan and 1 Coupe), 2 Pilots and 2 CVRs before purchasing this Accord Sport Special Edition; I am a fan of the value and quality with the Honda products.  I have owned a few High-End Cars/SUVs (Audi, Range Rover and Volvo).  This Sport SE might be the most finely appointed and ergonomically featured car I have driven!!   At first glance, it might be mistaken for an Audi A4 or BMX 3 Series, nice clean, modern lines.  The performance is really good for a 4 cylinder.  The 19"" rims give this car a nice added performance look; super sharp!  The ride is pretty good, but I will recommend to any one looking for a smoother ride, go for touring edition.  But if you want the look and feel of a German car, with better reliability, then the Sport SE is the way to go!!!  I am very happy with the Sport SE, might rival my Pilot for my favorite vehicle!!",5

Loved the car, but couldn't stand the starter problem endemic to 2013-1015 V6s.  Giving Honda another chance, since I've had them since 1978.  Didn't need all the Touring extras, but it came in the colors we both agreed on.  Love the V6 power and open road economy [32-34/gal.];  mileage is only about 17+ in our local very short trips.  Love the comfortable seats - 12 hour drive to Florida no problem.  Love the backup camera, and the camera in right side mirror, which I use to monitor any open lanes to my right.  Smooth and quiet, but enough feedback from suspension to remember you're still alive and awake.  Great visibility/glass, which is what first sold me on an Accord back in '78.  Touring 40-series tires are expensive to replace-have lost two to road hazards in 6000 miles.  Top safety rating in 2013 also drew me to this model.  A genuine bargain for the power and features this car packs... paid about $4000 under sticker on this last model year, and could have done better if didn't need car deal that day.",5

From the start, the front passenger window sounds like it is not shut tight.  Makes an air leak sound.  I took it back to the dealer because I could no longer take that sound.  We travel long distances and after a few hours this noise become extremely aggravating.  The dealer took it out for a drive.  He then came back and said that he too heard the sound.  He then took another Honda out for a drive.  This one too made the same sound.  He said it appears to come from the front edge trim.  He then said there was nothing they could do.  That, I would just have to accept it.  This is unacceptable for a new car to have a 'defect'.  Needless to say, I was not in a happy place after he told me that.  Even my husband was taken aback from the lack of a solution.  I am now in the process of demanding a fix or give my money back.  We will see what happens.

These are all very minor complaints.  Everything else about the car is excellent-- absolutely top notch-- and, as a repeat Honda buyer, reaffirms why I usually buy Honda products and why the Accord is always rated as one of the best cars.  You simply cannot get a better all around car--- for more or less money-- than a Honda.  Interior comfort is excellent, the 4 cylinder engine provides plenty of power- even with multiple passengers in the car, MPG is great, and everything was delivered in perfect working condition.

1042, on 09/20/17 08:48 AM (PDT),Bart Charlow ,2017 Honda Accord  EX-L 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Near top end Honda competes with higher end cars," We compared to the Acura models and found the near top end Honda to be a much better car and deal (surprised!) While the car is brand new, given past experience with half a dozen Hondas, I expect reliability and repair needs to be excellent. Honda servicing is quite good and an Accord is much less expensive to maintain than a Lexus or Acura. This car drives very well. Much better seating and entry/exit height than previous models. Very good visibility (better than the Acura) and better ride than previous models. It's still an Accord, so it isn't really cushy, but it's tighter to handle more like a sporty car without the drawbacks of a sports car. Exterior has too much chrome for my taste, but overall looks good. Interior is well done. Controls a bit daunting at first, but well laid out. We did NOT get the navigation, as it is unnecessary with GPS on phone, but we did pony up extra for the parking lidar and it seems worth it. The automatic right turn camera is a really great feature, but cannot fathom why they didn't do it for left turns as well. Rear camera works well. Overall a very nice car with a nice ride and look. I do wish Honda gave more color choices, though.",5

The leather seat was great compared with cloth seat. The styling seemed to be more sporty than previous year model.  Handling is great.  However the ride comfort was not good.  It was very stiff compared with my son's  2014 Sport model.  I was told that because of the 19"" wheel and the tires.  In order to make the ride a little bit soft,  I was told to lower the tire pressure and it is a little bit better but not perfect.  I was told to down size the wheel to 17"" or 18"" and a bigger side wall types of tires.  I wish I had known this before my purchase.  I should have bought the LX or the EX version.

1050, on 07/18/17 15:27 PM (PDT),Andrew Kim ,2017 Honda Accord  Sport Special Edition 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Extremely impressed," I had this car for about a month now... My previous car was a hand-me-down 2004 Acura TL and, while I absolutely loved the car (and the 270 hp), the Accord blew it out of the water. I have not driven anything crazy like an M4, so my standards as far as the sound of the engine aren't too high yet. But I personally love the sound of the Accord's engine. Right amount of bass for my ears, and because its only 189hp, I can floor it without risking a speeding ticket. The exclusive Obsidian Blue you can get on the Sport SE is absolutely stunning. The only other dark blue that's comparable is on a Tesla I saw the other day. The 19"" wheels you get on the Sport SE are very similar to something you might find on a Mercedes. Using paddle shifters on a CVT is a little weird (and it has 7 gear settings, so you do have to click a lot), but it emulates the jerky feeling you get from an automatic. The interior is VERY upscale for a car of this level. The leather-wrapped steering wheel feels too much like my mom's BMW 335i M Sport steering wheel (and it feels amazing). The carbon fiber trim and piano black panels are really nice to look at, and there's padded, stitched leather everywhere. I swapped out the original halogen headlights for some really bright LEDs since that's the only thing that really holds this car back in terms of appearance. You should not be allowed to get a car with this much value at this price point. The only complaint I have is that if you drive around 12-2PM and the sun is directly above you, the instrument panel and the entertainment display get a bad glare because the sun reflects off the bottom panel and goes on the clear window, making it hard to see the speedometer and stuff. If they changed the angle of the clear window covering all the instrumentation, it might have worked better, but its a minor complaint.",5

But quickly found out that Cabin of the car is too noisy on the highway, as we have to drive more than 100 miles on the highway to get back home.  You hear the wind noise much more then normal, especially if you are sitting on the back seat, but even you hear the wind noise on the front seats.   I  complaint bout the wind noise and took my car back to the dealership and they try to adjust the doors but that didn't make any big difference.  I am wondering if anyone else has also experienced the wind noise on the highway?  It could be annoying if you are driving long distance and continuously has to  listen to the noise.    I would like to add one more thing which could add lot of comfort to the passengers sitting on the back seat to have a AC went in front of the back seat.",3

1055, on 06/11/17 15:35 PM (PDT),Nicholas Keen ,2017 Honda Accord  Sport 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6M),"Comfortable, agile, manual transmission sedan"," The 2017 Accord doesn't have the most powerful engine at this trim level, but the  slightly gruff, very responsive character of the non-turbocharged 4-cylinder has won me over. The engine loves to rev, feels alive and is your friend for a fast drive, as is the handling which is agile and sure footed as long as you feed the car some power through fast corners -- if you lift off or are timid with it, it can feel a bit twitchy and nervous. On balance I'd much sooner have this car with its absence of electronic add-ons than an option-laden front-heavy V6 that is great for freeway acceleration but doesn't have the balance of a four and is lumbered with an automatic transmission. Having come from European and U.S brands, it was refreshing to get into a new car and have simply nothing wrong with it. Best points: engine performance; handling; steering; reliability; the standard halogen headlights are very effective -- really as good as HIDs; value for money; passenger space; San Marino Red color. Worst points, minor stuff but: stereo sounds boxy and tinny with a treble bias that can't really be dialed out (lessons to be learned from GM's ability to get decent balanced sound from a modest system); Bluetooth radio streaming sometimes fails -- may be the iPhone at fault;  I'm no doubt in the minority on this but I would prefer a fully manual climate control system -- this one does not seem good at holding a comfortable temperature and airflow volume in winter when set to full auto with a setting of, say, 72 degrees (but summer A/C performance seems strong). Overall, this car does pretty much everything I care about very well and I am glad I bought it.Update at 10K miles: The car is still performing flawlessly. The manual transmission is sweet and intuitive. I recently had the opportunity to drive an LX with CVT. It was a different car entirely, well made but a bit lacking in character and the handling did not have the edge that the Sport's has. I expect that C&D is right: the Sport with manual is the sweet spot in the range. I drive a lot of country roads in winter and headlight performance matters. I feel as comfortable with the Accord's halogens as I did with the HIDs in my old BWW 325i. There is plenty of light to the sides of the road and the high beams flood the road with light. That's thoughtful design and carefully, rigorously tested implementation that many others in the U.S. market do not seem to bother themselves with.Update at 15,000 miles: one issue so far. Rear defog had one bad element, associated with poor FM radio reception when switched on. Rear window replaced under warranty, issue fixed.",5

1058, on 06/07/17 17:56 PM (PDT),Matthew Whitaker ,2017 Honda Accord  Touring V-6 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Close to Perfection," This is my second 9th gen Accord Touring, so I'm obviously a fan of Honda and this iteration of Accord.  The 2017 9.5 gen is even more refined than my 2014, with a smoother operating engine that has more seamless VCM transitions between 3 and 6 cylinders, more supple ride quality due to the reactive amplitude dampers and revised rear bushings, vastly improved and updated infotainment system with Apple CarPlay, improved, more eye-catching styling, Honda Sensing safety features, and additional luxury features, such as rain-sensing wipers, full LED headlights with auto LED highbeams and heated rear seats.  In Lunar Silver Metallic with deeply tinted windows, the car often attracts compliments.  The acceleration is outstanding and the J-series V6 is a real gem:  one of Ward's Best engines for 2014, it's smooth and rev-happy, with a mean, intoxicatingly joyous sound when worked hard into VTEC range (5100 rpm).  It makes higher trim Accords feel like a completely different beast than those powered with i4s and CVTs.  If there's any downside, it would have to be the POS Continental ProContact tires that Honda has chosen for models with 19"" wheels.  Too narrow in both width and sidewall, the tires explode at seemingly the tiniest impact, which is probably one of the reasons why such a reliable automaker now has a roadside assistance program.  Having owned my 2017 for 6 months, I speak from experience as I have now had 3 blowouts since December 2016.  At $362/tire, premature replacement of tires due to blowouts has to be the largest, if only downside to my ownership experience thus far.",4

1060, on 05/23/17 10:31 AM (PDT),Paul Y. ,2017 Honda Accord  Sport Special Edition 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Excellent and Stylish Value," I came from owning a Volvo S60 (and an Acura TL before that) wanting something reliable and practical with a premium edge. The Accord Sport Special Edition provides an amazing value proposition in a stylish package, with many pros and a few cons. I cannot get over the exterior and interior styling; Honda did an excellent job. I love the amount of space throughout the vehicle, including the large trunk, legroom, headroom and other nooks and crannies. The leather upholstery and fit and finish are great. The visibility from the interior to seeing the road all around you is also excellent - way better than my two previous vehicles. I drive a constant mix of city, suburban and interstate environments - handling and ride is a wonderful balance of responsive, agile and refined. The car feels much lighter on the road than its actual size indicates. Turning radius is great - very easy to get around parking garages, parallel spots and city streets. The rear multi-angle camera is super handy in the urban environment. My only complaints are as follows: 1) the sound system and speakers leave much to be desired, 2) sunroof should be included and standard at this price, 3) auto-dimming mirror would be nice, and 4) I personally prefer regular automatic transmissions to the CVT - the undefined gear-shifting can feel strange. Other than that, I am extremely happy with this car.",5

I've owned an Audi A4, driven A6s, A8s & MB E class.  Nice cars with beautiful cabins and great performance.  No question.  But the Honda Accord Sport SE is an unbelievable value.  The cabin is top notch.  Quality through & through with many features.  Leather interior with red stitching is a nice touch.  Leg room for the front & rear passengers is excellent.  Very comfortable for driver & passengers.  I feel that I could drive from NY to Florida and get out of the car feeling fresh as a daisy.  Trunk space is ample.  Controls are easy to use & very intuitive.  The engine is a very reliable I4, 2.4L with 189bhp.  Pickup is adequate.  It's not going to match other 4 door, 4 cylinder sedans.  But Honda is not in the performance business.  They make FAMILY vehicles.  But it would be nice if they would up the BHP to 220.  The engine is quiet and revs low.  The ride is smooth and quiet even at 70mph.  But the 19"" rims outfitted with P235/40 tires does make you feel the road more.  That may not be favorable for those who enjoy more of a soft/quiet ride.  But I don't mind it at all.  You feel the road more and true drivers like that.  The MPG is excellent and it uses regular-unleaded 87 octane fuel.  Overall this is an excellent vehicle.  For the price, it's a steal.  I don't know how Honda does it.",5

Beginning with a 2008 Avalon I noticed a downward turn in quality.  Paint quality on my 2017 Camry is poor compared to my 2004 Camry.  Interior plastic surfaces are easily scratched.  And the amount of road/wind noise is ridiculous on the highway.  But the item that confirmed the end of my Toyota loyalty, the Scout GPS connected nav app on my 2017 Camry.  It doesn't work.  Toyota has responded to tell me basically ""oh well, nothing to for us to do here"".  That attitude has been echoed by the dealership.  I realize some people would say the connected nav issue is a nit, but for me it simply confirms the direction Toyota is going.  We went outside Toyota three years ago and bought a new Honda.  Better quality, fit/finish, and much better dealer/service experience.",3

1079, on 12/28/17 09:21 AM (PST),Bill Duda ,2017 Toyota Camry  XLE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Interior designers need to go back to school," Car reliability and performance is outstanding. The interior design is horrible.  My 2004 Camry was much more comfortable.  On a test drive you spend little time to notice how comfortable you are.  To begin with getting in and out is a pain in the kiester.  My wallet always is in the way, it is too tight getting in and out and the seat is curved at the outside edge to further inhibit egress.  The steering wheel position must have been designed by a chimpanzee, if my arms are comfortably on the steering wheel my legs are all bunched up thus I need to grow my arms by 1 1/2 feet so that my legs can be comfortable.  The console pannel at the bottom is too close to the accelerator, I often find my shoe against it on a long trip. Seats too hard needs much improvement. The blower for the air/heat is positioned poorly as you must take your eyes off the road to try and find the darn thing and the noise of the blower even when off sounds like a window is partially open. To add to inconvience in order to put the back seats down to gain room in the trunk you now have to release them from the rear of the trunk instead of releasing from the inside of the car, so after you release them from outside the car you then go in the back seat to pull them down.  Not good when raining and you need access to the trunk for rain gear. The 2004 inter design in my opinion was much more eye appealing , more comfortable even though seats were too hard,  and more user friendly .",3

1081, on 11/20/17 14:14 PM (PST),David McAndrew ,2017 Toyota Camry  XLE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Consider other options," The biggest disappointment I have with this car is road noise. It seems Toyota forgot to even try to make this a quiet ride. All the road noise just bounces around the cabin making for an uncomfortable ride. The second dislike is the stereo...I have the JBL upgrade but even then it is a small sound and no speed controlled volume option on the stereo so you have to constantly adjust the volume. The steering controls for audio and car information are on the opposite side you would think it should be. The heat/air controls make you take your eyes down low off the road which is another problem. Now for some positives: gas mileage in the 4 cyl is good along with reliability. I love the larger gas tank since I drive about 47,000 miles per year. The interior is appealing and the leather seats are nice and it has a good sized trunk. Bluetooth has performed very well with very few issues (occasionally it thinks I am on a phone call and won't allow any stereo functions until you turn the car off but this is rare)",3

This car has an inaccurate and horrible navigation and entertainment system. The phone based system works via Bluetooth AND a connected USB connector. If the phone is connected navigation with maps is available, BUT not any entertainment apps.  To hear these apps the phone must be disconnected. That is connected = navigation, not connected = music etc.. Driving and using maps and listening to music the driver must continually connect and disconnect the USB connector. This certainly is distracted driving and should be avoided leading to a choice, navigation or music.  This broken system applies to any user with an IPhone with IOS 11.2.1 or later. Toyota has completely ignored this problem and is unable or unwilling to fix. .",1

I've gotten good fuel mileage (within their stated range for this car).  The interior is great.

Scout is positively horrible. The audio instructions don't sync with the graphic maps, it's constantly restarting,  it will not accept voice commands accurately, and it averages about 1 out of 10 in finding an address or location. Recently, I was sitting in my dealerships parking lot and Scout couldn't find the dealership. I have addressed this with my dealership three times and  with Toyotas Help Line once. On all occasions, I have literally been told: 1) That they are aware that the system has problems and that they get a lot of complaints about it - one service Mgr went so far to say that he stopped using it in his car, because it was so unreliable and just uses Google maps from his phone and 2) Toyotas Help Line told me that they were aware of the problem and we're working on a fix, but did not have a software update scheduled.  So at the end of the day, I have a GPS system in my car that doesn't work and Toyota knew that it didn't work when they sold me the car. Toyota should be ashamed of this kind of behavior.

1096, on 07/08/17 11:12 AM (PDT),DL Hatton ,2017 Toyota Camry  LE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Honest review.," I really like the car. It's the best car I could find for the money I paid and I've always wanted a Camry since  they started making them 20 miles away from me. I got it when they were clearing out the 2017 models to make room for the new ones, so I got a great price.  The only complaint I have is a little bit of wind noise around the drivers side window. Even though the LE is the base model, it has plenty of features to it and I didn't need or want most of the things found in the higher priced models. So I am very satisfied with the car and I'm glad I bought it.  It's not the most exciting car but at my age I don't need speed. And I didn't want a sports car, or a car that rode like one. I wanted a good, smooth riding, reliable car that will serve me well for a long time. It does everything well you expect from a car. After owning the car for a year I have some updated thoughts on the Camry. I think they just don't make  them the way they used to. Even though I like the car, it sure isn't perfect. I have wind noise coming from the drivers window and door. The dealership stated that  they would have to get a Toyota engineer to test drive it to determine if it's excessive. That's basically a way of saying they don't want to bother with it. It is excessive and it's rather bothersome, especially at interstate speeds. The dealership stated they hadn't had complaints about wind noise on this model vehicle but I have read reviews and many owners stated they had wind noise too.  Another thing I don't like is I can hear every little imperfection in the road. That doesn't mean I feel it but I do hear it, that's annoying too.    There is a distinct noise coming from underneath the car somewhere when I hit certain bumps. It just gives me a feeling that the car wasn't built and put together well. That is a feeling I don't like. With no other car have I heard wind noise and sounds when I hit bumps, not like this. I have even had thoughts  it had been wrecked badly and put back together. I don't have other complaints about the 2017 Camry LE, but I think this is enough. I set out to buy what hopefully was gonna be the last car I buy. But now I'm thinking when I pay it off I should sell it and buy another car, probably not a Toyota. I wasn't expecting perfection but I was expecting what I've always heard about a Camry. This car doesn't inspire confidence and even though I don't feel it's just going to fall apart while driving it, it gives me an uneasy feeling at times.  Maybe I'll have another update some day.",3

I will never understand those who say the Camry has a ho hum look when it's obvious most of the other car makers copy the Camry style.  The 4 cylinder engine is quiet and responsive.    My only complaints are the SE ride is a lot firmer than the LE and too many Camry's only come with a base entertainment system.  I had to really search for one with HD and satellite radio with connected navigation.  All controls are laid out well and are easy to use.  If you've had a Camry before you'll feel right at home.  The extra information on the info screen between the tach and speedometer is very handy.Now it's a year later and I must say that I still love the look of the car but after driving the Ford Fusion and Nissan Altima I can see that they provide a little more driving excitement with quick handling and acceleration, not that the Camry is slow at either of these tasks, it just doesn't seem quite as quick.  I'll gladly take that trade off given the Camry's much better repair record.  I'm going though a bit of Camry withdrawal the last couple of weeks in an attempt to keep my new car looking new.  It's in the body shop the wife side swiped it coming out of the driveway causing some minor damage and I compounded the issue when I hit a plastic outdoor chair that was in the middle of the interstate.  Both minor, but as I said I'm trying to keep my new car looking new.  I find myself wishing for real bumpers on cars that could prevent costly damage in minor bumps. I'm old enough to remember being able to push a car with another car.  Something only a fool would attempt today.  Overall cars keep getting better and better. My feeling is the Camry is one of the models leading the way.One thing I have noticed is the way controls operate varies greatly from car to car.  They all have their own way of doing things so keep that in mind when you go to buy and find the operating style that best suits what you like and expect.  I'm accustomed to Toyotas having owned Camrys since 2004.  The others are good, just different.  But it can be a little unsettling when you get used to things being a certain way.",5

The gas mileage is approximately half of what I got in the Prius, but I knew that when I bought it. The safety features are very good. The moon roof will probably never be used but you can't get the car without it. I really miss the rear window windshield wiper. I don't see why the headlights don't automatically come on with the windshield wipers. All in all I'm very satisfied.",5

It seems that may have bee true years ago but not anymore.  I have had problems with the temperature control where you have to set it to 77F in order to get the temperature to be in the low 70s in the car.  If you set it at 72F, the temperature ends up in the mid- to upper 60s in the car.  I also have a vibration that has developed and, in researching the problem, I found that this is a common problem on the 2015 - 2017 Toyota Camry, all trims.  I have been fighting with Toyota about this and they said that the car is fine.  I read other people tales of dealing with Toyota on the same issue and they received the same response.  They have tried replacing the tires, rebalancing, etc. and nothing fixes the problem.  Toyota is refusing to deal with the problem.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from the Camry unless you like driving a car that vibrates all of the time.",2

1102, on 04/28/17 12:02 PM (PDT),Mike W. ,2017 Toyota Camry  LE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),THANKS FOR NOTHING!," Bought the car in January, then found out the air conditioner did not work in April.  Took it in for its 10,000 mile service and the dealer (Brian Bemis in Dekalb, IL) changed the oil and rotated the tires.  When I booked the appointment I told them I needed the AC to be diagnosed.  I didn't think they would have time to fix it but I wanted to know what was wrong with it.  They made me wait 90 minutes then told me that I would have to bring it back because they didn't have time to check the AC.  90 minutes to change the oil and rotate the tires?!  No working AC on a brand new car?!  Poor dealer support, and a lemon for a brand new car.  Just stay away.  I am also seeing the low tire pressure light every 2 weeks because they put Firestone tires on the car.  These are the worst brand name tires you can get.  I hate seeing the warning light on a car with about 10,000 miles on it.  It has been a terrible ownership experience.  I will never buy another Toyota.  Update after 15 months of ownership:  Yes I still own this car because I refuse to eat the huge depreciation hit.  Resale value on these looks awful.  The rocker panels are cheap plastic and both of mine are broken.  The estimate to fix them was $2,400+.  Gas mileage is still the only good thing about this car.  I have put 46,000 miles on it.  Dealer says I need new tires.  Went in for an oil change then an hour later they told me they just rotated the tires.  Booked the oil change online at St. Charles Toyota.  Not sure how they screwed that up but not going back there for service.",2

I have the mystic grey color and it is like an old mood ring. When the light shines on it the green and blues sparkle. It looks black, then blue, then dark green. Anyway I have all the safety features you can ask for and several other things are a must like the sunroof. I felt like if I were going to be driving a 4 door I want sporty yet luxury. The color of the inside of the material is called ash. It is a light grey with a dark grey. Very sweet car. Only thing I do not like is the backup camera. When the sun is shinning down you can not see backing up. The technology needs to be better. I like the way the lines on the camera go with you when you are backing up. This does not have that feature. The lines are only straight they do not move back and forth nor does it beep when you are backing up. I did get the feature with the lane switching technology and this is to be on the back as well if a cart or kid comes behind me it should beep. I do not see that being an option. I have had the car for 3 days so far and was disappointed that it did not have that feature.",5

Took it to dealer, chief technician insisted on ""turning the rotor"" since it showed signs of warpage due to heat. I insisted on replacement, along with new pads and brake control module which probably caused this problem. After demanding to speak to service manager, they decided to do as I asked and replaced all 4 rotos and pads on all 4 corners but, not the module. Now, Monday following repair, drove 30 yards to end of street, all the previous brake warning lights returned! So, off to dealership we go in the morning to see ehat else it the problem...can't be the brand new rotors or pads, only thing left is the brake control module that I insisted they replace in the first place. I was a Cadillac technician at dealership, I know how they work.UPDATE, APR, 2018.Traded the car in for poor support. Bought a brand new 2017 not long after the first review.Pretty much the same car with issues getting in & out of the driver's side.I AM Japanese, 5'-10"" and I can not see any way for me to get in & out without hitting my knee on the steering wheel or hitting my head on roof line.Head lights are a joke. After having HID in my 2016 Tundra, these lights are dingy yellow and visibility poor on a clear night. At the LEAST Toyota could do us to upgrade new vehicles to minimum LED lights.",4
1107, on 03/28/17 10:33 AM (PDT),awolfs ,2017 Toyota Camry  XSE 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),From Point A to Point B," Edmunds gave me a good number to expect to pay.  I actually paid a little less.  My old Camry was 21 years old.  This one is nicer and better in just about every way.  I don't need to tear up the highways.  I just want to go safely from Point A to Point B.  My chief requirement of a car is that when I turn the key, it starts; when I push the gas pedal, it goes; when I push the brake, it stops; and it feels solid to drive.  Not having excessive maintenance is a plus, but I don't know how this car will be.  The old one was great.  I like how this car feels when I drive it.  I haven't figured out all the bells and whistles yet, but those I have, I like.",5
1108, on 03/13/17 07:08 AM (PDT),Wayne Albrecht ,2017 Toyota Camry  LE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Our First Camry," The 2017 Camry SE was our first Camry and our 4th Toyota overall. We bought the car on 3/11/17 but had been shopping around for awhile. We had looked at Honda, Kia and Hyundai. While the others came close (The Accord being just a little less expensive), our loyalty with Toyota and the local dealership was the determining factor. Pros: Handles great, smooth and relatively quiet ride, nice body look (A Classy/Sporty mix), interior is intuitive and smart, very comfortable, easy visuals from all angles while driving, price is reasonable for it's class and features. Cons: Only one, really; gas mileage. Overall, the 2017 Camry is a solid car and, if like our last few Toyotas, will be in the family for a long time.***Update 3/13/18***We have now had the car for one year. My wife mostly drives this car (I drive it a little on weekends) and, after one year of driving it, still loves it as much as she did when we bought it. A year in, the car still drives smooth and quiet for it's class. It still handles great and there are no complaints from us. Like I said in my initial review, we are Toyota loyalists...lol. This car is probably the best car we have owned one year in a purchase. We keep our vehicles a long time, so it will interesting to see how this car holds up compared to other Toyotas we have owned.",4

Controls are easy to use - not into all the Tech stuff.  4 cylinder engine is perfect choice for average commuter.  Gas mileage is OK - could be better.  Like the 6 speed automatic over the CVT in other cars.  Love the interior layout and seat comfort.  Test drove the others and the Camry was the best value.  Overall a great family sedan.  Good deals now to make room for the redesigned 2018.  Dealership was great - easy to work with and no pressure.Update at 30,000 miles: Reliability has been excellent.  The OEM Bridgestone tires are terrible - too much road noise and wearing quickly.  Can't wait to replace with quieter tires.  The only complaint I have is the drivers seat is fairly hard and uncomfortable on a long trip.  No matter how much I adjust the seat I cannot get comfortable.

1111, on 02/22/17 21:48 PM (PST),Neward Thelman ,2017 Toyota Camry  SE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Some Flaws But Typical Of Today's Cars," 1-1/2 years after purchase, I can say that the 2016-2017 Camry's about par for the course for cars in its class. All of the annoyances found in present day designs are present in the Camry. Among them are: poor rear visibility and colossal blind spots due to enormous headrests and steep windows; cheaper materials [the rear seat is 2/3's vinyl, even though it's supposed to be cloth]; slippery, unstable-feeling electronic steering, etc.Starting with the engine, Toyota uses what its salespeople refer to as ""chain drive"", which means that Corollas and Camrys use a a timing chain rather than a belt [which can break, causing catastrophic damage to the engine]. That's good. It's more reliable. Unfortunately, it also makes the engine noisy. Diesel engine noisy. Of course, the manufacturer can reduce that noise to inaudibility, but that costs extra money. I found that the Corolla engine noise was really loud inside the cabin. The Camry was less noisy, but there's more to the story. I tested four different Camrys. Three of them were tolerably quiet. The one that I ordered from the factory has turned out to be loud. Clattering, dieseling loud. Even worse, in cold weather, it takes a long time for the car to warm up. The colder the temperature, the longer it takes for warm up. How long? Five to ten minutes. Yep. That's sitting, burning gas, not moving for ten minutes - like some 1952 Rambler. Of course, I took the car to Toyota service. They explained that the long warm up is due to the use of a timing chain. They said it takes that long for the oil to warm up enough to allow the cam shaft and the timing chain to reach operating temperature. And, yes, the noise levels were ""normal"". In fact, they found all problems to be ""withing normal operating standards and parameters"". The lessons here are that [1] there seems to be considerable Camry car-to-car variability, and [2] whether a manufacturer gives you a one day or a lifetime warranty, they can get out of fixing a problem by simply claiming that an issue's ""within normal operating standards..."".Heading into the cabin, you'll find that the seats are cheap, hard, and uncomfortable. Don't plan on any long trips. I ordered cloth seats. The 'cloth' is actually slippery polyester, with extended sections of plain vinyl. As a result, if you use seat covers, they'll slip and slide so much that they verge on making driving unsafe. Even worse, Toyota seems to have the largest and widest head rests in the industry. I've compared. Toyota's head rests seem to be made for Godzilla. They far wider than those used by Honda, Mazda, Hyundai - pretty much everyone. Forget about being able to see anything over your left shoulder. You can't. But, at least when you crash - which, sooner or later, you will - that massive head rest will give you 10% more whiplash protection than a 1976 Bonneville would.The heat duct for your feet isn't oriented low enough, so that even with the heat blowing full on, your feet will still be cold on really cold days. The stock radio and sound system are execrable. And I mean that. Not just bad. Really, really bad. Almost unlistenable. If you buy a Camry, pop for an audio system upgrade.       The ignition switch on the steering column is poorly machined and of low quality. It was like that in all four Camry models I tired. You'll be poking the key clumsily every single time you want to start your car. The leather covering the steering wheel is thin and of low quality, but the same as I found in all of the competition. Also, only the top third of the steering wheel is actual leather. The rest is 'pleather', although is seems to be of high quality.  The Camry's electronic power steering has as much unit-to-unit variation as its timing chain characteristics. Three of the Camrys I test drove had reasonably weighted steering. Of course, the car that I got has crazy slippery steering. Driving it always feels as though you're hydroplaning on a sheet of sheer ice.  The worse feeling is the one you get driving at highway speeds. Unstable and veering out of control.So, with all of these factors, plus whichever new problems might be lurking, waiting to appear and make my ownership of this lump of sheet metal even more miserable, I'd say that I fully regret ever buying a Camry. Unfortunately, none of the competition's all that much different or better. At least the Camry's got a real transmission; some of its competition offers only CVT's.If you're thinking of getting one, make sure you really look it over before you part with your hard-earned money. If you do decide to get one, you may be better off with one from the dealer's stock, since you can test it out before hand. It seems you never know what you'll get ordering from the factory.",3

On November 18, 2016, we bought a new 2017 Toyota Camry. We bought Toyota because of its reputation in reliability and quality.  But it turns out this car is defective and made with a bad transmission. Because of this major defect, we have reason to believe there’s extremely poor quality control of the production process of this entire car if not other 2017 Camry’s. We weren’t given a chance to test drive the new car by our dealer. On our way back home on 11/18, we noticed that the car jerked forward abnormally every time when we pressed on the brake.  We took our car back to the dealer on 11/22 after try driving it multiple times at dealer’s recommendation. It took the dealer 4 hours to fix it. They adjusted the fluid level within the transmission according to the paperwork.  We haven’t had a chance driving the car again until 12/5 because of a flu in the family. On 12/5, the car won’t reverse and showed a warning message “Check Vehicle Stability Control System”. On 12/6/16, Toyota sent a toll truck and took our car back to the dealer’s service department. This time the service department replaced the defective new transmission with a re-manufactured (non-new) transmission.  In two weeks after we had this car, the car has gone through 2 repairs on transmission and included the replacement of transmission on a brand new car. We paid for a brand new Toyota Camry XLE, now 2 weeks later, the transmission is broken and replaced with a refurbished transmission. It might be a better choice to just buy a used car with much less price. This is a terrible new car experience for us and we have to warn other consumers about it. There should be something special about owning a new car. Toyota destroyed our experience by giving us a defective car and wants us to go through a lengthy process to get a refund or replacement. Stay away from 2017 Toyota Camry!!",1

Do to our plans to purchase a house I'm 20 months I tried keep costs contained so as much as I wanted another 300c I wanted to keep on budget.  The Camry SE is exceptionally quiet and smooth riding. The 2.5 4 cylinder provides decent acceleration. It's no Rucker but it's more than adequate. Interior materials could be better in my opinion and there should be ambient lighting in cup holder, foot weeks, door handles, and map pockets. Rear door panels should have soft touch surfaces too. Seats are far and away much improved over my grand parents 2011. I looked at a ton of cars and rented them and spent a few days with each. The Camry much to my surprise I even thigh it was the best at one particular thing except ride and sound isolation perhaps did everything well.

Things I like better: back cemera, modern body shape, touch screen,  roomy glove compartment with a lock, USB plug. Things I don't like: insulation is not good, wind sound louder; body construction feels not as solid as 2005 model, big gaps at all outside metal pieces; the car still moves a little without parking brake on when you switch to park (giving you scary feelings).

First of all it is reasonably priced and of course reliability is expected to be great.  One of things many don't realize is that this car has more American made parts, assembled in America and is more American combined, than any other car on the road right now.  Leaving that aside I will say that the driving of this car is quite wonderful.  I have the SE which has a bit tighter suspension, which makes the ride a little more firm.  The 4 cylinder engine has plenty of power and combined with the six speed transmission makes driving a joy!  The Entune entertainment system works and sounds great.  Another great feature is the center screen on the dash that can give you (customizable) digital speedo, miles left to drive, tire pressure, odometer and other things that you can set.  The ruby red pearl with 17"" wheels looks awesome and so far like I said in the description, this is the best car I have ever owned!",5

While not as engaging to drive as the fusion with the 2.0 eco boost the price (31K vs 38K MSRP similarly equipped) more than compensates for the difference in a segment where most of us need the car to commute to work and for family road trips. The Camry isn't the most engaging to drive or the best looking but for the money and the expected reliability I decided to trade in my 2012 Passat for the Camry. The pros that I see : price, reliability, navigation easy to use and more functional than the accord or Altima. The cons: styling, driving dynamics.",5

1132, on 10/04/16 16:09 PM (PDT),D MacDonald ,2017 Toyota Camry  XLE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Switched from Honda to Toyota," 1. Toyota has slightly higher reliability  2.  Better sound system.  3. Honda has ugly cheap tiny sounding speakers mounted at left/right front corners of windshield.  4. Toyota better price.  5.Toyota dealers much easier to deal with.  6. Been with Honda for 28 years, time to try the ""other guys"".10/09/2017Now that I've had it for a year....I wish I had looked at other cars.  Maybe I should have stayed with the Honda.  The number one problem is the front seating comfort.  It is just not there.  My wife does not like the passenger seat...can't adjust it to a comfortable position.  She has lots of trouble with getting a comfortable fit in most cars she sits in and even the drivers side is not all that great.  We both now think that owning this Toyota may be short lived.  In a year or two I think we will be out looking for a better, more comfortable car.  Also I thought the gas mileage in town would be much better than my previous 2004 Honda but it is not.  Pretty much avg 27mpg in town; 35 on the highway.  I think Toyota, Honda and other makers are purposefully keeping the mileage low in hopes you will head for those hybrids, and we are not ready to head for those cars.04/10/2018Still feel the same about this car.  The mpg is lower than it should be - not happy about it.  Still wish I had found the right Honda - or should have gone with the Subaru Legacy that we test drove.  Recently had trouble with the car not starting - road servcie came and jumped the car and it started - next day would not start - road service once again jumped the car and suggested driving it somewhere for an hour to charge the battery.  Did that.  Got back, turned off the engine, tried to start it again, no go.  Called Toyota to come get the car.  Road service comes - jump-starts the car.  Drive car to Toyota service - park - do the paper work - come back to car and ---- yes -- it started.  Toyota found out that one cell in the new battery was dead - battery would not hold charge.  Toyota puts in a cheap battery with only a 2yr warranty - what happened to those 60 month warranty batteries?  Will be taking car from West coast to East coast soon and will see what kind of true mpg we get.  Maybe getting out of a state with watered down gas will help the mileage.",3

The sensing package is great for long distance driving adaptive cruise control lane keep assist. I can literally use my knees rested on steering wheel to drive the car on highway. Interior is nice. Now the flaws. Sensing has issues in heavy rain or snow. The headlights could be brighter. The wheel wells vs size of wheels. Seems that the wheels could of been a bit bigger. Handles like a dream though, touchy brakes make you feel safe. Trunk has adequate space with fold down seats. It's clean will turn heads. And get you compliments. Gas mileage varies on how you drive coming home from WV i achieved 41 plus on highway using cruise control. 2.0 liter has ample power and gas gage will drop when laying into gas. No e brake only a little electronic switch. Lots of add on a for interior available. If you tint the rear window it will become almost impossible to reverse without the back up camera at night.

Even with lack of lumbar adjustment the seat is comfortable for long day of driving. The car is peppy and the handling is actually fun. The trunk is good sized and doing doing chores and grocery shopping etc are made easier with nice lift over height. My mileage on trips is well over 40 usually around 43.6mpg. My around town mileage is around 30-36mpg. I do not beat the car but I do drive 70+ on the Thurways. It drives and feels like the day I picked it up new. I would highly recommend.

Called the dealer who sold me the car and he could care less about me or my issue and simply said ""lets play devils advocate if u complain Honda could simply say its how u drive the car and what u use it for that caused these AC components to fall from underneath the dashboard"" keep in mind I paid $3048 for a warranty so he says take it to Honda repair....I do they fix it and im on my way. A month later the rear interior carpet starts to come loose from the frame (YouTube this issue other 2016/17 civic owners have the same problem) fast foward 13 months 50,000 miles later the AC stops working. I live in NYC where its only hot for 11 weeks a year so this AC only lasted 1 summer before it crapped out. Again I go to the dealer and in the midst of a week long 100 degree heat wave I have no AC....it takes the dealer 3 WEEKS to finally get the clutch and coil the 2 parts that due to mechanical failure stopped the AC from working. The Honda parts and repair manager of this particular facility simply said BLAME HONDA its not us is HONDA. My first brand new Honda experience was ruined and I will NEVER purchase another car new or used from any Honda dealer again. The only thing impressive about the 2017 Civic is its mpg, other than that your in for a headache with this car.",3

The car’s sensors are constantly sensoring other things on the road rather than other vehicles and when it actually does sense cars the vehicle completely stops. The randomly stops when I am driving. I have taken the car in to get check by the dealership I bought it from on several occasions, but it supposedly passes the computer. I gone to other dealerships to trade it in for another vehicle, but everyone says that the car is not worth the price and they cannot help me. Be smart and stay away from this vehicle.

As you would expect I'm not a happy to see my NEW vehicle with 4,000 miles on it with an engine oil leak. The only way to make a proper repair would be to pull the motor and reseal the pan. I'll be visiting the dealership soon to see what they have to say. I'm sure I won't be pleased with their recommendations.

1153, on 01/22/18 13:30 PM (PST),Michael ,2017 Honda Civic  Touring 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Disappointed," So a few months ago I picked up a 2017 Civic Touring sedan as I needed a vehicle to commute approximately ~50 miles each way a day to work. I ended up getting a great deal on the car, but after driving with the car I'm starting to wonder if there was a reason for it.First, I discovered that there is a well-documented Touring subwoofer rattle that developed immediately on my drive home from the dealership (the songs from my Pandora station apparently featured more of a bass than the songs I listened to on the radio during the test drive). Took it to the dealer a few times and the techs there alternated between ""We can't hear anything"" to ""You just can't listen to that type of music"" to ""That sounds is normal, that song will sound like that in any Touring model"". I ended up following a guide to make a wedge covered in electrical tape, which stifled the rattle for most songs. However, even with that the other day a song came on and the smacking/rattle was so loud I thought the rear glass was going to shatter!The first weekend with my car I went to wax/wash it and found a flaw in the factory paint (dirt nib) on the right quarter panel next to the tail light. Took it to the dealer and after about a month of back-and-forth they decided to fix the paint under warranty. Great, I thought.Not so much. The shop they took the car to for the fix was careless during the sanding process and shaved the paint on the edge of the nearby door down to the metal. I found it about a week after picking up the car when I hand-washed it and the paint just flaked off. The shop is denying all responsibility and even had the gall to suggest I somehow managed to open the door so hard and fast that I had somehow managed to shred the paint all the way to the metal. Waiting to hear back from the general manager, but I have a feeling they will dig their heels in on this case. The Honda manager who approved the ""repair"" hasn't responded to my emails about it, either.While I have been able to mostly hide the damage with touch up paint (and I'm considering buying aftermarket door edge guards to prevent other damage and hide it completely) I'm still furious.Then I have a list of other minor annoyances with the car:1) Auto-dimming mirror sucks. Doesn't seem to work when there's a car 5-30 feet behind me, which is of course when I expect it to work. 2) Adaptive Cruise Control: always tracks 1 mph off what it's supposed to do. If I set the cruise at 70, the car will go 69. I know it's a small quirk but I find it terribly annoying.3) Rain sensing wipers: apparently this is another issue other owners have experienced. It fails completely at identifying the proper speed to go and was always either too slow or too fast.4) Disappointed in overall craftsmanship of the vehicle. When popping the trunk the area directly around the edge of the trunk isn't fully painted and even has areas where paint pooled and dripped. The welding for the doors is low quality and you can see bulges and drips where the metal cooled and was not smoothed out prior to being painted.6) City MPG is nowhere near 30. Try more like 22-25.All-in-all, very disappointed with this purchase. I'm hoping some of the new or refreshed Toyotas and Mazdas for the 2019 model year will include Apple Carplay because I honestly am considering taking the trade-in loss and dumping this car. I like the way it handles, the peppy engine and the fact that I consistently can get 38 on my highway commutes but this whole experience has soured me to the car, and the whole Honda brand.",1

1156, on 01/08/18 07:53 AM (PST),Captain Flounder ,2017 Honda Civic  Si 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo 6M),A surprisingly sporty sedan," My primary vehicle is a 2016 Mazda Miata.  It's a great 3rd car but a horrible 2nd car.  I needed a fun to drive vehicle that could hold a car seat and not break the wallet.  I looked at the GTI (loved it), Acura TLX, Audi A3/4/5 sportback, and BMW 4 series Gran Coupe before finally driving a 2018 Honda Civic Si.  I would be in a GTI right now but couldn't negotiate an acceptable deal.  That turned out to be fortuitous because I am now driving a 2017 Honda Civic Si and loving it.  It is a truly remarkable vehicle for the price.  First, the awesome stuff.  As the owner of a Miata, I really like the handling of the Civic.  It is a firm but not punishing ride.  The steering is remarkably accurate and communicative.  Impressive.  I only have about 200 miles on the car and can already tell the tires are the weak link in the ride/suspension/handling realm.  Seats are excellent, firm and supportive without being confining.  The power is adequate, quick enough to be fun but not fast enough to hurt yourself.  Fuel mileage is remarkable!  70+ mph = 40 mpg.  I was not expecting that at all.  The vehicle is also remarkably roomy.  Lastly for the positives is Honda's lane watch.  A small camera on the passenger side mirror that activates with the turn signal.  You now can see on the ride side in high clarity what is going on next to you.  I love it!  I wish all my vehicles had this feature.  Now for the less positive things.  The clutch is horrible.  WAY too light.  When you add the engine's propensity to hang onto RPM under load it makes for a less than stellar shifting experience.  Hopefully I will get used to it.  The audio system is more than adequate but there are NO knobs for volume.  Nor are their knobs or buttons for turning on the a/c or fan.  Argh!  Honda got so many things right with this vehicle it is maddening that these small details were not addressed.  Overall though, I am impressed with the vehicle.  You will be hard pressed to find something else at the same price point.  That makes dealing with some of the less positive aspects totally doable.  Well done Honda.  I look forward to many trouble free miles driving this fun little sedan.",4

Dual zone climate control is wonderful. Touch screen for adjusting vents and fan speed is a catastrophe. Terrible idea made worse by abysmal execution.

1159, on 12/30/17 05:41 AM (PST),Alice ,2017 Honda Civic  EX 4dr Hatchback (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Can't Get Much Better For $20k," I have now been leasing this vehicle for a year and it has been a wonderful car. The only downside to the vehicle is I have the larger head-unit in mine and sometimes it can fight my Apple CarPlay. When it works - which is about 95% of the time - it is AMAZING. When it doesn't work, I spend a solid 5-10 minutes restarting my car and rebooting the system over and over to get it to work properly. Other than that the only other downside to her is the interior feels very cheap and plastic. The seats are not the most comfortable either. BUT with the technology offered - Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, SeriusXM, color digital gauge display, remote start, heated seats, auto lights - it is easy to overlook the poor quality and the sometimes difficult radio. Overall, for the price and cost of maintenance (a whopping $70 oil change with tires rotated) it is an excellent daily driver that is easy to fall in love with.",4

I bought it for the safety options and the 5 star safety rating. Second reason is the fuel mileage. I didn't want her asking everyday for gas money. It can get over 37mpg in the city if driven correctly. Teaching her to take her time ....well that's another obstacle. Third reason is the manufacturer. I pride my self on not ever buying a foreign car. I drive a Ford f350 diesel. I respect our country and countrymen. To go and buy a Honda was tough. But after looking at where this car was manufactured  and assembled I changed my mind. I have neighbors who actually had their  hands on this car before it was givin a birth certificate....lol.

1161, on 12/26/17 21:46 PM (PST),Tom ,2017 Honda Civic  Touring 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Great little car," By far, it’s the best looking civic to date. I should say it’s the best looking compact sedan. Period. The looks attracted me first. Then I looked up the performance. Pretty impressive for a small car. Turbo charged with a lot of torque for its class. It utilizes a CVT transmission because the Japanese engineers found the performance of the new turbo charged motor of the civic was best optimized when mated with the CVT. I’ve driven way faster cars before but for the civic, it’s pretty good. After determining the performance was above par, I looked at the trim options and features. I have a saying: “your car is like your second home. You want to be comfortable in it and get the best money can buy for that model.” So I bought the touring model sedan. It came with full LED headlights and high beams which was a selling point for me. I like LED. Nice sporty rims and Honda sensing package was standard. The audio system was banging! The subwoofer is a nice touch to the 10 speaker system found in the touring trim. Spacious trunk and a very, very clean interior. Most of the center stack and dash controls are integrated into the 7” infotainment screen. It gives you a more spacious, less clustered feel when you sit inside. Not too shabby for a small car. People complain about the volume control and how there’s no knob. The steering column volume control allows you to push up and down to lower and raise volume accordingly. You don’t have to swipe if you don’t want to. But swipe touch is an option too. Your preference. I like pushing it to control volume because swiping adjusts the volume a little too much and harder to control unless you want an extreme high or extreme low volume. It has a smartphone connection, USB port, and a 12V charging port. It has layered center console up front so you can hide stuff behind the shifter. Nice touch. The main center console is deep and huge. You’ll have to see it for yourself. With all the nice features this car has, there’s no need to test drive it because I’ve done enough research to know what I’m getting myself into. To this day and almost 1,000 miles later, I have no buyer’s remorse. No regrets of any kind. I did take my car in to the dealer for a couple things. Rear lights stopped working and when the fan is turned up high, you can hear a rattling sound. Car’s new so warranty kicked in for all the repairs. Don’t you love new cars? Otherwise, motor and tranny is in excellent shape. CVT transmission is very responsive and gives it a mean low end torque you need to get going. Turbo does the rest. Oh, one more thing. There’s no gas cap. Yeah that’s right. Honda decided to get rid of it for a new design. You just shove the pump into the opening and fill. There’s a rubber nipple like opening that acts like a cap. Kinda nice not having to fiddle with the cap when filling it up. There’s no lever to pop the gas lid open. It activated with your key fob. Sensor. If you’re next to it getting ready to pump gas, the lid will open by a single push. So it’s secure. Just like a car door. Sensors. There’s a whole lot of customizing that I won’t get into or this review will be too long. On the 7” screen, go into vehicle settings and you can customize a bunch of stuff. For example, you can have the car auto lock when you walk away from the civic. Pretty cool right?",4

1167, on 12/09/17 15:28 PM (PST),ksm1998 ,2017 Honda Civic  Si 2dr Coupe (1.5L 4cyl Turbo 6M),My new Si," I have owned many cars and was not really in the market for a new car, but Honda was having a lease special (only $199!!!) for a 2017 Civic Si and I couldn't resist.  Let's just say I am very happy. I got it in Lunar Silver and I actually think it is a really good looking coupe.  The rear wing does interfere with rear vision a bit, but certainly not a deal breaker.  The car is a joy to drive, with great damping to soak up bumps and not be too harsh considering it is a sports car.  It is quick enough to be fun, but not so quick that you're breaking the law in just 2nd gear.  There is the expected turbo lag (and/or boost threshold) issue, but keep it under 3000rpm and you will get nearly 40mpg out of this 1.5 liter.  As with most Honda manuals, this is a joy to shift.  It is not quite Miata slick or nearly as precise as the S2000s I have owned, but still fun.  It is not like the long, rubbery throws of VWs, BMWs and Audis I have owned. I am 6'1"" and my head nearly hits the roof.  Tons of leg room, but if you are taller than me, your head may poke through the sunroof (or get the sedan which had a bit more headroom).  Seats are not leather, but are heated and I prefer that (GTI is the same).  Leather is too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer.  Stereo system sounds good and infotainment system works well.  Who needs navigation when you have Android Auto?  I thought I wouldn't like the lack of a volume knob, but the steering wheel volume button works quickly to turn volume up or down.  This car will not be my daily driver (especially because it is a lease), but I will be missing it on the days I am not behind it's wheel.",5

1169, on 11/29/17 13:14 PM (PST),Jennifer Halleman ,2017 Honda Civic  LX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),2017 has been a great year!," I am female, prefer manual transmission, and have 2 kids who are becoming teenagers.  Moved from a 2011 Ford Fiesta hatchback into a 2017 Honda Civic Sedan.  The Fiesta was rapidly becoming too small (backseat and interior) for 2 adults and 2 teenagers.  I appreciated that Honda accepted my trade (as several other dealerships would not), they worked with my large amount of negative equity (almost $10k), and I was able to purchase my first brand new car, with a fair/affordable payment due to their diligence in securing a 1.9% interest rate.  The safety features on this Civic made my insurance rates very affordable--my monthly premium only increased by $1.50, which was a pleasant surprise.  Things I like with this car---the backseat and interior is large and roomy enough for my teenagers.  The car has ample power, shifts smoothly, ride is smooth and it handles well.  The suspension and steering is good, brakes respond well, and the interior is quiet.    The exterior is sporty but elegant at the same time.  Gas mileage on a manual really depends on how you drive it, in my opinion.  With my Fiesta, I got great gas mileage, which is the primary reason we bought it 4 years ago----but the drawback on it (besides size) was not much power once you hit 3rd gear.  The Civic is a 6 speed manual, and I'm having to re-learn how to drive a manual now.  The shifting needs to be quicker than I'm used to.  I don't have much use for 6th gear, as most of my driving is stop and go and not on the highway.  My LX is base model, there are no bells and whistles.  Power windows and door locks are standard, it has Bluetooth for music and phone.  The backup camera has been nice and has a wide range of vision.  The radio and speakers are not good at all, but I can and will pay aftermarket to upgrade at some point.  I miss the heated seats my Fiesta had.  I wish the vanity mirrors were lighted.  I wish it had a different key-fob, as it has a trunk release that is VERY sensitive, and almost every time I get out of the car holding the keys, the trunk pops open---that is a major annoyance.  The major complaints I have after owning and driving it for a month are the speakers and the trunk release on the key-fob.",4

1171, on 11/19/17 11:58 AM (PST),Alec ,2017 Honda Civic  Type R 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M),2017 Honda Civic Type R  -  The Last Samurai?," Perhaps the most fitting descriptor I could open with for the 2017 Honda Civic Type R is the millennial expression “extra”. The top Urban Dictionary definition for ""extra"" is “over the top, excessive, dramatic behavior, way too much”. The latest Type R’s looks are all of the above, but that is mostly where the new “extra” ends and the traditional, positive denotation begins. If you can look past or appreciate the peacocking aesthetics, the Civic Type R is an extra-special anachronism. On paper, this car looks like it came from a bygone era. But like many of it's hot Hondas ancestors, the Civic Type R's published 0-60 and 1/4 mile performance is deceiving and undersells an extremely fun to drive machine.While the segment’s other hottest hatchbacks come with all-wheel drive, Honda continues to redefine the limits of front-wheel propulsion. Early dyno tests reveal that the 2.0L turbo K20C1 engine was likely underrated at 306 hp, with readings as high as 295 wheel horsepower. Merging onto highways is an oddly similar experience to my stock C5 Corvette. Yes, the Chevrolet was roughly a full second faster in every rolling acceleration measure, and the Type R does have a hint of turbo lag, but the ""R"" also remains unflappably precise and planted as speeds rapidly approach reckless driving territory. Thanks to the brilliant dual-axis suspension and Continental tires, I have yet to notice more than the faintest wiggle of torque steer during flat-out corner exits in second gear. Offered only with a superb six-speed manual transmission and no optional equipment, the Type R is leaner than its cohorts, handling more like a ‘roided-up CRX than it’s 3117-pound curb weight would suggest. Selecting “+R” mode sets the shocks to their firmest damping and sharpens throttle sensitivity. Couple this mode with a fully-deactivated  VSA system and the rear end will dance and oversteer out of lower to mid-speed turns. In high-speed cornering and braking abilities, I don't believe any new, unmodified car can hang with the Civic Type R below the $40,000 mark. However, this Porsche-like poise can be softened in “Sport” mode and brought back to Civic Touring levels in “Comfort” mode. Both the engine and exhaust notes are also highly subdued, no annoying drones on the highway. Admittedly, I am this car’s demographic bullseye buyer (32 year-old, middle class male) who got his driver's license in 2001, the year many of us first met Brian O’Conner and Dom Toretto. But putting my fanboy biases aside, the Civic Type R is a masterpiece. It is likely one of the last highly tactile, reasonably affordable “driver’s cars” Honda will produce thanks to market trends and harsher mandatory regulations every year. Thank you, Honda, for your latest -- and hopefully not last -- Samurai.",5

My parents had an accord back in the early 80s, and it was fine--just boring.  My more recent interactions with hondas carried on that assessment.  Then, I saw a 2017 civic, and I really was surprised by how nice it looked.  I was surprised, too, by how roomy it felt inside.  Even more surprising, I found the turbocharged four-cylinder more than sufficient and even fun to drive.  To top it off, I was impressed by the safety equipment.  The deal-maker for me was that I could get a new civic touring for less than a 1-2-year-old subaru (legacy or impreza) or a camry, and the resale value looks great.  I've driven the car over 8K and had it more than about 8 months so far, and I really have no major complaints.  I’ve found the CarPlay feature to be uncooperative ~5% of the time.

The car has plenty of torque to pass once the car is rolling. Lack of clutch feel is the only real complaint. I hope for a larger displacement engine in the future with a turbo.

It is an amazing car to drive. It has great acceleration for its class and is fun to drive. It is a nice looking car with good interiors and really nice dash. It gives great fuel economy and is fun to drive (which is a rare combination). It has cool technology features. It has almost everything that I would want in a car but yet I am rating it only a 3/5 stars. The main reason being the seats. The driver seat is not comfortable for someone short like me with back/neck issues. In my new Civic, my neck hurts really really bad. I tried all kinds of back supports and neck pillows. They help a little but still do feel very uncomfortable because of the forward inclining headrest. In spite of my issues, I would still highly recommend buying this car as it is a very good car.

1195, on 09/22/17 18:34 PM (PDT),Grimey ,2017 Honda Civic  Si 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Civic SI is awesome!," I had a 2012 Toyota Avalon, tired of the luxury scene and was looking for something fun to drive.  I read Car and Driver's review of the Civic SI and went to drive one...loved it.  Their review was spot on.  Obviously it’s not a luxury car, it's a sports car, so you have to enjoy being ""involved"" with your car as you drive the SI.  6-speed is all you get and the only option is whether you want summer or all-season tires...summer tires cost a little more ($300).  Mine has the all-season 18"" wheels and they're great.  As for complaints, I do agree with the other reviewer’s comment on the cup holders directly behind the shifter, but as long as your drink isn’t taller than a Coke can, there’s no problem.  The electric parking brake took a drive or two to get used to but otherwise I like it.  The brake hold option is awesome in traffic so on that one, great job Honda!  Personally, I only have 2 issues I’d like Honda to address: 1) Honda does not offer a leather or synthetic leather option...they should.  I do not like the material Honda chose for the doors or the center console.  The fabric is like a weird, soft burlap material that gets a sheen on it from friction or body oil/sweat.  In fact, every new car I test drove at the dealership already had weird white/shiny marks on the door’s arm rest and center console from previous drivers.  What I’ve found is that the material is hard to clean and I’m not sure if it’ll stand up to the test of time.  In the future, I'd much prefer an upscale soft plastic or leather/synthetic option to replace this odd fabric choice. 2) No auto-dimming rear view mirror.  For a car that sits so low in traffic at night with headlights blaring behind you, it's a necessity and should be standard or included with a leather/synthetic interior option.  Otherwise, for $23-24K, you just can't beat the quality and value in this little package.  By the way, I was going to go with the coupe, but I really needed four doors and the sedan is only 17 pounds heavier so the choice was easy.  Usually there’s much more of a weight penalty when you choose 4 doors...Since I've got a large family, the sedan works much better & I’m extremely pleased with the roominess of the back seat.  I’m 6’4” and while I’m driving there’s still room for a full sized adult in the back seat.  As for the engine, the performance is incredible for a 1.5L Turbo.  I drive highway mostly and see at least 38 MPG with a heavy foot (75 MPH average).  Honda, pay attention here...fix these small things and if you can’t offset or relocate the cup holders, consider making them deeper to accommodate Yetis & the like.  After that, this car is near perfect.  I know some buyers may not want a leather or synthetic interior, but at least make it an option and give your buyers a choice.  I would have happily paid an extra $1100-1500 for it.  Thanks for reading and happy driving!",5

1197, on 09/14/17 09:03 AM (PDT),Fran P. ,2017 Honda Civic  EX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl CVT),3rd Civic I've owned," Coming from an old 2003 Civic manual 5 speed, it feels a bit weird to drive the new CVT.  It almost feels like the engine has to catch (maybe it is the eco..not sure) as if I am driving manual. So the acceleration feels a bit lumpy sometimes as if the car has to lurch randomly, but very subtly.   The electronics are good. I notice a bit of lag from time to time, but other than that - it's a great addition to the car for long commutes.  When I bought my car brand new, there was an issue with my trunk.  I opened it, and after shutting it closed, it would not stay shut.  It would continually pop open on its own and beep twice.  I noticed the bottom part of the trunk weather strip was bent and distorted.  I forcefully had to shut it in order for it to stay - and be mindful not to use it until I went to the dealer to have it repaired (5 hours total.) 2 hours for diagnosis, then another 3 hours another day for them to replace it :( but I still love my car.  Feels fast, fun to drive, and lovely to look at.  I wish they put more care into the interior of the seats and console - as once you put your arm down, it leaves white residue so that will definitely wear down quickly over the years.  My other issue was I opened my trunk to inspect my car on the first night home and there were razer blades on the top of some parts.  I figure that's more the dealerships wrongdoing.  They admitted they use it to cut the tape and various parts off and forgotten them there. Nervous that they could've had more that have fallen into the parts of the car...but so far it seems fine.  The steering wheel makes a faint click click click noise when you turn it all the way.  Not sure what that is - but it does not affect the way it drives.   Overall, love the new car.  Going to go the extra mile to be careful with the interior because I feel like it will definitely wear down quickly.  Everything else is great - feels spacious and plenty of room to get in and out.  Trunk space is huge.  Love the details on the headlights and tail lights and the storage space in the middle console ! =)",4

I was torn between the CRV, Accord Sport, and the Civic EXT.  Boy, did I make the right choice.  For starters I am 6'4, and for anyone questioning the roominess, don't.  There is plenty.  This model is a head turner.  I have had more people ask me about this car more than any other I've purchased. I look forward to the next 3 years side.  And a side note, dealing with Keeler Honda and Adam Dorn was the best car buying experience I have ever had.",5

Reaction time is on point. Breaking and accelerating is very smooth. I wouldn't say acceleration is fast though. My family also owns a Toyota Camry and sadly the Toyota can accelerate faster. Not to much has happened. The screen has experienced some problems 2 months into me having the car. The screen would turn off and on then freeze on me. When i contacted the dealership that i bought my car from, they were very friendly and willing to replace the screen. Before i got the change to replace it though, it seemed to work completely fine again so i didn't replace it.",5

The car handles well and is roomy (I'm 6'2"") with plenty of space for passengers. I think the price I paid was fair and I would do business with my dealer again. Lots of cargo room too. The 6sp manual transmission is quick and responsive and fun to drive.Update: so now I have put close to 7500 miles on the Honda without any problems. It has snowed several times and my Civic handles it great. Using full synthetic oil means I still have 30% of oil life left at 7500 miles. One complaint is that after getting a car wash (power wash) my capless gas door got water inside and froze shut. I did not notice this until I needed gas. I had to force the gas nozzle into my tank. No damage and I have not had any additional problems with it once the weather warmed. Overall I am still very happy with my Honda Civic and would but it again.Update: I now have 13,500 miles and have no complaints. Everything is working great and nothing has failed. After thinking about my one complaint about the gas door, I think it was because of the type of car wash I went through, a high pressure water wash. I think a normal wash will not have this issue. We will see this coming winter.",4

1205, on 08/14/18 09:48 AM (PDT),Zurby ,2016 Honda Accord  Touring V-6 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Honeymoon wore off after a few months," Going to be a bit lengthy but wanted to express my thoughts on the 2016 Accord Touring. Coming from a 07' Pontiac Grand Prix GT (V6)   Looked for numerous months to find a fuel efficient yet ""sporty"" v6 sedan. Being 6' 2"" and 250 pounds it was actually hard! Many cars I didn't fit well until the Accord. Ended up getting the Accord Touring certified used with only 32,500 miles or so in November of 2017.  I was excited for all the upgrades that my Pontiac didn't have. Bluetooth, Navigation, Adaptive Cruise Control and a few other features. Actually little surprised Honda doesn't have cooled seats in the front or blind spot indicators in the mirrors. Based on all the other safety lane departure, brake system, etc. Honda guy said then you'd have to go to Acura. I figured I'd lived without it for 10+ years in the Pontiac so whatever. After owning the car for a month or so is when the horror show started and the honeymoon wore off. When driving to sell the Pontiac to a private buyer (too bad) I noticed one of the DRL (day time running light/ LED strip) was half blown on the Honda. I figured no worries ""certified/under warranty"" called up the dealer I bought it at (Honda in Schaumburg, IL)  RUDE Gal tells me its going to be $140 diagnostic fee... But refunded into the work on the new headlight assembly. I'm like no ma'am JUST need the LED Light strip... ""not available need to get the WHOLE headlight assembly"" $1,081.00  Yes people over ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS IF YOUR DRL GOES OUT. (Currently being investigated class action lawsuit) Eventually took to a new Honda dealer in Barrington, IL where they treated me much better and didn't charge a ridiculous fee for warranty work. FYI factory warranty was up at 36k miles and at that point was at 33k or so. Next warranty issue was the intermittently freezing touchscreen. Eventually got that replaced after dropping the car off a few times under warranty. I was getting pretty upset since I was just about to pass that factory warranty... another 1k for just the radio. So within the first few months of ownership car was in the shop 3x and over 2k in warranty work...    At this point I'm at 38k miles and have had it for 9 months (I don't drive much)   As many others have mentioned Stereo is pretty much crap. Turn up the bass and plastic in the rear deck rattles. Sounds pretty terrible in general... Flat/ no life to it. I've taken it upon myself to try and isolate by stuffing rags/ foam (helped a little)     Just hitting bumps in the road plastic rattles and makes the car feel cheap. The 6 speed transmission is just an absolute mess. Shifting at the worst times when accelerating/ decelerating    I can't say I hear it clunk when slowing down, more of a engine brake and quite the jerking feeling.   The accelerating is decent but often hits an odd gear and as someone said ""rubber bands"" you forward.   I've also seen complaints the car lurches in cold weather when accelerating with a 1-2 second delay. 100% agreed, has happened to me multiple times.  Honda just says ""it's the road""   Pontiac had no such issues on the same exact road. I definitely miss the volume knob but fortunately have the controls on the steering wheel. I'm pretty frugal with my $ and keep my cars for a good 150k ++ miles easy.  But this car has been so disappointing I've already thinking  about trading it in and losing my butt on it. The Mrs has a 14' Grand Cheerokee with the 8 speed transmission. Shifts like butter and fantastic acceleration with the v8. First and probably last Honda vehicle. Wish I kept driving the Pontiac to hold out and try something else.",2

1210, on 05/17/18 04:43 AM (PDT),Robert ,2016 Honda Accord  EX-L 2dr Coupe (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Liking Accord Coupe more and more," I bought this car new largely because of good experience with a ‘14 Civic Si 6-speed previously purchased and still owned.  The Accord coupe was viewed as a larger, more sedate version of that car that more reasonably fit me (replacing a Miata) than a Civic.  Initially I thought that the 4 cal Accord mated to the CVT with paddle shifters would be a mileage compromise over a V6 automatic, with better performance.  I’ve changed my opinion in that the CVT can function quite well as a simulated 7-speed and in that regard functions similar to other manumatics and doesn’t really remind you that it is a CVT.  Performance and economy of the 2.4L with CVT has been a pleasant surprise.  The coupe body style is handsome, but in retrospect the sedan is probably more than a bit more practical, but also less fun to drive.  The car is solidly reliable, fairly comfortable in a sporty way and certainly economical, but insurance costs are way higher than they should be (check those out before buying).  After driving a Ford Fusion Hybrid rental recently, I was reminded how much more road noise gets transferred with the Honda cars.",4

But no mention that I had to download it myself and it will take 2 hours on a flash drive and 2 hours to car.  Beside the directions are screwy and wants to send me all over just  to get to my home.  Last year Honda Dealer said they updated it but when I asked this year told NEVER able to update.  Also I was never told that it holds only 1 CD.  The car  paint  seems to get scratched easily.   I should advise against navigation better off buying one from stores.   My gas mileage going slower does not give me more mileage.   I get better mileage going 65 mph.,3

The beautiful styling and nice wheels stood out from other brands and models. After having my car over a year my LED daytime running lights went out TWICE and the dealership didn't want to replace them but mentioned that it was an issue from other customers. I paid almost 6 hundred to get them fixed even with Honda paying half of the repair cost. After this incident my a/c fan became VERY noisy and would constantly stop working. I had to get it replaced out of warranty. Besides these issues I like my car overall.,4

Part of the time I am on winding two lane roads, up hill and down with sharp corners.  The Honda handles REALLY well on this part of my drive and I enjoy it BUT, this automatic deceleration in the transmission is weird and a little annoying going down a steep grade.  3/4's of my drive is highway to downtown.  Some stop and go traffic.  Now I admit, I'm over the age of 50 and I sit behind a desk for a living.  While I don't have back problems there are nights when traffic is bad and it takes two hours to get home.  The seats in this car are why I bought it but I find that it just doesn't make the long road test perfectly.  I am uncomfortable and achy by the time I get home.  The seats aren't either firm enough of adjustable enough even with the lumbar support.  I love the techy nature of the accord and I LOVE the way it looks (the wheels are cool.  Seriously).  This is certainly a vast upgrade over the Prius I used to drive which felt like I was sitting on a cardboard box after a while but I recall a Nissan Altima that had better seats for the long distance.  When my lease is up, I probably will give this car up and go to either a Subaru or some other AWD vehicle that is somewhat comfortable.",4
1215, on 11/18/17 03:54 AM (PST),Misha Jovanovic ,2016 Honda Accord  Sport 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6M),The last of the true legacy Accord line up," I waited 2 long years to write this review; or should I said, 2 years from the moment I purchased the car. Being a avid car enthusiast, I got a hint through online forums and discussions that Honda will be moving to turbo engines in 2017 and going forward so I knew I had to act quick. I will elaborate...I have been driving Honda/Acura cars for the last 11 years, since I was 21. I won't waste time going into their reliability and quality, they have established that over the last 30 years. At the time of buying the 2016 Accord Sport 6MT, I was driving an Acura CL Type S 6MT and my secondary car was/is 1995 Accord EX 5MT. The CL was a great sporty car but it was aging (2003) and I wanted long term solution to my car situation as the 1995 Accord was pushing 250K at the time (currently is at 280K and rocking solid). I didn't want to wait for new generation Accords because I didn't want to go to turbo engines that are uncharted territory for Honda. I also didn't want another coupe like the CL and manual was a must so the natural choice came down to the Sport trim with the 6MT. I did several months of research and found that the 2.4 DI I-4 matted to a dual-mass flywheel clutch 6MT was a win-win as the engine has a timing chain instead of a timing belt and the dual mass flywheel clutch when driven hard but not abused under experienced driver (15 years of driving manual, since I was 16); that combo would provide close to 200K miles of no chain or clutch replacement needed, only minor tuning and maintenance on them. Both the 2.4 DI and the 6MT dual mass clutch are tried and true, no nonsense about them. On top of that, I wanted to get a 2016 model due to some great aesthetic upgrades, both inside and especially out. The inside for example, 2016 has red and black cockpit instead of white in 2013-2015, all black trim instead of grayish dash, phenomenal leather/steel shifter, aluminum pedals, etc. Outside there are so many improvements over 2013-2015 that I can't even count, especially those LED fog lights and 19 inch wheels taken from the Touring trim. To wrap this up, for the 2 years I've owned the car, I've only changed the oil 3 times (at 5K intervals, currently at 18K). That is literally it. The car is fun to drive, rock solid reliability, it's beautiful, it's attractive, it's got plenty of power, the 6MT is as good as a manual can be, AC is great, heat is excellent - basically, it's a complete car. What I also love about it that it's the last of the dying breed of simple interiors. No gimmicks, no space shuttle curvature of the dash, no goofy buttons, no LED RPM gauge; just classic interior with classic set up. It's truly a dying breed and cars like this aren't made anymore. Proof of that is the 2018 Accord, it couldn't be more gimmicky inside, starting with the aforementioned LED RPM gauge (cringe worthy). I should also mention that I talked the dealer down (spent a whole Saturday and half of a Monday there) to the invoice price; they frowned up having a manual car on the lot because they're a hard sell in Midwest Wisconsin, especially during winter months and it's a imported sedan. The fact I got it at such a great price makes it all so much complete. I will own this car for decades and plan on seeing it reach the same miles as my 1995 Accord (280K+).",5
1216, on 10/31/17 19:53 PM (PDT),Amer ,2016 Honda Accord  Sport 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT),2016 Honda Accord Sport," The Honda Accord Sport is a fun car to drive, gives you a smooth and agile ride. The vehicle has decent power but certainly not as much power as a Subaru WRX, Camry XSE, or Maxima. I enjoyed driving the Sport, no complaints in handling, response, acceleration, etc. I felt that Honda cheapened out in materials and amenities. The 19"" Alloy wheels look slick but easily ""curbed"" and one of the tires had a sidewall issue under 17,000 miles. In terms of Amenities, the entertainment is sorely lacking....a 4 speaker system with a weaker wattage head unit. Even the CRV EX comes with a better system. While the pseudo leather trimmed seats look nice, you can feel the lack of quality. Other amenities such as heated seats or a sun roof would have been nice. Overall its a nice vehicle but Honda could have made even more improvements.",4

This car is included. I bought it and was almost begged into buying the additional warranty, but thought it was just the finance person working extra hard. Apparently, he nee something that I didn't.  I'm not impressed by a car doing what it is supposed to do. It's when it doesn't work that's the issue. The dual screens have blacked out-meaning no back up camera. The screens have locked up as well as the radio so I was stuck listening to the same thing. My locks malfunction so the only way to get into the car is unlock it manually.  It has completely powered down/battery drained afer 30 min of radio listening on lunch -I didn't run the car full strength and had to call roadside assistance as my car -steering wheel and brake-locked completely.  I currently think that it is being held together by a string and bubble gum. Going to get rid of it. This will be the last honda that I will buy. My last brand new crosstour had to have an entire front axle replaced after 3 years. I absolutely hate this car",1

Remember though if you are looking for that luxury ride this is the sport, built with a slightly lower profile and stiffer suspension with the 19 inch wheels that complement the look and handling.

Starting from the buying procedures, do you have the car in stock ?

And i told them NO I AM GOOD they still tried hard to convince and the financing manager did not feel ashame to keep telling me about how good it is and it would cover more things that the 3 years manufacturer warranty would , cost is $2400 , i only said ok because i knew i have 60 days to cancell , !!! And guess what eveytime i go to the dealership to fix an issue the first thing they say , oooh this is not covered !! Really ! What is covered then ! I had problems with wheel alignment the car was pulling , took it 3 times for the same issue , oh its not pulling and COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM and bla bla bla BS , i said fine. I will do that on my own never mind , then they called and say oh the manager said he will do the alignment for you , its like they giving me a favoy! Oh nice thank you!!  And guess what. That paperwork that they gave me to show the alignment was performed was fake ! I still have the car pulling !! WTH !  When i boight the car i had a $1000 saving from a different dealer , but i still paid the $1000 extra for this dealership. !  The front and back suspension noise is very aggravating , you will feel like driving a tractor on a corn field!!     The gas mileage is low 22 mpg combined and now its getting worse about 15 !! They only say oh we cant do nothing about it ! Really ? Who can ? Toyota? Probably yes ! Wind noise at highway speed , mirror shaking a little at high way speed , smoke burning odor win accelerate all COULD NOT BE DETECTED!!  I think there is many fake reviews and ratings about this car !  they also offer me a FREE oil change to give then A GREAT feedback on a survey they would send to me ! Really. !? How about i will pay you double the price for your oil change and you just do honest work and service !  Never seen something like this before i owned 3 different vehicles and drove 7 different ones they were all used and never had an issue like this , this honda accord was brand new , tires and rims warranty was about $800  for 5 yrs or 100k miles , did not use so far , but we called once and they say we have to fix the wheels if we have an issue with them then they will send us reimbursement!!

After getting my wife a brand new 2016 Accord, I was surprised by how harsh the ride was, specially the rear of the car seems like it's riding on lowered suspension and I felt every bump on the road. I can understand having a sports suspension, however this was not the well behaved suspension I had on my Si! It transmits too much of the road's imperfections and it's definitely much worse than my old Si in handling the road's imperfections and transmits more of the vibrations to my back than the civic. And are we talking about a family sedan?! The worse is that the Accord nearly went airborne on the toll way with one of the bigger bumps, something that alarmed everyone sitting in the car (5) at that time. Wow... how did the Accord go from a family sedan to something I wouldn't recommend to anyone buying a sports sedan I don't know... bad Honda. This is definitely the worst riding sedan I've owned and driven from MB C, S class, to Ford's Mustang and CV.",2

1232, on 02/15/17 20:39 PM (PST),Tim Stockton ,2016 Honda Accord  Touring V-6 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Excellent on technology; falters on audio & shifts," Overall this is a very good car, but I have two main issues with it: the sound system is poor, and the transmission ""jerks"" the driver as it shifts. The sound system does not handle highs and lows of sound properly. I expect much more out of the ""premium"" seven speaker sound system I paid extra to add onto this car. On researching the issue, it is apparently inherent in the output for noise canceling in order to keep the care quiet. But it ends up making the audio terrible.  There used to be a solution to this as described on internet forums: what you would do is open up a secret menu on the screen, then set ""FLAT"" to off. But, in newer versions of the car Honda has taken the ability to modify this feature away. Thus I am stuck with this terrible sound. The second issue I have with the car is the transmission. When upshifting or downshifting there is a noticeable ""jolt"" or ""jerk"" to the car. This is FAR worse in cold weather. If you live in a climate that is cold year round, I would avoid purchasing this car. From what I have read, this is somehow due to government requirements to implement shifting to keep gas usage low (supposedly). Besides these jerks, the car with v6 engine does accelerate fast. Otherwise, the main way the car shines is with its tech. The lane sensing ability is pretty good at staying in lanes. If you let go of the steering wheel, the car will beep at you after about 30 seconds to touch the wheel again. You can get the car to fully take on lane sensing by just lightly putting pressure on the wheel but letting it do all the work. Careful on turns and at exits - it tends to lose its way. Adaptive cruise control is a feature I never knew I needed. This dramatically increased safety on the highway, highly decreasing your chances of hitting any car. But if you are in a high traffic area, best to turn it off. The car leaves too big of a gap in that case and lets other cars sneak in front of you. Then the car smashes the brakes to but another gap in between you. It's not too much of an issue once you get to know your car but can be annoying. There's a right sided blind spot camera that's neat but for some reason not one on the left side. If you accelerate toward a car to fast and get to close, an orange light beeps at you to warn you. It's helpful. The display panel interface is pretty wonky to use, not user friendly. Apple Carplay is an amazing addition (it's not easier to use by touch than just using your phone, but it does look very nice on the screen. The integration with Siri comes in handy. I find myself using it to navigate). The car seems to be tight on steering. Overall the car is very quiet. Bottom line, this is a very good car. But the problems with the sound system and transmission hurt its performance. At $30K for a V6 touring Honda Accord, I can't help but think I'd be better off with an Audi.",3

I love Pandora radio, The controls for everything technological are on the steering wheel, easily accessible controls. We have had a very rough winter. With studless snow tires this car is awesome in the snow and ice. I recommend getting Honda floor mats, they rise on the sides so nothing gets on the carpet on the floor, not even spills!

I mean, it is really fun to drive, FAST TOO !!. The car did have a defect in the roof that caused the car to stall out every time it rained. The car had to be towed 4 or 5 times until a HONDA Dealer figured out what was wrong and they fixed it. A leak in the roof was causing the Ignition relay to short out, it was by the Clutch pedal behind the plastic cover on the side of the fender inside the car. Other than this VERY UNUSUAL (according to the dealership) repair the car has had one thng that needed to be fixed and that is a speed sensor on the rear wheel, went bad and was fixed under the warrantty. I put 20,000 miles on the car in 10 months and drove and crove and drove it, getting an average 24.5 MPG's, and although I am not a ARCE CAR Driver, people for some reason always want to try to get me to race them, and the times that I have, I have literally blown the doors off of every car that has approached my HONDA ACCORD COUPE. a few BMW's, a Mercedes and a bunch of Audi's and one Mustang that was really funny.At this point I am either going to sell it for top dollar as the car is no longer produced in the COUPE model or keep it till the wheels fall off, either way it is a damn good car.",4
1237, on 12/26/16 10:14 AM (PST),Mohamed Ismail Nounou ,2016 Honda Accord  Touring V-6 2dr Coupe (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Horrible Car with worst experience ever," Dear all potential Honda Buyers and Honda Victims,I am speechless, disappointed and sad. I will tell my whole story in here, hoping to protect other customers and  hopefully to seek help, not for any financial compensation, but to alert others with the kind of mistake they could do to themselves and their families buying a BRAND NEW Honda and trusting them with your money and your safety.On December 30st 2015, I bought TWO brand new Hondas from Hoffman Honda in Connecticut (40 Albany Turnpike, West Simsbury, CT 06092). The Sales guy was Alan Katz. I bought a Honda CRV EX edition and a Honda Accord Coupe Touring Edition ($37,000). The CRV was for my wife and the Accord was for me (VIN: 1HGCT2B00GA001393). I work in Southwest VA. It’s a rural area. I used my Accord there for 5 months from January 2016 till May 2016 without any problem. The closest Honda dealer to me is Bill Cole Honda (http://www.billcoleautomall.com/, Big Laruel Highway, Princeton WV 24739, UnitedStates). I did oil change there. Suddenly in May 2016 the horror started.First, the check engine lights start showing. It showed for 10-15 minutes and disappear. This kept happening for two months. In July, it showed for three full days. I drove for 3 hours to go to the Bill Cole Honda. Then it disappeared. They told me the car is perfect. Two weeks later, it happened again and it was consistent. It was on when I went to the dealership. They tried everything to figure out what is going on. Everything showed ok, oxygen sensor, Vacuum lines, etc were perfect. They finally told me It could be the engine plastic cover (As the error showed at this time “Air Flow Problem”). They told me that it could have been the loose engine cover. They reset the software and let me go. I really wondered how a brand new car has a loose engine cover, but I let it go. Then in a month, it started to show again, and it was consistent. Again, I had the three hour trip to the dealership. At this time they claimed it could be the gas, although I use premium gas (I even have a proof for this via my credit crd statements). They charged me “$700” to drain the tanks and lines (Out of pocket) as it is my fault. I told them I have no problem paying it, if they think it is my fault and it is a gas problem. They reset the software and billed me the $700. I immediately filled a claim against Food City Gas Station for this bad gas according to Honda (All claims, and bills are available as PDF files upon request). Two days later, the check engine light appeared again with NO NEW GAS at all. At this point, I filled a claim with Honda Headquarters (Case ID: 05223195, Ext. 117754, Agent: Sharon). They recommended me to go to the dealership. I went in there, and they reset the software, claiming it could be trace gas trapped in the system. Again, after two days, the engine check light showed again. Sharon from Honda Headquarters dealt with me in the most insulting and horrible way. First, she closed the case without resolving the issue and reopened it after multiple calls and many days of avoiding me and filling lots of complains against her. Finally, they answered me, claiming that the phone conversation is recorded and asked me to drop the car again to the dealership. I drove three hours again and dropped the car to the dealership, where they claimed they can not do anything except waiting for a Honda Accord expert from California to come and check. They offered me a rental car free of charge. On the second day they called me to come and pick up the car, claiming that Honda declined sending an expert and claimed the car is perfect and they have no clue what to do. The maintenance guy (27 years of experience with Honda) took me on the side and told me “a small loss now is way better than a big loss later, and he shared with me how he has never seen something like this before). I immediately went to a Chevrolet Dealership and exchanged my car with another brand new one. I lost already huge amount of money. Food City sent me a report of how good their gas was at my gas station claiming it was not the gas problem. It clearly Honda quality problem. Every one in the dealership called my car the bad lemon. Guys, be aware, this is what I got from Honda, money loss, time loss, feeling unsafe and worst treatment ever. I have all this documented in paperwork. I am here to protect all of you. I also feel so bad for my Honda next buyer, If you are buying this Honda with this VIN number “1HGCT2B00GA001393”, GO AWAY, RUN. I do not know what to do really. I just feel so bad and disappointed. As an American buyer, how this can happen? Why no one is protecting us? I have all paperwork with me upon request. Aside from the problems, the car features (Touring Edition) are practically a joke. The Honda Sensing Technology is a JOKE. First it rarely works ant totally unreliable. It detects the road hardly 10% of the time. The Moving Lights is a BIG joke. Apple CarPlay is practically a PAIN.",1

Pros: Looks great, gas mileage on the highway is 34 mpg and 26 around town. Love the steering....almost a modified rack and pinion feel. The 6 cylinder has great acceleration, yet great regular gas mileage. Comfortable and good leg room in the back seat for guests. Trunk has plenty of space. What's not to love?  Cons: I've gotten used to the all touch screen electronics. I would prefer a modified tech package with some commonly used functions having buttons vs. touch. Touch often forces you to take your eyes off the road, although the radio volume and channel changes can be done from the steering wheel.  I don't miss my TL much - this car is a real winner. Honda should be using this great 6 cylinder engine in more of their vehicles.",5

It is the EX-L model with the V6 engine. This is the first new car my wife and I have purchased since 2003. We love our Accord! It is spacious inside, has ample trunk space and plenty of horsepower. With the variable cylinder management, sometimes will operate on four cylinders depending on driving conditions, and 6 speed auto trans, have had up to 37 mpg on the highway. Don’t notice any difference when it is operating on 4 or 6 cylinders. This car can go 400 miles on a highway trip on a full tank. Averages 26 mpg in town and 34 mpg on the highway.  It rides very smooth and quiet but, has a good balance in the suspension and has good handling. The radio operation set up is all touch screen, which took some getting used to, once set up though, you can control all of the functions on the steering wheel as you can with a phone. Like the front seat power seat memory feature so it sets up automatically if either my wife or I drive it. Have put over 11,000 miles on it, no issues and no complaints. Only two negative things I can think of: 1) Both the driver and passengers front doors open very wide for ease of entry and exit however, once entered and sitting, hard to reach door to close it. When entering, have learned to sit sideways, with feet on ground, pull door toward me to first stop, then swing my legs in and shut the door. 2) When wanting to put air in the donut spare, you have to remove the spare tire as it is designed to be positioned with the valve facing down inside the trunk well. These two negatives are not anything we cannot live with and overall, we love our Accord!",3
1242, on 11/22/16 10:42 AM (PST),Honda owner unfortunately ,2016 Honda Accord  EX-L 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Honda goes down hill," This is my 4th Honda and after owning this car for 5 months I truly will never buy another Honda again!!!!   What a joke.  I can't even believe this carries the name Honda on it.  I'm so disappointed with the car that I've tried trading it 3 times and I would be losing a substantial amount of money.  The car is uncomfortable on long rides, there is a rattling noise in the dash that just started last month and the service department can't fix it.  The gas mileage is not what is on the window sticker.  The acceleration on the highway is horrendous.  The only good thing about the car is the exterior styling.  Like they say never judge a book by it's cover.  What a mistake it was this time.  Looks like I will be going American for the 1st time.  Update***  I finally got out of the car.  What a terrible vehicle!  I’m so disappointed with Honda!!   I’ve since looked at the new design and it is by far the ugliest Honda Accord I have seen.  I don’t think I could drive another Honda Accord again which is very disappointing because I loved my other Honda accords.",1
1243, on 11/21/16 09:46 AM (PST),Shem ,2016 Honda Accord  LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Solid car for a decent price," ###Update 6/3/2018##Still loving the car's positive aspects and living with its' negative ones. Honda did take a look at the seals on the driver's side window and applied some sort of fix but that did little to quell the wind noise. The transmission still has a slight shudder. I have narrowed this down to be mostly under hard-ish acceleration and when going up anything more than a small incline. Honda did have a recall for the battery sensor for this car and it was taken care of at my local dealership. I have been using Honda's maintenance minder system to schedule services. While Honda claims that it reads a bunch of things to determine when to call for service, it seems that I the system calls for service at around every 10,000 miles or so. So far services have only been for oil changes and tire rotations. Honda has also switched to using full synthetic oil for this car.I use winter tires during the cold months. This along with the traction control system has made for uneventful winter driving, which is a good thing. In all but the worst snow of the season, the Accord acquitted itself admirably.A few rattles have appeared, especially noticeable in the dash and passenger side door. These only show up under the worst road conditions and I have not tried to track them down. Frost heaves and sharp, deep asphalt cracks left over from a rather harsh winter have taken a toll on cars and the Accord was not immune.I did purchase an Ultra Racing front upper strut brace for this car and like it a lot.I have the 2016 Accord LX. I bought it used with about 3000 miles on it from my local MN dealer. It was to replace my 2000 Honda Civic coupe that I had owned for around 13 years and it had 235,000 miles on it. Needless to say I am a Honda loyalist, but not one who is blind to Honda's faults. I test drove a CR-V and a Camry and this car and settled for Honda because I still like the 'feel' of the Accord better.  The car is still mostly Honda in how it drives and sounds. The CVT takes a little getting used to but is not bad overall. It gets excellent gas mileage, I average around 32-34 mpg in mostly highway driving with some city driving mixed in there. The power is excellent for a four cylinder but you will not be drag racing anyone out there, buy a different car for that. I love the exterior styling and I think it is one of the better looking Accords in recent years. Generally, I am happy with the car. That is all the good stuff. Now for the bad. This car is neither quiet nor particularly compliant in the NVH department. I am ok with that because having owned Honda cars for a long time I know they aren't always the best at NVH. I will trade the noisiness for the benefits in the handling department. There is, however, in my car a particularly annoying wind noise at the B pillar, right at ear level,  when the car is at highway speeds. This is on both the driver and passenger sides. I will have the dealership look at this and update the review based on what they do. Road noise varies depending on the surface and can become obtrusive at times. There is a vibration that this car has at idle and it might have something to do with accessories like AC/climate control cycling on and off. More troubling is a slight  vibration that can be felt in the steering and gas pedal during acceleration and at certain speeds on the highway. Time will tell how this resolves itself. Could be anything as simple as an out of balance wheel to as complicated as a CVT issue. Will update when I know more. The brakes are good and I can stop this car easily without jerking my passengers around. There is  also a fair amount of body lean in the LX model when cornering at anything close to aggressive speeds. With all these flaws I still love this car and I hope it lasts longer than my faithful old Civic.",4

First everyone needs to stop whining about the loss of the volume knob. The touch screen control only takes a few days to get used to and is now second nature. Next are so called noise complaints while I will admit heavy rains do produce a tapping near the B pillar it's easily ignored and minor. I've had a Toyota Camry, Jeep Cherokee, VW Jetta, and Jeep Wrangler whose roofs sounded like they were corrugated tin. Road and wind noise? They are a none issue I quote Car and Driver magazine ""At 70 mph we recorded a decibel rating of 66, the same as a Mercedes S class we tested."" Now onto the review if you are looking to enjoy the act of driving not just getting from A to B this is the car for you. If your looking to do it in comfort on a seat that feels like the leather chair in your living room in the perfect position relative to the controls and excellent view all around buy/lease this car. Matched to a buttoned down suspension, perfectly weighted steering wheel that at least gives some feed back compared to the numb detached steering in my last few sedans get the accord (I'm looking at you Kia Optima and Chevy Malibu.) Finishing up with the smoothest quick shifting automatic I've ever driven that shames these crap CVTs get to the dealership. Lastly it's a rocket putting your foot in it brings a linear rush of power that will leave most cars in your rearview. VTEC is awesome in the upper RPM range adding extra noticeable pull. Take a test drive you won't regret it. If mpg is your thing driving steady not slow had netted me an average of 28 city 31 to 34 highway not bad for this well engineered n/a V6.",5

The cabin is spacious and it feels like sitting  in the lap of luxury.  The adjustable lumbar support on the driver's seat is perfect. The back seats comfortably seat a tall person and the side windows allow them to look at passing scenery without craning their necks.  The Accord is a game-changer for safety. The side camera really reduces tension when changing freeway lanes or keeping an eye on bicyclists. .  I had to stop suddenly when a kid ran into the street.  The brake went down faster than I could  have braked and the stability assist helped me keep control of the car.  And. I love CarPlay navigation while streaming music.,5
1253, on 10/01/16 13:19 PM (PDT),John Gallagher ,2016 Honda Accord  EX-L V-6 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),2016 Certified Accord EX-L Outstanding Deal," This is my 9th Honda Accord sedan.  I love the car.  The only wart is the ride at times.  90% of the time the ride is good enough-handling is good.  10% of the time when the road is bad, the ride is very rough.  But I can live that.  The most important issue is transmission performance to me.  There is no delay that it makes it an unsafe vehicle like some other cars.  I owed an upscale Honda product-Acura TLX.  Mine was of 2015 vintage with 4,300 mile  when I sold it in September 2016 and I only owned it for a year.  I did not feel safe driving it.  A variant of the 6 cylinder with the 9 speed ZF was the powertrain.  That transmission strangled the 290 horsepower, and the VCM on top of the 9 speed completely neutered the Acura in question. The transmission shifted erratically and 4th gear took too long to engage. The Accord is not for everybody but for my being an Accord fan it is A- and just great.  I got this car as a Honda certified with 6,300 miles for with a pre-tax price within + or - 4% of trade-in value.  Clean CarFax and AutoCheck  accident free.  In service date of 1/12/16 - thus, 7 yr Certified warranty ends Jan 2023.  I got a wraparound First Automotive warranty that expires same day as Honda 7 year that includes a ton more components than the Honda 7 year powertrain warranty for a nominal amount.   The dealership that I purchased the car from was Rick Roush in Medina, Ohio.  The sales personnel, Tyler Roush and Tracy Hammond, were extremely helpful and did an outstanding job.  A recent listing for  a used identical vehicle in a different color was originally listed with a Ford dealer at $28,476-way too high a price.

I want to like it, and I do for the most part. I just haven't bonded with it like I did my last two Hondas. There isn't anything objectively wrong with it, I just don't feel a connection to it. It's just a car to me, one that I won't be sad to get rid of. The fuel economy is not what I had hoped for. I'm averaging just 24 MPG with mixed driving. Hopefully it will get better when I put more miles on it. The seats are not quite as comfortable as on the 2016 Civic, but they're not bad. Having Apple CarPlay is a fantastic feature that I wouldn't want to go without, but it does take quite a while to start up when compared to other vehicles I've tried it on. The back seats are comfortable enough for short trips, and the trunk is huge. A couple of things I don't like: There is a fair bit of wind noise that sounds like it's coming from the door seal right next to my ear. There is no volume knob. Not the biggest thing in the world because it does have volume controls on the steering wheel. Still, I'd rather have one. I'm also not a big fan of the glossy black trim on the inside. It scratches easily and always looks smudged.",4

I had very high expectation from upgrading from used up 2004 Accord to brand new 2016 EX-L model. I love the design and acceleration, CarPlay is cool.... This could be a perfect car, BUT I can not understand how Honda can ignore two simple issues, that just make me thinking that this is my last Honda. The first problem is wind noise. It is simply horrible, not better than any other car from 90-s. No improvements at all on trying to make it a little quitter, to match up with competitors. This is really annoying and doesn't make any ride enjoyable. The second problem appears when I try to eliminate the wind noise by playing loud music. Guess what, load music causes vibration of the whole rear deck with the subwoofer. The stop light is so close to the glass, that light vibration of the deck causes the plastic to vibrate and periodically with high frequency hit the rear glass. This creates annoying rattling noise. So I make the volume lower, but then I here annoying wind noise... Most importantly, the dealer agreed to repair both of these issues, that cost me nothing but loosing hours of my personal work time. Both repairs are not successful and it was just a waste of time trying to fix manufacturer's pour design. Btw, the dealer doesn't accept that this is a result of pour design.... They offered the repairs covered by warranty, but they all were not effective with no improvements. Such confusing situation. Even if I am willing to pay to fix it, I can't fix it and no one can! I had to do what I originally planned to do, buy a more luxury but slightly used vehicle, in which, at least I would enjoy the ride while paying more for the repairs....",3

I wanted a car that would be dependable and the Accord has a great reputation in that regard.  I purchased a 2016 at the end of the model year and got aprox. $4500 off the MSRP.  I purchased the LX with CVT, which is the most basic of the Accords.  I don't believe in buying a $20,000 car and adding a lot of gadgets to make it a $30,000 car.  With only 1000 miles on the dash, the car runs great.  having only driven cars with a traditional automatic, the CVT trans.  seems a little odd but I'm getting use to it.  It has a smooth and quiet ride. With the 4 cyl its not a race car, but the 6cyl only improved the 0 to 60 mph by about 1.5 seconds so I could not justify spending about $8000 more for the model with the V6.   Being the basic model it lacks the electronic seat adjustments which I miss a little.  I am coming from a 2013 VW Jetta TDI.  The Accord ride is softer and the steering is not as firm as the VW.  I don't have enough miles to comment on the MPG.  Over all a good value for the money.",5

Everything about this car is great so far however I was expecting a little bit more out of the miles per gallon.  It's not what I thought it would be but over all I would rate this car a 9 out of 10.  Courtesy Palm Harbor was a fantastic place to buy from, they don't hound you or lay a line of B.S. on you.  I made them an offer which no other dealer would even consider and they accepted it.  I strongly suggest making the extra trip to Palm Harbor if you are interested in a Honda because they will treat you right.  Just make them an offer but make sure it is reasonable and they will tell you yes or no.  That's the way car buying should be without the B.S. coming into play.  This was a stress free deal that I made with Palm Harbor Honda.  Buying from anywhere else is going to be a nightmare at best.  Trust me, I know because I contacted over 2 dozen Honda dealerships throughout Florida over the 5 months I was shopping.  Most dealerships would rather rob you first and sell you a car second.

The interior material quality is so far below what my old Camry had it's startling, but then that car was a 2002 ,so lots of ""water under the bridge"" since then.  There have been obviously many cost cutting changes since then.    At least the black materials conceals some of the cheapness while the tacky ash color option really hi-lighted it. (I'd still have the '02 if it hadn't been in an accident.  It was still running great for the amount I drive, and I loved it.)   The noise from tires or road noise makes me think there is a drummer under the car banging on twin drums.  It's quite intolerable, so I'll have to keep the radio on really loud to mask the din.  But the worst feature for me is the horrendous bucket seat which, despite constant efforts, I cannot adjust to be comfortable.  The 6 way controls just don't help.   Since when is sitting in a depression with your pelvis tilted backward ergonomically desirable.  Various cushions and pillows have not helped to date.  So I'm not sure what the next step for me is for this newer but certainly not better Camry.",1

1279, on 05/10/18 12:37 PM (PDT),Pamela DiCarlo ,2016 Toyota Camry  SE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),A car I can feel safe in," When I recently upgraded my car (Chevy Cruze) it was such a relief since it already had 3 significant recalls on it. This car was completely different, it is smooth, it  is quiet, the seat comfort alone is worth it. I love the seats because the driver seat is so adjustable that my boy friend who is 6 foot 3 inches fits in the car comfortably and I am 5 foot 2 in and after adjusting the seat I fit in perfectly. It has 6 or more different powered ways to adjust seat.  Plus I love the heated seats. I was shocked when I was reading the other reviews and the specs on this car though because it says that it has BLUE trim on the special seats but my car does not, it has RED trim on the cloth / leather seats. Which I did think was weird since the outside of the black car has the blue glitter in it that stands out, so I thought they would make it match but I love red so I'm not complaining. The interior though is my favorite I've ever had, I personally like cloth seats because I don't like to burn my legs with leather so the fact that it's cloth in the middle and leather on just the sides is great because it makes the side more sturdy for the lap belt rubbing on it and it won't get messed up so easy. My car I got used as a 2016 so maybe it has something to do with it but my exterior paint is not that fabulous, when I picked out my car  I went to the dealership in the evening so I didn't realize it was such a dull black, even with the blue glitter in it, it's pretty flat and a drab looking black. I'm going to try to wax it and hopefully that fixes it. It handles so well and it turnes so easy it's great to drive and the response is perfect. I always judge my cars on how good of a U turn it makes because I hate to make U turn at a light and have to back up and go forward again,  this car can make a great U turn. As far as gas goes...  my last car got really great gas mileage and maybe this one does too but it's not what I was used to so it's okay. Even still a much much better car, I'd say the best car I've had.",4

I love the exterior styling a lot but I don't fit inside as I do in my 2000 model. The interior is just smaller.

I hit my elbow often when turning.  I drive for 20 hours each week and I'm constantly thinking about what I'm going to do with this car - keep it or trade it for something more comfortable. It's really disappointing given I loved previous Camry version. Have no idea why they changed them.

1286, on 12/21/17 10:17 AM (PST),Mark Nolette ,2016 Toyota Camry  LE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),The disappearing car...," The 2016 Camry is a car for people who don't like to think very much about their cars, or worry about them. It's for people who want to just get in, turn the key, and go, with a minimum of fuss. The Camry isn't designed to call much attention to itself. For one thing, there are too many of them out there. For another, they never win styling awards. That being said, the 2016 Camry (largely) fulfills the time-honored Camry mission.    When I bought this LE, I found the ride to be surprisingly stiff, but it did smooth out after a few weeks. The ride is quite good in nearly all circumstances. The car has generally been quiet, though it lets in a little more road noise than Camrys typically did.  Reliability has been rock-solid. Not a single issue in 40k miles thus far. Performance may not glue you to your seat, but it's more than adequate for driving, passing, hill climbing and merging. Fuel economy has been good as well. My driving is mainly on two-lane rural roads, and I average over 35 mpg overall. On a typical 20 mile trip on a rural road, I frequently get 40-44.  Handling is appropriate to this car's intended mission: good enough for typical driving, perhaps a bit better than its reputation would have you believe. Interior materials seem less ""luxurious"" than the Camry or Accord of 10-20 years ago, but are adequate. The driver's seat is comfortable enough for long drives. Visibility is very good. My iPhone pairs easily with the car's Bluetooth. Sound quality from the audio system is decent; perhaps slightly above average for cars of its kind. The trunk is large and easily accessible.  To my mind, this is one of the better-looking Camrys to come along. That may not be saying much, but I can say that I actually like the looks of this one. My dealership sold this one to me at a great price (4k under MSRP) and has given me outstanding service since then. This car does show signs of cost-cutting here and there, but overall feels pretty solid.  Will my next car be a Camry? I don't know. But I have only good things to say about this one. Toyota could have done a better job of tuning out road noise  and could have put better quality materials in the interior. Those are my only complaints. Good car, good value.  It really does ""disappear"" under you as you drive it. It just does what it's told. No fuss. No worries.",5

It's a cheap family car with high safety, low insurance, and bland styling.. But it really has always been this car, they have made a few hot one's over the years in very low numbers, but the formula has always been what it is. The 2016 camry is really a failed attempt at the most simple Camry formula.. Decent looks, good build quality, high quality parts, and Decent driver interaction.. This has been the simple formula going back to the camry Vx70 which was the original Celica Camry here in the USA.. Before it got it's own US Platform.. The 85 Camry i owned, started life as my father's and was handed down to me at 173K miles, it was silver, with a very supportive, ultra high quality interior fabric, the dash looked textured, and was a thick rubberized plastic, which actually felt expensive, and like a high quality car.. It was slow, at 90hp, but it was fun to drive, it handled well, and was very easy to see out of.. In 1991 another family member bought a new Camry LE v6 which was also another car with fantastic seats, great handling, and offered a competent comfortable ride.. I expected the same when i purchased my 2016 Camry SE.. I wanted the good sounds of the nakamichi stereo's of the 80's, i wanted the adequate hp of the 91, and the handling, performance, and easy visibility that the older camry got.. What i ended up with though was a poor imitation of a buick..  The seats are hard, cheap, and the material feels like something they found at the dollar store, the dash rattles, the stereo is the entune which gets generic paper speakers, the handling is terrible, the ride is harsh for no reason, the electric power steering is slow, and can't keep up with spirited driving, you can't see out of it, and frankly the automatic transmission is just terrible.. The 2.5 is a gem of a 4cyl engine, but everything attached to it, just isn't up to par for a toyota.. I feel like the camry went from a BMW fighter for the middle class to something that only resembles the actual camry by nothing more than name.. This isn't my only toyota, but frankly it is my last new one.. I would rather put the time into repairing a 200+K mile early toyota than make payments on another appliance..

It's just an appliance on wheels..," Good:  It's reliable, hasn't had a single ""mechanical"" issue, it's nice looking and the paint is very good.. The interior look is sharp, and the exterior looks good too.. The accord IMO, which in 13 and 14 were one of the sharpest cheaper sedans around, have gotten way ugly with all the chrome, so a camry felt like a better solution, it is very cheap to run, and insurance is nearly free, the navigation system is actually pretty good, and the upgraded radio sounds very good, you get a lot of nice things for the money.. being a toyota it will likely run 300K miles without any major issues.. (But do i want to keep this one that long?)..  BAD: The seats are hard and uncomfortable on long trips, the plastic in the dash rattles, and the glove compartment doesn't want to stay closed when it's cold out (I have 6,400 miles) The speedo doesn't actually display the right speed, you can set your cruise at 40mph, your analog will indicate 45mph, and your digital will show 39mph, while GPS shows 42mph.. who really know's which is right, the factory tires are crap, they are loud, they are also awful in the snow and rain, the lack of a traditional ebrake is really annoying in bad weather, and the automatic transmission in anything outside of just ""D""rive is pretty useless, the ""Sports"" or SE model supposedly gets sports suspension, i am still trying to figure out what 90 year old typical camry drivers think the camry is sporty, it rides rough, won't corner, has epic body roll, and is really not at all sporty, my 01 sienna would drive rings around it in the corners.. it's like driving a 90's buick.. with roller-skate wheels.. in addition the outside panels are rolled out of foil.. if you sneeze too close to the car the panels will dent.. I expected much more from a toyota, after having multiple ones make it over 400K miles, it looks like my next car will be a hyundai.. Which i should have bought, but didn't because i expected the perfection of a toyota i have grown to expect..",4
1297, on 01/31/17 18:37 PM (PST),Andy ,2016 Toyota Camry  XSE 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Superb !!! Except for the JBL Premium sound.," The XSE V6 is an excellent car. Super impressive Engine, performance and handling. I cannot fault anything on the car EXCEPT the JBL ""Premium"" Audio. It is utterly unacceptable and poor. The rear speaker has barely anything going to it, almost no bass, (or any sound at all) comes from the lower door speakers, I would say upwards of 90% of the sound, (bass included) is directed to the high in-dash speakers. Volume? With volume set at Max, you can hold a normal conversation in the front seats without raising voices. It is utterly pitiful. No power, no volume, no bass. During preparation for production, one person, somewhere in the Toyota organization, would have probably been responsible for making the decision to go ahead and include this system, and to label it as ""Premium Sound"". This person should be fired. Then the fact that somebody in Quality didn't listen to it and check it afterwards, baffles me. EVERYTHING about this car is excellent, except the music. Absolutely, buy the car (XSE V6), but be prepared to immediately get a stereo shop to rip out the pitiful, impotent sound system, and replace it with something louder than your average bedside clock/radio alarm clock. Premium sound? Really, Toyota? Premium?? Not even on the same map.",5

Push the button that disengages the TCS, and drive (safely), feel the oversteer. I absolutely love the fact that at 70 MPH, up a steep grade of 7%, I can put the pedal to the floor, drop to a lower gear, and accelerate to 80, and pass safely. This car is most certainly ""quick"" when you need it to be. It feels like it predicts what you need in the moment and responds appropriately. The fun part is, this car is also ""fast"". I have gone from a dead stop to the floor in this car multiple times, and every single one was different (which is why I wish it had a sport mode, and possible launch mode in sport {hint hint, Toyota!}). This car actively adapts to recent driving patterns, which I think is amazing. This is my daily driver. Tech is there, fuel economy is there, space is there. I know I should drive a Mazda for my driving experience, but there is no comparable model made by Mazda that satisfies all of my needs at the same time like this vehicle. I intend to own it for a very long time. (P.S. Toyota, when you allow this car to function in a ""Sport Mode"", tone back the power steering, and let the driver feel the road a little bit more :)!",4

The car has been in the garage for a week and I took it out last night and to my surprise what a crappy, bumpy ride - I literally pulled off the rode to see if I had a flat. Took it on highway and the more I increased the speed the bumpier it got, the seat cushion is so thin you feel like you are seating on nothing and feel every bump from the road and the steering wheel vibrates to the rough ride as well. We have the car a week and I called the salesman last night and emailed him this morning. I hope I have some options to turn this back for a different car because I hate this car and shame on toyota for building such a piece of crap.",1

The problem with this car versus my other Camry's is the materials used in the front bumper and the under skirting is all plastic. I am very particular about keeping my cars detailed and if I would have really looked this car over I probably would have looked for something else. The front bumper just cracked approx a foot in front of the right tire. The crack is approx 2"" in length. I took this to the collision department at the dealership and was told this was going to be a problem with this model because of how low the bumper is and how thin the plastic is. This showed up after having the car for just 2 months. Today I go out in the garage and look at a new crack at the plastic mud flap on the right side in front of the rear tire. I actually got under the car and when looking at the undercarriage it looks no stronger than a Tonca truck. I serviced my own vehicles and was under each vehicle and know that this vehicle doesn't live up to the Toyota standards that I had become used to. Going to the dealership tomorrow and voicing my dissatisfaction with this vehicle. Update.... I just had the plastic grill replaced under warranty due to the paint flaking off.

This well equipped XLE's sedan's  performance is fine with us.  Very good engine response and a comfortable interior for the long ten hour drives.  Radio wise, strongly suggest that  you turn off the surround sound option since this greatly improved the listening quality to hearing music.  The GPS system is pretty good but Google Maps is more precise.  For a house number, Google Maps get you to the front door.  Camry's will get you close by one to houses away.  Providing verbal commands, the system does not always accurately catch it.  Perhaps my Bostonian accent?  The headlights are excellent. The side mirror detection alerts that another vehicle is my blind spot is a terrific safety feature.  For carrying stuff, it offers a very good trunk size and the rear seats fold down. too.  Gas mileage, for this six cylinder engine, it is about five MPG less than my 2008 Camry with six cylinder engine.  WHY?  I don't know but I expected it to be same.  The car is pretty is quiet.

Transmission is not performing (because Camry is too heavy for it?). I am not impressed with gas mileage as well. With my 2009 Camry I used to get 23 mixed and 30 on Hwy (better than the sticker). Now gas mileage is below the sticker. Toyota didn't do good job on the engine-transmission side. Design is weak: looks like old Lexus ES (I understand a lot of us kinda proud of this fact, but you could get an old Lexus ES for 1/2 of Camry's price but with 3.0L engine).

The seats are a bit hard to get used to.  It took a long while to find my sweet spot.  I'm 6'2, not that tall.  It handles nicely, and rides about the same. Road noise is noticeable.  I  hope that it lives up to its reputation of quality, for that will be its best virtue.   Unless one drives like an old geezer, the MPG never comes up to the EPA estimate.  By old geezer, I don't just mean obeying the speed limit, its a given that one obeys the law.  I mean coasting up to stop signs to save gas, as well as trying to time the lights in order to avoid applying the brakes at anything over 25 MPH.  As an aside, for the first six years that I owned my Altima, I loved it.  I don't love this car, but it's nice enough. It hasn't given me any trouble, but I only have 8k on it 😀",4

Chassis is tight and steers good, Car is quiet even on the Freeway. Dislikes: I am 6'2"" and the legroom for the driver is ok but the center console is too wide causing my right leg to be forced against it and it becomes pain-full after a half hr or so and then it becomes hard to find a way to get it comfortable. Older Camry's had narrower consoles and when I drive an older one I have no problems. I have the upper optioned radio and I agree with others that it really is bad. No depth to the sound, I would guess it has low wattage and cheap speakers. The NAV system Toyota owns called scout  and it is really bad. Voice command is useless and often, more than not it does not get you to the front door of your destination but will leave your a block or two away at times. It has traffic app in it and it does not do anything, maybe Toyota plans to make this work in the future or something. We have pretty much resorted back to using Google NAV on our phones again. Don't get me wrong. For the money I still believe this car is a good value and plan to own it for a long time. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase.",4

I complained to the dealer and they put new tires (top brand) on the vehicle and it helped some but you cannot get your money back.  Since I am stuck with this vehicle, and the resale value is not good, I will continue with it until I can afford another vehicle.  I still advise that you thoroughly test drive one before buying.

My wife has had RAV4's in the 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 generations. She loves them. I really wanted a new Accord. I was looking at the 2017 Sport. Not the Sport SE. No matter how many times I drove a 2016 I simply could not deal with the CVT. Now to be honest, there were traits the Accord had that I really preferred. Specifically handling and front seat comfort. However, my SE while no sport oriented midsize sedan is very satisfying. I only have 1,200 miles on it but as my wife's RAV's have been, I have not noticed a single manufacturing issue. The interior IMO is no louder than an Accord. My SE has the lousy Bridgestone Turanza 400's and they account for 75% of any road noise. So, I'm really liking this purchase. It's plenty quick enough for me. Has very strong brakes IMO, and can easily maneuver in any situation I might find myself in. I expect it to be bulletproof as 98% of Camry's are, and It was $2,800 less that the Base Accord Sport CVT would have cost me. Highly recommended.",5

1323, on 08/12/16 07:44 AM (PDT),Jim K ,2016 Toyota Camry  XLE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Still NOT VERY GOOD," I owned a 2001 Camry for over 13 years and used to be a Toyota fan, not any more.  After owning this particular Camry for three months I find it mediocre at best.  The three worst problems are; ROAD NOISE, NAVIGATION (Voice commands) and FRONT SEAT COMFORT.  These three problems, alone, make road trips terrible.  The road noise level is so high that to hear the radio, the volume needs to be very high.  The Voice command feature is unusable at highway speeds due to the road noise. Combine this with the seat comfort and I don't want to take long trips.  I guess you need to go to a two week course on using the navigation system.  Nothing is intuitive, I guess that you can do a lot with this system but finding information, while driving, is difficult at best (I'm still trying to learn this system).  There are several other smaller problems; the display screen is washed out during the day by the sunlight, the digital speedometer does not match the needle speedometer and other small issues.  Keep in mind this is the XLE Camry (one step below the Avalon) and should much much better.  I hate to admit it but I rode in a Nissan Altima yesterday and found it much quieter and more comfortable than my Camry (I have never been a Nissan fan, maybe should re-evaluate the Nissan).  I'll take my 2001 Camry LE over this one any day.  I fail to see why this Camry is rated so high by many people, confused!UPDATE (2/19/2017):Letters were sent to Toyota Headquarters in California and to Southeast Toyota headquarters and were ignored.  Took the car to the dealership for service and was basically ignored (you can show them and demonstrate the issues and they just shake their head and say they don't see a problem, must be corporate brainwashing).  Was so disappointed with this car that I traded it in for a Mercedes in November 2017 (lost money on the Toyota, of course).  My advise is to rent before you buy to really get to know the car.",2

I have had my Camry for 5 months and have had trouble with both back windows.  Toyota is rufusing to fix this under the warranty because I had the windows tinted and altering the Windows nullifies the warranty.  Toyota actually tried to blame the company that tinted the Windows. So I got a statement from the window tinting company that Toyota is wrong and the reason the Windows are malfunctioning is because of defective rubber seals installed at the factory by the manufacturers. Shame on Toyota.,5

The ground brakes freezes and Steering Freezes. The Shift from Parking to Reverse is too hard . You feel like ripping the interiors of the shift box. The vehicle accelerates when you attempt to apply the brakes . The entertainment system is the worst. Doesn't Navigate through folders. Doesn't even play songs in the same folder when using USB drive(download mp3 songs from various sources and try yourself). You have to do all of them manually. The rear windows give a grumbling noise while rolling down as if you are rolling them  on stones. Vehicle is barely 3 months old and you know what, Toyota takes pride in declaring all of them as designed to the needs and nothing is a defect and so they dont care.  And Toyota declined to give me copy of the dealers reports nor any access to  the Case i raised, neither in an  email nor on the Toyota website. They already performed 1 recall in month of May on my vehicle and i see 2 more new recalls on this site. This new defect piece is no match to my old used Honda Accord. They are just washing off the hands saying some customers may not like the features(wondering can there ever be any customer wanting to have the above defects?) and trying to pass on the time till the warranty is over.",1

We have been impressed with the quality and reliability of the Camry product. No major repairs on any of them, just routine maintenance. We took this new 2016 on a 1,600 mile vacation with no problems and the car handled very well. This year's SE rides smoother than our 2013 SE, maybe because of the 17 inch tires. The cab is quiet too. New features on this model include the back-up assist camera, which is a nice feature. The interior is nice and the finish materials are a step up from recent models.

I am 6’4”, with a bad back and while the car is lower than the SUV I had before it’s door opening is big so there is no head banging getting in and out. The transmission is a very smooth easy to use device that just makes you feel connected to the car. The hold feature which I do not need takes all the worry of roll back while starting on a hill. The reason I bought this car was not just because of Honda resale and dependability but because it makes driving fun. I have taken three long trips and on each I had tanks of 43.6 mpg. Never on a long trip have I gotten below 39mpg. Around town I am getting 32-36 mpg never below 32 mpg. Also this engine comes alive after 3500rpm.

One, I will NEVER buy a new Honda again.  Second, it forced me to go out and see what other quality vehicles are being made and boy, everyone else does it better now.  Honda is riding on reputation only and it a flimsy one at best.  Do your research and you will see how far Honda has fallen.  This car should be pulled from their lineup and redone.  The only redeeming part of the car is it looks good and has good acceleration - other than that it is the BIGGEST POS I have ever bought.  I had to sue Honda in order to get my money back - 18 trips to the dealer in 18 months for 2 issues - one minor and one major.  The minor issue was a design flaw with the rear Subwoofer - bounced the rear window and deck and never sounded good - after MULTIPLE TIMES to the dealer, Honda said, flat out, we will not fix this anymore, even though it's under warranty and still not performing properly (Huh?).  The second one and this a major issue - the ""info-tainmaint"" center NEVER worked correctly - Honda's answer ""when it doesn't work right, turn the car off and turn it back on"".  Because that's a reasonable thing to do when you're driving 65mph down the highway.  Long story short - go elsewhere.  I replaced this POS with a beautifully performing Subaru (was SHOCKED at how nice it was) and as soon as I can, I will be getting rid of my 2016 POS CRV (junk and OVERPRICED).",1

The eco boost makes this car a death trap. It failed five times in a 6 month period..whereas I was almost killed while either in a uturn or simply pulling into a place. The eco boost has what is known as a ""dead spot"" in a middle of a uturn you push the gas pedal and it just has dead spot where the engine chokes..or either you are changing lanes on the expressway. Honda and nhsta are both ignoring the problem. Also if you are rear ended the seats are so hard it feels like a piece of plywood hitting you in the back. Such a nice car to have such horrible hard seats...and the death by eco boost. Ford recalled their eco boost...Honda will not. I just wonder how many drivers have been killed by the Eco boost?",1
1352, on 12/27/17 17:35 PM (PST),Charles ,2016 Honda Civic  Touring 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),"Perfect, on paper."," On paper the 2016 Civic Touring checks all the boxes of any car shopper. Stylish, roomy, powerful, efficient, loaded with technology and safety features. In reality the Civic is less a bargain than it was in the past.My biggest gripes about the car are things that Honda could have easily remedied but chose not to, probably to save on costs.The largest three are the excruciatingly uncomfortable seats, the slow and cumbersome infotainment system and the “safety” features that actually make the car less safe. Top this off with sub-par build quality, leaves the Civic severely lacking.The seats are the largest issue, while having just enough padding (though firm) and good lateral and vertical bolsters they lack adjustable lumbar support, even in the top of the line Touring model. The fixed lumbar support is in the complete wrong position for my back and pushes out too far, leaving me constantly shifting positions to try and have my back hurt less. Even after short drives I’m often left with back pain. The lackluster Android based infotainment system. While a great idea in theory, the SoC that Honda decided to use with this system seems to be on par with with a cheap no-name-brand tablet than a decent smartphone.It’s completely overmatched for what it has to handle, between controlling both the gauge cluster and the infotainment screen it lags, often taking 5-10 or more seconds to bring up a new screen or switch to backup camera or lane view mode. Along with this Bluetooth connectivity is unreliable at best, call audio is often garbled and phones will randomly disconnect in the middle of audio streaming and calls. The system would also crash constantly until an update was applied in early 2017. I would hope that possible future updates could help remedy some of the issues, but I don’t count on it.The third largest glaring flaw is how Honda implemented the Honda Sense safety features, the Edmund’s editor called them sensitive, to the point of annoyance. I personally think they go beyond that and actually make the car less safe. The radar cruise control often drops too much speed when sensing a car in front of it, sometimes to the point of applying the brakes heavily when there is no need to, then yo-yos back up to speed again. There is no ‘follow’ function as in other systems, and no way to override the radar and control the cruise manually. The lane keeping and departure systems are downright dangerous if not payed attention to closely, it has an especially hard time with left exits on the freeway and will attempt to steer the car into the median if not corrected immediately. The cherry on top of all these flaws is the complete lack of build quality, everything in my Civic rattles. Several points in the dash, the passenger door, the sunroof, something behind the rear seat. The dealerships have been helpful to a point, but I don’t have much faith in having them find and repair all of them. The original set of center vents in my particular Civic would lose their positioning whenever the car heated up on the inside, leave it in a parking lot on a hot day and when you return the vents would be pointed at the roof. This was eventually address, but took several trips to the dealer to resolve.Overall, I would not recommend the 2016, or 2017 Civic until Honda does some serious updating to the car. There are lots of choices for small cars out there, and most of them are better than the Civic.Pros:- Modern styling- Powerful and efficient 1.5 ltr engine - Very Spacious interior and trunk- lots of technology crammed inCons:- Extremely uncomfortable seats- No lumbar adjustment, at all- Laggy, and buggy infotainment system- Safety features that are anything but safe- Very poor build quality",2

1354, on 10/10/17 09:28 AM (PDT),Emma ,2016 Honda Civic  LX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Great Buy for a Young Adult," I'd just like to start out by saying BOTTOM LINE this is a GREAT car, but this specific honda vehicle is great for younger generations for a lot of reasons. 1) It's a very nice looking vehicle for the price tag. While young people like nice things, they don't always necessarily have the means or years of experience to afford luxury models. This particular new design is a generous compromise. Both the exterior and interior appear very sleek. 2) Young people need reliable cars for the same reason as I pointed out in #1. They usually don't have the financial cushion that older generations may have. I've owned the car for about a year now with no complaints. Granted, time will tell but the Honda symbol on the front is very comforting. 3) Young people like to have fun on the road but of course not too much fun. The steering is very precise and makes handling the car a breeze. The ride is smooth with the exception of a giant hole in the road here and there (sarcasm). The acceleration on the 2.0 is OK. I'd say it's better than average but that's to be expected. To sum it up, you'll have a good time driving it but don't expect to be compared to Lightning Mcqueen.",5
1355, on 10/09/17 10:38 AM (PDT),DNFL ,2016 Honda Civic  EX w/Honda Sensing 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Good Can ALWAYS Be Better," Purchased September 2016-Within my first week my car was pouring out oil from an apparent defective oil filter. Within the first few months I had to manually unlock my car because the car/remote were not communicating, and the dealership could not find a cause during the multiple times they’ve done diagnostics. Now a year later, I still have occasionally electrical issues like when the keys are still in my pocket and the proximity alarm sounds and the walk away feature does not engage, so I have to manually press the lock button. My road departure & lane assist has activated multiple times even when I’m not near a line or drifting. I also feel the MPG is inaccurate despite how it’s collected; even on an hour highway drive, with adaptive cruise, though open highway so virtually no slowing, I still have yet to see anything get close to the 40 MPG mark. Now, ECON is on as well as a 72 degree climate control, and if that is what is causing 10 MPG off a gallon then I would say that’s excessive, NOT economical.  I am also STILL working with Honda and the dealership to fix my visors; I believe they are defective (too loose especially when telescoped). I get hit in the head every time I make a left turn which at first was extremely distracting and dangerous, which now requires me to hold it back. The passenger visor has already slammed into the rear view mirror, which is nothing like I’ve experienced before. All of these issues is requiring me to spend way too much time at the dealership getting things fixed rather than any regularly scheduled maintenance.",4

However, mark my words, it will not drive the cheapest, feel the cheapest, or look the cheapest in the slightest. This car is  such an absolute bang for your buck, I don't understand why anyone would get anything other than the newly redesigned Civic. It will crush the Cruze, Sentra, Mazda3, Camry and really any other car in this segment, did I mention I can get upwards of 44MPG's in my car?

My wife thought we needed a sedan but now that she has driven the car, she is very happy with the coupe.  It is a one of a kind Touring since it has the body kit added.

I mention this as I was thinking about getting a different car make and model from another manufacturer, but the exterior mirror placement was not my style.  I've not had a chance to do any service or maintenance, let alone fill the gas tank.  My teenage son has already called dibs and says he really, really likes it.  We've had different cars and have gone back to Honda as it has a reputation for reliability, longevity and for holding its value.

I had to tow it to the dealership where I bought it and they reviewed the car and found the TCM had been disconnected so they reconnected it and I went about my day. Then the error occurred again during a move and drive down to Florida. When we stopped to fill up and I turned on the car the issue happened again. The part apparently needed to be completely replaced because the pins meant to keep the TCM connected had been faulty. Please be aware of this and HONDA please place a recall/replacement on this issue. Several other people I know have had this same issue on brand new Civics. Being stranded and in need of a tow is dangerous and frustrating. PLEASE RESOLVE THIS ISSUE!!!!!,3

I cannot skip forward on Audio Books using the car controls. Defective Touch Screen was replaced within one day by Dealer free of charge. Too bad there is no indication that the new replacement is any different then the bad unit before it went bad. I highly recommend this vehicle as it rides smooth and gets super gas mileage. MPG starts at 30 when cold and goes to 35MPG after 5mins of warming up in the city then I have seen over 45MPG on the highway while still providing significant acceleration. Short couple mile city trips I still get over 30MPG. It's easy to AVG 35MPG. Turbo Engine uses regular fuel. The quick Fuel feature is so nice, no gas cap needed. Compared to the old 2007 Honda Civic I had this is more comfortable, better MPG, Faster, Quieter and all around better. Honda just needs to address the electronic quality issues. You get a lot for your money when buying a car that sell over 300,000 units per year including easy cheap maintenance costs. Also that makes for more negative comments as for the same percentage of defect rate there are more cars so I would not let that scare people away.",5
1365, on 04/06/17 16:17 PM (PDT),Mike Greer ,2016 Honda Civic  EX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl CVT),I hate this car," My biggest complaint about this car is the transmission. If you ever need to slow down quickly then speed up, forget about it. It's like the transmission is stuck in high gear for a second before it decides you're done stopping. I had a close call once because of this. A minor complaint about the transmission is the knuckle dragging fake shift points, it's controlled by the computer there should be an option to turn it off.  Another issue is the anemic horn, that sound like a dying giraffe, which I blame for not being able to prevent an accident. The entertainment system is the opposite of ergonomic. The angle of the screen is terrible for a touch screen and several buttons are too small for arms reach. The mute swipe is hit or miss and slow so some times I'll try to mute twice and then it'll mute and unmute. The screen changes and animates for about a minute when I start driving which I find annoyingly distracting.  The parking brake is not very usable especially if you are in an emergency and your fine motor skills go out the window. Also why do you have to push the break to release the parking break? The seats are so curved, they force you to slouch. Other then these issues the car is OK. It drives on the freeway nicely, mileage is good and it has plenty of trunk space.",4
1366, on 03/31/17 22:57 PM (PDT),Chris McConnell ,2016 Honda Civic  EX-T 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),"I love my new Civic EX-T, but it can get better"," The style both inside and outside of this car are great and a huge improvement. The engine is the best one in the segment and delivers impressive power for 1.5 L motor in an economy car. The CVT is also far less annoying than previous iterations of this device (I'm a fan of a manual trans, but I deal with too much traffic to want to drive a stick in my everyday commuter). The car handles well and is fun to drive.  It comes well equipped with a decent stereo,  a decent infotainment system, heated seats, moonroof, etc.  Forgive the run-on paragraph, this website won't accept carriage returns. There are some areas with room for improvement. The infotainment system needs a proper software update to simplify the menu structure, allow seamless handsfree sending of text messages. I tell it send a text to my wife that I'll be home in xx minutes, and it starts spewing back random numbers. Installing Android 7 in my S-7 did enable it to reply handsfree to a text after I receive one and the system has read it. No hardware needs to be modified, this is purely a code upgrade. The brakes offer good performance unless you head down a long steep hill behind pokey traffic. I managed to fade them pretty badly coming down Old Priests Grade. I now use low range on the CVT if descending such a long steep hill, especially behind traffic. Honda should fix these two issues right away as they are safety issues.  I have three other suggestions for improvement that would be easy in a mid-cycle update of the 10th generation Civic: 1. Volume knob (clearly you know this as the new CR-V has one), 2. Add more padding to the seats, and extra $.58 of foam would help tremendously. At the front edge of the hood is a small narrow extension of the hood above the grill. This separate piece hurts the clean lines of the front of the car, just extend the hood and make it work (I could do it, I know you can too), The extra small features catch the nap of the wash mitt I use every time I clean my car and it's annoying.",4
1367, on 03/30/17 15:26 PM (PDT),BryG ,2016 Honda Civic  EX w/Honda Sensing 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Great Car but....," So I went with the EX 2.0 sensing. Part of the reason was the 16in rim size allows for a little more tire which provides a softer ride especially on awful NY roads. This is my third Civic after an 09 and 14. It rides better and quieter than both. Unless you are comparing it to a Buick, I'd say it rides great and is comfortable for its class. The 2 liter has good power but almost has that laggy feeling sometimes making me wish I went with the turbo.  I'm not a huge fan of the CVT but it works leaps and bounds better of the old 5 speed automatics. Normally I go with the manual but you can't get the EX Sensing in manual and I wanted to try that tech out. The adaptive cruise control is awesome! I'm always behind drivers that can't decide how fast they want to go and adaptive cruise takes care of that. The lane keep assist is very cool and works best on state highways or Interstates as long as the lines are fairly visible. And its just awesome watching the car steer it self, keep a finger on the wheel and your pretty much good to go. It will get mad if you let go of the wheel for a few seconds. Very roomy interior, I'm 6'1 and its fine and I can sit behind my normal driver position fairly comfortable as well. The gauges are awesome. The overall layout makes you feel like you're in a more expensive car.       Now for the bad, the stereo! The connectivity to my Iphone almost always needs to be redone in some way, unplugging and plugging back in, it will just switch sources on me like from Pandora to Apple Music usually right when I get out of the driveway. Maybe Bluetooth will connect, maybe It wont? And lately the screen has been turning off on me for a few seconds here and there. Sound  quality is ok at best. They should really offer a stereo upgrade for all trim levels like to a JBL or something as It is not east to upgrade modern car stereos yourself. So I give the stereo situation an F, it fails big time. Being someone who likes music, that is enough for me to start looking at other brands. That being said, I do enjoy the car very much. I lease, and can say Honda has had great Leases so far, saving you thousands of dollars especially if you are a new every 3 person it is the only way to go.",4

Dealership service wasn't prepared to do the repair and spend days talking to Honda Tech Support. Collectively spent near a month with a loaner.  Service department sent me home without completing routine maintenance twice stating the car didn't need to be serviced even though the service warnings were present. Overall this is an experience I hope to lay to rest very soon. Hopefully this dump car with hold it's value when I'm trying to trade it in.,1

Had them all   from Accords, Civics, and even a 4-wheel steering Prelude...(sweet).  This is definitely the Honda of old.  Great driving, great gas mileage, and just plain fun to take a long road trip in.  The Touring model has great tech for a car of its price.  My only issue is with the subwoofer.  It did rattle, but doesn't take much to realize you need to have sound proof the brake light in back window better.  That is where the rattle come from.  5 minutes and $2 later....no rattle.  The touchscreen can be slow to respond and go into stupid mode but seriously its a computer....reboot it and its fine.  You have won me back Honda....congrats on a great little car.",5

Out of the past 80+ days, my car has been in the shop 50 of those days. My bluetooth does not work, my infotainment screen goes in and out, the emergency breaking goes off randomly, etc. I have 29 issues all together with my new car. The first 2 Honda dealerships told me they have seen these issues before and did not want to get wrapped up in legal issues so they would not try and repair my car. Honda corporate will not even talk to me about taking my car back and have been completely disrespectful. Honda truly is NOT the company they used to be and I WILL NEVER buy another Honda again.

I am 5'4"" and if I position my driver seat to comfort my driving. I can not comfortably fit in the backseat. The cup holders are small, although there is a larger one underneath there is only one, that is usable only if the smaller tray is removed. The compartments in the door can not hold even a water bottle. The USB connection underneath the radio is apparently not compatible with (HTC, Galaxy, IPhone), although it worked fine for the first month! The other USB port is a 1.5 port and it takes a lengthy period of time to charge 'anything'. The stereo has been beeping and switching screens since two months after I purchased it (bought in April 2016). Between two dealerships here was an update done on the stereo and low and behold....same problem. The dashboard houses a loading circle everyday which prohibits me from seeing the speed and every other feature of the the dash screen. HONDA CORP AND THE DEALERS HAVE DONE NOTHING AND NOW I FIND MYSELF IN A LAWSUIT TO REPLACE A STEREO.***UPDATE: As of July 2017 my stereo's parts have finally, finally been replaced. I have waited over a year and half to have this fixed which is scream for help as far as Honda standing by their product. Furthermore, I have been having trouble as an expecting mom with the height of vehicle (sits too low), and the room in the vehicle is barely sufficient to hold an infant car seat and use the front seat properly. a reduction of the trunk to add more space to the cabin would be a PLUS!!!",3
1373, on 02/10/17 14:02 PM (PST),David W. ,2016 Honda Civic  EX w/Honda Sensing 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Quality Control Lacking, Never buy a first year model is something you hear a lot but never expect to have to worry about with a Honda. However the car looked good upon delivery and I was happy to drive home w apple car play duel climate zones and a sunroof! Not to mention the thought of saving at the pump w good mpg's. Maybe I should have looked at the car more closely but with a new car you don't expect to have to go over the car with a magnifying glass or the white glove treatment esp. w a Honda...I pull in the garage with my new car and discover the front bumper is not lined up on the driver side it is poorly placed and I don't think should have passed inspecting in the factory but it did! also the chrome trim is made up of 3 pieces above the front grille and 2 of the 3 were not on correctly either. The radio also froze on me once. The good is that the dealer fixed or seemed to fix the radio and chrome trim. After 4 trips for the front bumper and having to call customer service and the dealer would not willingly give me a loaner car they only made that problem worse chipping the seemingly thin paint. This was a brand new car w 5 miles on it when I drove it. It also developed a window rattle or some rattle around the car that was never investigated as I decided to return the car for an Accord...problem solved? No because the Accord was also new in dark blue gray trim and I was happy until at home again I found missing paint on the car it was down to bare metal on the A pillar w no paint no rust just silver metal no under coating etc. a poor paint job which had blemishes and other imperfections on the hood and various places. I think drive the car around town and with only 200 miles the cars air bag lights go off and according to the owners manual mean no airbags are working now and I should not drive the car....I called Honda who towed the car to the dealer and exchanged it for now my 3rd car all of these were new. So far almost 4k miles on it and no issues other than the black roof trim that runs along the roof is coming up slightly on the passenger side and the glove box does not appear to be completely lined up correctly basically bad panel gap from the great and mighty Honda. Quality control seems to be lacking at the moment and I don't plan on buying another Honda however they did give me a 500.00 gift card for my troubles from corp. the dealership was not very helpful in actually being able to fix the issues I just had to argue for a 3rd car in a matter of weeks and sell the civic back at a loss. The Accord was just exchanged as they hadn't even processed the paperwork for the blue one due to it being on a weekend lucky me and discovering all of its issues with in a matter of days!,2

The three main reasons were, previous experience with Honda product, Honda service experience, and I liked the new model.  The four star rating I gave it was because the fifth star is earned threw the test of time.  If it does as well as my other Honda products, it will earn one more star.  Update. Great gas mileage (35.2 combined). Quieter than previous Civic but still highway speeds a little loud. You seam to sit lower in the cockpit than previous model which is good for taller driver. My wife and I are shorter drivers so I wish both front seats could be adjusted higher. You can det used to it but it would be on my wishlist. Update 8-5-18. Car still preforms great.

I can't say enough good things about this car and it's hard to criticize much of anything.  The good.  Honda hit a home run IMO when it comes to styling, comfort, and just being a darn fun car to drive.  Oh.  It's cheap too.  Fuel economy is through the roof.  The CVT is just fine, it shifts the car better than you can.  Acceleration is more than pleasant, bordering on giggly fun.  If you want brutal you're gonna have to go buy a Charger Hellcat or similar.  Don't expect a Civic to compete with that.  My gripes are few.  Two to be exact.  Visibility out the rear window could be a little better (but it's still not too bad) and the GUI for the touch screen radio .... interface .... thing was apparently designed by an engineer and not a normal, ya know, person.

1386, on 12/18/16 11:57 AM (PST),Kaitlin Conley ,2016 Honda Civic  EX-T 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),I LOVE my car," This lucky girl was given my new Honda Civic EX-T by my fabulous husband. I have always been a fan of everything Honda. My first car was a 2009 Honda Civic and I loved it, but the switch to this new car has been breathe taking. First off, I love the little turbo in my car. The first time I drove it the torque actually caught me off guard. I always kind of believed that Honda civics were reliable, yet gutless little cars, but with this new car that is not the case. Next, everything about this car is beautiful. The interior seat material is nice and does not look cheap. Everything about the inside of this car feels luxury. Now, yesterday was the first day that I was truly able to test how my car would do in the snow. It had snowed before sun down and then froze over as it was about 18 degrees at night. Needless to say, my car did fantastic! I did not slide once, mind you, I am a pretty cautious driver in the snow, but in comparison to other front wheel drive vehiclesi have driven in the snow, this car did so great, which is a major perk for me with the crazy Utah weather I have to deal with. The only downfalls I have had with this car are the climate control and the touch screen steep system. My climate control has had issues cooling when I am idling, and not just a small amount. When I took it in to see what was wrong, when the dealer tested it, it was blowing 80 degree air when I had it set to the coolest setting. It would blow cold and hot on and off. They ordered my parts but I have yet to hear another word from the dealer, I'm sure though, aside from whatever is wrong specifically with my car, the climate control would be great. As for the touch screen stereo, it can be a little slow and has some glitches here and there but nothing that bothers me too much. Overall, I am so in love with this car. There are so many perks to this car that I use for my 40 mile daily commute.",5
1387, on 12/17/16 12:25 PM (PST),David Burke ,2016 Honda Civic  LX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Nice for what it is," Some of the reviewers here think they should be getting Lexus quality in this car, but that's not going to happen.  I owned a 2009 Civic Sedan and a 2013 Elantra sedan before buying this one so I am able to compare pretty well.  First and foremost for me is the cabin noise because that's where they really got better over the other two, with the 2009 Civic being really noisy and this one very quiet for a small car.  Ride is second because this is much smoother than either.  Cabin noise, ride and handling make this car feel like it should be much more expensive, and this handles like a dream for the price.  I was really wow'd when I first got behind the wheel and it is a pleasure to drive.  The seats could be better & more comfortable but overall the quality of the interior is much nicer than the other two.  What I think is that this car is a really good value and I am quite happy with it so far.  ****Update: I've now owned the car for 7 months and took one long trip in it and my feelings for the car have only gotten better.  Driving the car for 3 hours was a pleasure and going 80 in it feels like you are driving 50 and it passes quite well for a 4 cylinder.",5

1389, on 12/10/16 18:57 PM (PST),Coinneach Fitzpatrick ,2016 Honda Civic  EX-T 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),"Best bang for the buck, period"," I've put 1400 miles on my EX-T in 2.5 weeks of ownership and have pretty thoroughly shaken it down. This is my first CVT car; I was expecting a slightly more refined version of the terrible Altima transmission, but instead, I'm very impressed. It's unobtrusive, responsive and smooth. The 1.5L turbo isn't nearly as laggy as everyone claims, and considering it's Honda's first attempt at a turbo, it does a fantastic job. My first tank scored a 50/50 (45 mph average speed) combined economy of 37 mpg while still being a blast to drive. The steering is slightly heavy (it's a Honda, this is how they roll) but precise; it does seem to fall toward the down slope of the road crown a little more than it should, which I believe is caused by the frankly low-end Firestones. The brakes are solid and ABS works perfectly. The seats are very firm and supportive, but the extremely tight weave of the fabric means they tend to heat up quickly; the automagic AC takes care of that problem. I've had back-seat passengers bonk their heads on the very low, sloping entrance, which is just a limitation of the fastback design. The Display Audio system is buggy, probably because it's simply a tablet based on Android KitKat; however, the GM MyLink in my previous two cars was just as bad. The controls and instrumentation are very clear and logical; the windows and moonroof seal impeccably; the build quality is phenomenal (more than once I've heard ""This is a *Civic?!*"") and it just flat looks badass. tl;dr: Honda knocked it out of the park with the 10th Gen Civic.",5
1390, on 12/08/16 22:02 PM (PST),Josh ,2016 Honda Civic  EX-T 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),This one is a keeper!," I've had my 2016 civic EX-T for about 2 months now and haven't had a single regret about my purchase! I traded in a 2014 accord coupe that I never could make myself like. The new civic is so good! It's comfortable, quiet, roomy, and has plenty of power. It just hit 4,000 miles and I love it more every time I get in it. The cvt transmission is great, my accord had it so I was already use to it when I bought this car. I will never go back to a traditional automatic because the cvt is just sooo smooth. My mom has a 2017 accord v6 with the 6-speed auto and every time I drive it I think something is wrong with it because it's always shifting! You get so much bang for your buck with the civic. Push button start, rear and side cameras, automatic lights, large LCD screen for the tach/speedometer with many different settings, LED running lights, LED tail lights and tag lights, remote start, etc. It drives like a much more expensive car and handles the road so well. I love this car and I see myself keeping it for many years to come!",5
1391, on 12/07/16 07:17 AM (PST),ztimulating ,2016 Honda Civic  EX w/Honda Sensing 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl CVT),This car is fantastic," Bought this for the kids because it has automatic braking and my short offspring liked the visibility.  A lot of folks think kids should drive old cars because mistakes are less costly.  As a 20 year insurance professional I know protecting my children's lives is more important so finding a car with auto brake lead me here.  The car has a top IIHS rating (NHTS star rating is worthless in my opinion) but in addition to being safe this thing is great to drive.  My daily driver is a sports car and I am very happy jumping into the Civic with half the horsepower because the chassis is fantastic, it makes the whole driving experience nice.  This is our first CVT transmission, Honda really dialed it in and it does not distract from the experience.  The control layout is great, apple and android car play is fantastic, this $20K car has better nav then my spouses $45K factory nav.  Took a while to get used to the lack of radio volume knob but that is so minor.  The servicing dealer are a bunch of jerks, actually charged us for an oil change for a factory recall regarding the piston not being attached correctly.  called the service department manager and he immediately agreed to remove the charge but the guy who added it wouldn't remove it over the phone so we had to go back - which was the last time ever at that dealership.Update 6/2017. Car is still fantastic.  The only small complaint is a torn rear seat after kid dragged viola case over it.  I'll take safety and reliability over interior materials so its Saul Goodman.",5

Never had too many problems with the others so I decide on the 2016 Civic for my newest car purchase. It's a great car, as long as you don't care to know how much gas you have. With only 1100 miles on it, the gas gauge stop working. Well, not entirely. It has a bug where it only won't work in the morning. If you drive it around, turn the car off, and then turn it back on, it will work. But its a brand new car; I shouldn't have to do that. I took it back to the purchase dealer and they said there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. Took it to a second dealer (now at 1600 miles) and they currently have it in the shop and are keeping it overnight. I'm very very disappointed in Honda and in my purchase of this vehicle. Who knows what will go wrong next? Think long and hard before purchasing this vehicle as the quality of Honda has gone significantly downhill.",1

This car had 7 miles purchased 4 days ago.  On the way home from dealer I noticed it made vibrations after 1 hour on the road in the Arizona heat.  Vibration and rattles from dash and from exhaust area.  When I would travel 50 mph and take my foot off gas, car decelerates to 30 mph is when the rattling from exhaust occurred.  Also rattling from engine and dash.   This is an issue as web sites and YouTube has documented owners having similar issues.",4
1415, on 09/13/18 12:34 PM (PDT),Bill Danner ,2018 Honda Accord  Sport 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Sporty look and handeling, I have always looked for a manual transmission when looking for a new car. I was surprised to see the Accord sedan sport 6 speed manual and was intrigued. After checking the price and limited availability I almost backed out of new in favor of used. I was trading a 2013 LX-S manual and the 2018 was the only option to move in to a newer model. Prior to the 2013 I had a 2009 civic manual with great pickup but small interior. I traded up to the 2013 Accord for more room but found that it had less zip than the Civic due to the increased weight. The same was true with the 2018 as the size increased the 1.5 lt engine is a little sluggish during acceleration. My wife also noticed this on her first outing. I guess the higher price for the 2.0 lt engine is warranted in this case. I am happy with the trade off between price and performance and the car is still fun to drive with plenty of interior room.,4
1416, on 09/12/18 16:12 PM (PDT),Greywolf ,2018 Honda Accord  EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Is this an Acura?," I can't say enough good things about the handling, supple ride and performance on this EX-L. I really can't imagine a luxury car giving one much more in comfort. My only complaint is that Honda has eliminated some of the tech onour 2016 EX-L in order to keep costs of all that safety equipment from taking the car up over the $30K mark. The simplified dash is just adequate. What happened to the always present compass? What happened to that great right side camera? The blind spot warning on the left was a needed addition and those TWO video screens were a joke (needless redundancy) but Honda needs to start updating ALL lighting to LED, not just on the Touring model. The low beam LEDs are great, but WHY old-tech, yellow halogens for the high beams??? Makes no sense except Honda needed something to justify the $2,000 difference in trim levels. Cheap marketing tricks. Same with the exhaust ports. A turbo engine with two INVISIBLE downward exhausts???? C'mon, Honda, catch up with the rest of the pack with these features. But all-in-all, a wonderful car for the money. I traded a 2016 Civic Touring for this Accord and couldn't be happier.",5
1417, on 09/11/18 10:35 AM (PDT),M Witte ,2018 Honda Accord  Sport 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo 6M),A pretty little car but...," So I picked up my Accord back in late March of this year for 27K. I have the sport model with the 18"" tires and a manual transmission which I appreciate since so many American cars don't come with a stick except at the higher end models. The car handles well, and overall I'm satisfied with it considering my job has my driving around 2000 miles a month.  HOWEVER, as with any car there have been a couple issues. The touch screen is finicky and likes to freeze up when using Apple Car Play, you also have to connect it to the lightning port to use it which for some reason doesn't charge it while doing so. Additionally, make sure you check everything is installed correctly before driving off. I had a mirror come off in the car wash and even though their's no damage to the side mirror assembly, the mirror itself isn't covered under warranty because of ""outside influences."" as per the dealer and Honda of America.",3

Took 2 Honda Field Reps to Correct the issue 5 days after driving it off the lot. Also the car has a bad vibration feeling in the drivers and passengers seat between 45 and 65 miles an hour. Honda says it’s normal due to the 19” 40 low profile tires. BS...Won’t even esacalte my request to repair or replace the car at Honda Corporate now going on 15 days to get someone from Honda corporate to call me back.

I am a busy mom and I love the acceleration and smooth ride.  Beautiful colors to choose from as well.  Quality is there.  The only thing I would suggest, Honda, is to update better sound system, however that doesn't bother me too much.  Other than that everything seems to be perfect.  I'm driving the LX model and that's Honda's 'base model'.  It is still quality with the alloy wheels, nice comfy seats, technology, lane assistant, huge trunk space, and back up camera to name a few.  My kids are very very tall, and can get in and out with no problems.   The ride is comfortable and smooth.

The car is very attractive and appealing to others who see me driving it.  I find myself driving it much more than I did my 2015 Accord and ease of parking is very manageable.  I receive less dings and dents on this car (I've only had one ding) compared to the daily or monthly dings and dents I received on the other car.  The vehicle goes longer between maintenance (which is a saving) and all of the incentives that Honda offers makes it more affordable.  My first Honda Accord was a 2002 in which I drove it for 13yrs. and enjoyed the dependability it offered.  My only drawback is that my 2018 Accord did not come with a CD Player and I have not yet figured out how to play my music through the cell phone.  I am sure that when I take it back to the dealership that they will show me what I need to do to get it to work.  Overall, it is a great car, fun to drive and driving it makes me feel good about my ownership of this vehicle.",5

I found that the 1.5 with the CVT transmission was more responsive with plenty of get-up-and-go and excellent mileage.,5
1425, on 08/27/18 18:19 PM (PDT),Royo1212 ,2018 Honda Accord  Sport 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Just under 2k miles," This is my second Accord and 4th Honda. Pros of this car: The Apple/Android car play are easy to use, the steering wheel controls are smartly placed and easy to command, and the digital display options on dash can be switch to many different options. The gas mileage has been 26.9 around town and 32 combined, it is easy to drive and the air conditioning gets cold fairly quickly in 90+ weather. The wheels and tires provide smooth and stable ride and look nice and there is a lot of interior room in front and back seat.  Going from the Accord V6 to the 1.5L turbo has not been an issue. This car has plenty of power and sport mode makes it fun to drive. Brake hold is a nice feature to have while driving in city traffic. Overall I am pleased with the purchase and the purchase price. The cons: The seat materials seem cheap to the touch and the synthetic material tends to show snags easily due to being nylon type material. My kids already made a water stain on the back seat from a water bottle that leaked. I am 5’6” and have never felt I sat too low in a Honda but feel I sit low in the car which makes visibility more difficult. You step slightly up and out of the car rather than just straight across like the 2006 Accord. Older Hondas are much more easy to drive and you felt more in control of the car since visibility was so easy. This new Accord has the feel that reminds me of a Ford or Chevy where the hood is visible from driver seat, which is new to Hondas.  Unfortunately, due to being able to see the hood the car feels wider, which was one of the new features. The brake and gas pedal are also farther apart than the old Hondas. I do not like the placement and often find myself pressing on the bottom quarter of the gas pedal. I am still having to adjust to the new look and drivability of the new Hondas.",4

Wife drives Acura, I drive Honda and my Prized old Jeeps,  anyways I've always appreciated Honda styling, reliability and the sleeping "" power"" the endin Amazing 3.5 V6 had. The pickup in my 2018 touring 2.0 ""turbo"" is nothing less than upsetting.  A real let down kick in the crotch to loyal Honda buyers like myself.  The 3.5 offered killer gas mileage, better 0-60 times by mind blowing difference and getting 200k was simply a warm up.  My wife noticed the odd decisions 2 model years ago in her Acuras that upset her which was fake leather and duel exhaust missing, the dealer who adores her couldn't apologize more but said Honda/Acura was going the more millennial eco friendly route wherever l whatever that meant,  but sadly what it means to us is changing brands after nearly 20 loyal years. Your supposed to progress, not regress like Honda/Acura is doing. I'm giving you my checkbook, you give me what I want, very simple.  This 2018 is an utter failure.

Cosmetically, it is one of the coolest designs I've seen in a long time. It no longer looks like a family sedan, but the sporty race car you really want to own, only with four doors. The only negative I have to say about this vehicle is the A/C. When outside temperatures go into the 90s, it takes a LONG time for this car's cabin to cool down. My commute is about 30 minutes, and the car finally cools down about 15 minutes in. But, thankfully, that is only on really hot days.

1443, on 07/30/18 12:59 PM (PDT),WalterDLC ,2018 Honda Accord  LX 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Noise Everywhere," My wife and I bought both 2018 Camry SE and Accord LX and this is how I can confidently write this review well. Both have good designs but both interiors are way different. The Accord’s driver seat is manual.  Even my old 12 Camry LE (the lowest variant) has a power driver seat.  Anyway,  the interior design of the Accord is awkward in terms of the comfort.  The cabin’s middle storage bin is placed low for both driver and passenger’s elbow to rest on.  The Camry’s is placed exactly elbow level and aligned to the transmission shifter.  The Accord’s cabin noise level is bad. You hear the road, the tires and worst, the cars around in the freeway making you fear of getting crashed.  The dash and under the seat makes an annoying buzzing vibrating noise when I accelerate but never on humps/bumps and rough patches of road.  I am guessing it might the nylon or plastic black ribbed wiring hose that may be loose and making a grinding noise as well.  The rear seat is comfortable but the road noise and the shakes feel like rear cabin of a compact.   On the exterior, Honda seems cheap by simply installing a hood stick rather than gas-filled hood cylinders.  Again, even my 12 Camry LE has those cylinders on both sides of the hood making it easy to lift up.",3

Read manual twice while sitting in car. Plan on going back to dealer with a list of questions you have after a few days of driving your new car.  If you are moving up in years from 2013 or before, welcome to the world of new car technology! The 2018 Honda has more features than you will probably use. But, the safety driving features could be a life saver eg, blind spot warning &alarm alone is a great feature! Was going BMW 330 route. Have to say with Honda’s new design handling is superb.

1445, on 07/27/18 09:26 AM (PDT),BL Sieler ,2018 Honda Accord  Sport 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Really Good Car," Traded in my 2015 Subaru Legacy for a Honda Accord Sport 1.5L CVT thanks mostly to standard Honda Sensing. Was going to trade my Legacy--a highly underrated car--for a new one with Eyesight. After finding the Subaru dealers in town difficult to work with I stumbled on to the new 2018 Accord and I've been very happy with it so far. The ride is very good, could use a little less engine/transmission noise. I won't be drag racing with this car but the acceleration is more than enough to make an aggressive merge onto the busy freeway. Android Auto is a nice plus. As for the Honda Sensing, the Adaptive Cruise Control works quite well in 20-65 mpg traffic, not as good in stop and go traffic as the car sometimes takes too long to get going after stops. Also I find the lane keep assist too aggressive but you can turn this off if you prefer. I do like the forward collision mitigation--it works without being overly aggressive. Fuel mileage has steadily improved to around 30 mpg in mixed driving. Interior is roomy though leather/cloth combo seats not as comfy as the cloth seats in the Legacy. Exterior and interior styling are what attracted me to the car, The Sport wheels are among the best you see on any car. My only real complaint about the car is the size of the fuel tank (14.8 US gal). 14.8 is small to begin with then fuel gauge only allows you to use 12.5 gallons before reading 0 miles til empty. For some reason Honda's are all engineered to have a real life fuel range of 350 miles are so. I could go nearly 500 miles per tank on my Legacy with the 18.5 gallon tank. Even though I'm getting better mileage with the Honda, I'm not sure why Honda thinks people want to visit the gas station more often. Seems unnecessary. Overall I enjoy driving my Honda--and also looking at it--and give it an overall score 4.5 out of 5 stars.",5

1448, on 07/25/18 09:24 AM (PDT),Brandy D ,2018 Honda Accord  Touring 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),AC DEFECT...MOLD!," Hello, I purchased the 2018 Black Honda Accord Sport on Jan, 5th 2018. I dove it off the lot with only 2 miles. The car is beautiful and I get a lot of compliments on it. I noticed around May of 2018 I started to smell an odor, I ask my husband if he could smell it and he said ""no. I went to Yankee candle and purchased some air vent air freshener, thinking it would get rid on the smell. My husband never drives the car it's primarily me and my 5 year old daughter that is in the car on a daily basis. After months of driving the car on a daily basis, I guess my nose gets use to the smell because I can no longer  smell the odor that I use to smell. Months later my husband took the car to have it cleaned up and he noticed the under the passenger seat on the back seat floor  was wet. He ask if our daughter had spilled anything  and I told him no , because I don't let her eat in the car. Days has went by and the floor mats are still wet. I pick up a friend from work and I ask her, ""What does it smell like in this car? She replied "" Uh like mold or  mildew. I then said ""Ok I know I wasn't crazy, I having been smelling something for the last 3 months. The next day I took it back to Crest Honda dealer ship where I purchased the vehicle. They check and said that the carpet was wet so water is leaking from some where. Once the techs check it out, I was told that the AC hose was pointing up and not down so the water from the AC was draining into the car under the passenger side!. So it was likely a manufacturer error. WOW... what a health hazard for my daughter and I. I was told that they would pull up the carpet and replace it and treat the car for Mold! I am so mad that I don't even know what to do. Has anyone else had this problem?",4
1449, on 07/24/18 06:37 AM (PDT),Allen B ,2018 Honda Accord  Sport 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 10A),I hated Honda's until.....," First let me start by explaining my title. My first car was a 92 Accord Ex.  I hated it.  It was slow, boring, and the green color my mother originally loved when she bought it new before it became mine I hated.  This started my lifetime of hate for Honda's. Over the years I have watched as Honda has created cars that look amazing. Mainly starting with the 17 CR-V.  My wife actually owned a 17 model and again, I loved the tech but felt a vehicle this size, why no V6 or a larger 4 cylinder with a turbo.  The time came to upgrade from my 08 BMW 5 series a couple of months ago and I made a trip to the dealership we bought the cr-V.  There it was. The black 18 Accord sport 2.0T.  I had just watched a video two nights prior singing this cars praises.  I was there getting my wife's CR-V a free oil change and next thing I know I had to get her uber'd over to pick up her car because I was signing papers on the very car I spotted.  The car drove like no Honda I had ever rode in.  Even trumping the speed and handling I felt when driving my friends TLX. (Yep Honda still makes acuras for some reason less the NSX). The handling was not the exact greatness of my previous BMW, but it was much better than 4 other cars I had test driven that week.  When I tell you I love everything about this car with the exception of two complaints.  I am 6'3 and for a car that is so long it is a shame my right knee often scrubs the push button start area that protudes down from the front dash and often I feel a little crammed in, but I have adjusted the seat to where it is not so bad now.  2nd qualm, please Honda, stop cheaping out on your sound systems.  I test drove a touring as well and the system can get loud but just sounds so horrible. I chose the sport due to the looks and rims knowing the system was worst then the touring but still the top of the line sound system is horrible.  Honda get with some company and collab on a good system, even if it is kicker or Alpine just do it please.  I digress, outside of those two qualms, this car is amazing.  The handling, acceleration, comfort, space, and reliability (to be seen with this new turbo 4 banger love Honda has moved into) of a Honda have changed my hate to love.  The 1.5 is adequate but i promise the 2.0t will make you smile when you slam the pedal to the floor.",5
1450, on 07/19/18 13:21 PM (PDT),Bill ,2018 Honda Accord  LX 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),My new 2018 Accord, This new Accord has a lot more zip than my older 1992 Accord.,5
1451, on 07/17/18 13:03 PM (PDT),Kenny ,2018 Honda Accord  Touring 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 10A),Fun good looking car!," Decent incentives right now, we were able to get ~$3k off MSRP.  Love all of the technology built into this car.  However, the biggest selling point for our family of four was interior room.  I did months of research on the new Accord and nothing in this class really comes close.  We downsized from a Honda Pilot so we were concerned about leg room and the loss of utility that came with having a SUV.  While I do miss the auto opening and closing hatch on the Pilot, the roominess and overall comfortable feeling in the interior works very well for us.  Almost seems like we have more interior room.  I am 6'4"" and can put the drivers seat all the way back and my 5' tall daughter still has plenty of leg/knee room.  Love Love Love the 10 speed auto and 2.0 turbo.  Never owned an Accord before so I can't compare my 2.0T to the previous V6 models.  However, the transmissions works quickly and smooth and the car is much quicker than I expected it to be.   My only complaint, and it is a small one, is I wish on the Touring trim Honda would have added the USB ports in the back console for the rear passengers.  You can buy it as a add on at the time of purchase but it is not cheap to have it installed, so we opted not to do it.  Should just be included.  I am also scared to death of damaging these massive and beautiful 19"" rims.  I hope they hold up to these Ohio winters.",5
1452, on 07/16/18 10:28 AM (PDT),tray ,2018 Honda Accord  Sport 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Get the 2.0 turbo exl but stay away from the 1.5," Updated 8/24/18 review- (I've now traded the 1.5 2018 accord turbo as of 8/14/18 for a new 2018 2.0 exl Honda accord)After just 816 miles I just traded the Honda accord  2018 1.5 liter sport for a 2018 Honda accord for a 2018 2.0 turbo accord exl (non sport model). First let me start off by saying the driving experience is 1000% more pleasant & enjoyable in the 2.0 turbo. The reason being the 2.0 exl comes standard with a normal transmission which by the way is a 10 speed auto transmission. The prior model that I had was a 1.5 sport 2018 model which had a cvt which made me wont to drive the car off a cliff because of the loud continuous whining from the cvt. I wouldn't recommend the loud 1.5 turbo for anyone unless you're a person that drives slow and likes to hear a car that sounds like it has a broken transmission. I must admit that the 1.5 liter sport was more appealing with the big black 19 inch rims from the exterior, however the ride quality and the loudness of the interior noise especially at highway speeds was totally unacceptable to me. The Good news is the new 2018 2.0 exl WITHOUT the sport packet has a very luxurious ride, and is quiet as a luxury vehicle. I literally barely feel any bumps AT ALL! Also the exl 2.0 comes standard with the power moon roof, and the keyless hands free door locks and unlock. The old 2018 1.5 sport required me to pull out the keyless remote to unlock or lock the doors or truck which became very annoying especially considering the fact that the 1.5 sport model had a push button start.  Now back to the new model 2.0 exl the best thing other than the beautiful interior, comfortable leather seats, and power moon roof would be the VERY strong and powerful yet fuel efficient 2.0 turbo. I've had several people who have rode in both the old 2018 1.5 turbo and now the 2.0 and each person seems to comment  that it literally feels like they're in an entirely different car. Everyone seems to notice just how hard the 2.0 pulls especially from a stop light, and how quiet and smooth the 2.0 is compared to the old 1.5 accord. One of the craziest things that the gas mileage for me is actually better in the 2.0 than in the 1.5,  maybe it has something to do with the car not having to strain so hard . So if you are planning on buying an accord test drive the 1.5 then test drive the 2.0 and I can guarantee you will not mind spending the extra money to get the 2.0 exl. STAY AWAY from all of the sport models unless you would like a rough ride, excessive highway noise, and enjoy frequent tire replacements. The standard 17 inch Michelin exl wheels are cheaper to replace, will have more grip, and will last longer, and will be noticeably smoother and quieter.  So after putting 468 miles on the new 2.0 version accord I'm now totally satisfied and changing my review rating to a 5 star. =============================================7/16/18 old review of 2018 1.5 liter turbo( this car has now been traded thankfully)The 2018 Honda accord sport comes with lots of standard technology. I came from a 2016 Volkswagen Passat which has 184 ft lbs. torque . The Honda on paper has more power and torque compared to the Volkswagen 1.8 liter Passat. The Honda has 192 ft-lbs of both torque and horsepower, however it feels extremely sluggish compared to the turbo Passat. In fact you cannot even feel that there is a standard turbo on this car.  The cvt is loud when you step hard on the accelerator, and it totally robs the power from the accord. Also there is an abundance of head room for tall six footers like myself. The car seat very low to the ground so older people may find it difficult to get in and out of the vehicle. My biggest complaint with this car would just how loud the Goodyear tires are on the highway. I’ve owned several vehicles , from Nissan, Toyota, ford, and i can say this is the most loudest sounding vehicle that I’ve ever owned. Honda needs to add sound deadening materials to its interiors to help cut down on the sound. The next biggest complaint is the fuel economy. This car is only averaging around 21 miles per gallon in mixed driving on the 2018 sport model. I also own a 2016 kia cadenza which has a very strong reliable v6 and gets better fuel economy then this 4 cylinder turbo Honda. The only way a person is going to get good mileage is to drive long distances on the highway or drive like a 100 year old senior citizen on the road. The exterior is very sporty and sleek. My model came with the black sports wheels and I constantly get compliments daily on how nice the black on black accord looks. Since purchasing the vehicle I’ve changed out the factory radio since the Honda sport doesn’t come with HD radio which means you are going to get a ton of static on some radio stations. Also I changed out the speaks which just sucked . Before you buy this car drive it on the freeway to determine if you can bear the loud tires, cvt noise.",5

1454, on 07/10/18 16:34 PM (PDT),Jason C ,2018 Honda Accord  Touring 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 10A),Amazing car for the price w/ some issues," I am thoroughly enjoying my 2018 Accord 2.0T Touring and it hits every mark save for a few quality issues. Performance, economy, and its technology are second to none for the price. Styling and some apparent first year production quality issues are however a small concern. The adaptive cruise control w/ auto lane keep assist are like a less smart version of Tesla's auto pilot but make highway commutes in stop and go traffic a relaxing experience. The car almost drives it self and I am just there to to supervise. The auto lane keep assist is also super helpful in crazy L.A. traffic since it keeps you in the lane through all sorts of twists and turns and auto cruise control with auto braking, heads up display alerts and audible alerts ensure you don't run into the car ahead of you.  The infotainment system w/ Apple care play and Android auto are also a necessity now, but keep in mind the Android auto is far more feature rich when used with this care. With android the  heads up display and instrument cluster will provide navigation tips w/ google maps while the Apple equivlent does not. I believe this is probably because the care uses and Android based infotainment system and or Apple is simply behind the curve in feature integration. I have had some minor quality issues. In super twisty roads with extreme elevation changes the auto high beams and adaptive cruise control will freak out. Auto high beams however can be disabled for manual operation. I have had one situation where Adaptive Cruize control faulted and stopped working until a restart of the car, but otherwise it has been mostly trouble free with some odd quirks which I hope will be ironed out with future version updates. Some minor external and internal body panel misalignment's have are apparent, but no deal breaker for me.",4
1455, on 07/10/18 13:31 PM (PDT),Michael ,2018 Honda Accord  Touring 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Luxury car for great price with FLAWS," Overall, the car is loaded with features and value.. from the led lights, Apple car play, navigation,heated front and rear seats, hud display, auto dimming mirror, homelink, adaptive dampers, etc.. its a great value and cvt transmission is very smooth. the 1.5 turbo is the way to go in my mind especially if you do a good amount of city driving. Plenty quick. The vehicle does sit low but thats to be expected especially coming from an SUV as i have. The 19 inch tires with Michelin look great. And are actually somewhat smooth and quiet for being so big. Side and front profile of car is where car shines in my mind. Rear is average to below average. I'm adding rear deck spoiler which I think improves appearance a lot from rear. Seats are super comfortable. Almost 40 mpg on highway. Real city mpg is around 24ish. Now for my issues which are unnacceptable in my mind when buyin a car with an msrp of 35k. The heads up display makes noise during the day im assuming from the sun heating it up.. Almost like styrophom rubbing together. It comes and goes but needs to be fixed asap. The dealership told me the engineers are working on permanent fix and to be patient. Also, rear deck noise from PREMIUM sound system.. that is insane to label a sound system premium and have the rear deck rattle during any song with real bass. Again, another issue the dealership kinda brushed off. Overall, honda made a value packed great car with quite a few fatal flaws. The issues I mentioned can not exist in a brand new car. This is not what new car buyers buy new cars. We expect them to be perfect when brand new. Otherwise, we would buy a 5000 used car and save boatloads of money.. my previous 3 cars were Toyota and Lexus and never had an issue like this.. and while toyotas can get boring to drive, there is a lot of value in their quality and lack of issues.  I always considered honda and Toyota to be tied for the best.. not anymore. Very disappointed in honda. And the dealership. However, I'll make another post about that",4
1456, on 07/08/18 07:25 AM (PDT),Scott ,2018 Honda Accord  Sport 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Feel like a kid again with the manual transmission," Leased a 2018 Sport Manual with the 1.5 engine. Perhaps it was dumb as I'm 40 yrs old with a family, but the manual brings the fun back to driving again. Overall a great car! The 1.5 turbo has plenty of power, allowing me to chirp the tires in hard shifts into 2nd gear. However, truly amazing to me is that it is returning 34.8 mpg in real world driving. This is a mix of 75city/25hwy. I'm quite impressed by the gas mileage as I have driven the car fairly hard in my first 1,000 miles and used 87 octane. The good: strong engine (1.5), gear box, handling, tech. Google car play is an amazing interface that is very easy to use. There is very little I don't like about the car. Some minor gripes: on the highway, the road noise is a bit loud, but I came from a Lexus. Certain roads seem to catch the tires jerking the steering wheel ever so slightly. Not sure if it is the tires or the steering. And one really annoying gripe, there is no trunk release located on the trunk. You either need to use the keyless fob or open from the driver side door. This is the one thing I hate - so I suppose if that is my biggest gripe, then the car is solid. If you like a smooth manual transmission, with plenty of power, that is fun to drive, go get one! Mine is the red color and I've had a lot of people come ask what it is. When I say an Accord, they shake their heads in disbelief. Very nicely done Honda!",5

I commute home from north of Boston to southern NH in some of the worst traffic in the world; and yet driving this car makes it so much it almost fun.  I love watching the technology in action.  I put the adaptive cruise control on (which also includes the low-speed crawl feature - awesome) along with the Lane Keep Assist and the car basically drives itself home with me virtually never touching the gas or brake pedals until it’s my turn to take an exit, and even then the car can exit and come to a complete stop all on it’s own (assuming there is a car in front of me doing the same thing of course).  Watching the morons who spent way too much on lux brands white-knuckle it home in the fast lane while hammering throttle and brake almost simultaneously as if it makes a material difference on their commute time has never been more enjoyable.  I love owning such a fine piece of engineering that speaks volumes on the value and quality front, and still leaves plenty of room to fund the kids’ 529’s and max the 401ks.

Audi, BMW, Lexus, Toyota, Mazda, Nissa, Hyundai, you name it. After months of researching and test driving, I purchased a 2018 Accord Touring. Let’s talk about asthetics: The Platinum White with the black tires, badging, and underbody spoiler gives this car an aggressive look that turns a lot of heads. The look of the new model has really grown on me. At first, I didn’t know what to think, but it’s kind of like a new album from a band you love that has a different sound...sometimes you just have to listen to it for awhile before you can fully appreciate it. Getting into your Accord feels like getting into a spaceship. The back seats can fit your friend who is 6’4” no problem. The interior is well-designed and beautiful to look at. It is simple and elegant. The full digital readout and infotainment screen greet you when you turn on the vehicle - and I know you’re thinking the engine can’t sound good because it’s a 4 cylinder, but you’re wrong. There is a throaty growl when you turn on the car and even more so when you are in sport mode and testing the acceleration. The 10speed automatic shifts like a a dream and there are not many cars (if any) in the sedan class that can beat this Accord off the line. The heads up display and adaptive cruise control make driving less work - and the car can almost steer itself if you turn on the lane keep control. I bought this car with all the bells and whistles - if you could add it on, I did. Door sill illumination, puddle lights, spoilers, etc. All things that are completely unnecessary and this reflected in the bottom line I paid. However, I’m 29, so having a car that you could easily put a family in is important to me, but when I’m driving by myself I want something fun and sporty to drive. I have about 1,000 miles into it at this point. I’m sure that some bugs/issues will come up at some point, but knowing Honda we will get them resolved. I highly reccomend this vehicle. The combination of comfort, speed, practicality, gas mileage, and beauty should put this car high on your list.",5

1463, on 06/18/18 11:42 AM (PDT),Kevin B. ,2018 Honda Accord  Touring 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 10A),"Great Vehicle, but....."," I've had the car for 3 months and put 3k miles on it.  I have the 2.0 Touring with the turbo.  Overall, I'm very pleased with it, but there are a few quirks I don't like.  I've discovered that it is difficult/impossible to determine how close you are to a parking curb or sidewalk on the front end.  You can't gauge where your front end is by looking out the windshield and over the hood.  The car has sensors that detect objects to the right or left, but none that tell you how close a concrete bumper/sidewalk is to the front bumper.  The front bumper sits fairly low to the ground which means it's threatened every time you try to park.  Why not put a sensor to protect the middle of the bumper?  To compound the problem, if you are on any kind of an incline, up or down, the gear shift becomes problematic.  Let's say your bumper is two inches from a concrete bumper and you're on a slight decline.  When you put the gear shift into reverse, the car will drift forward up to 6 inches before reverse actually catches hold.  Result?  Your front bumper gets scraped.  I've never had a car before that has so much drift when changing gears.  Another problem pertains to the wheels.  I believe my wheels are 20"".  There is very little distance between the rim and the ground as the tires provide only about a 2"" buffer.  This becomes a problem when you get near a curb as there is very little protection for the rim.  As a consequence, if you scrape a curb the rim takes the impact, not the tire.  This really makes a mess of your beautiful rims.  Check it out when you're in a parking lot: Honda rims will be much more scuffed than others.  OK, all that said, I'm still glad I own the vehicle and am very pleased with the quality, performance and mileage.  (I recently drove it from PHX to LA and got 36 mpg at 75 mph.)  Would I buy it again?  You bet.  Do I hope they make some improvements before I buy my next one?  You bet!",4

I was most excited about the new REAL transmission - I am not a fan of CVTs.  But the new transmission is not at all smooth!  From the first moment on the way out of the dealer lot to the road for the test drive, the transmission was misbehaving by jerking and ""stumbling""...it felt like it didn't know what to do.  After getting out on the road, things didn't get better, the acceleration was not smooth and there seemed to be a long lag before it sped up - it was not a pleasant driving experience at all.  On the way back into the lot to park it, when I let off the gas, the transmission ""stumbled"" badly as it felt like it was shifting down through all ten gears quickly...not good.  The car handles well and has a quiet ride but it does not feel spacious inside because you are sitting so low and seemed like there were a lot of blind spots.  Maybe the car I drove had not been broken in or something was wrong with it, but I urge you to pay close attention to the behavior of the transmission if you test one of these....also, I noticed that the cover over the camera on the windshield that is part of the Honda Sensing system was broken or had come loose - fit and finish issues?

I test drove the Rogue and CRV. They were nice but did not give me a feeling of excitement. I test drove the Accord not expecting to like the low seating position but to my surprise I loved it! For a 1.5 turbo it has great acceleration  and feels very classy. The doors have a solid quality sound when you close them.  I have received many compliments on this car. I have only put 600 miles on it but have no complaints. Averaging 33.8 on the gas mileage. Overall very happy and would recommend.,5

I shopped around for a couple weeks, and drove several competitors including the Camry, Malibu, Maxima, Legacy, Optima, and Sonata.  Decided to go with the Accord because I had a 2014 and loved it.  It was the most well built car I've owned.  No rattles, ran great, no issues.  The 2018 Accord rides great, looks great, and has all the technology I want.  The unfortunate part, is the fit/finish is poor on the inside.  There is a HORRIBLE rattle in the heads up display area and also on the back deck under the back windshield.  The dealer is aware of these issues as is Honda Of America, but I've taken my car in 4 times now to try and get this issue resolved.  Hopefully they get it fixed, but there are a lot of touring owners having the exact same issue.  Which begs to question, why didn't this come up with Honda when testing the car?    What will go wrong next?  I hate to say it, but I'm likely going to trade this one in for something else.   I hope they get these issues resolved, but it's been a big inconvenience and kept me from enjoying an otherwise good car.",3

Honda lost it's styling mojo, did you used up all your styling brain-cells on the 2017? the front of the 2018 is hideous  and looks unfinished, and from the side, it gives the appearance of an older model Chevrolet Malibu, Sure the turbo engines give greater torque at the lower engine speeds, this gives you a little quicker from stand-still acceleration, but why not give the customers an option to purchase the V6?  Walmart grew to one of the largest companies in the world by listening to it's customers, prior to the supercenters, Walmart gave out surveys and asked their customers, How can we make your buying experience more enjoyable? Customers replied, A place to shop 24/7, Get my car repaired, while I purchase groceries and getting my nails done, and Walmart delivered,  and became one of the most powerful global companies in the world,   To be honest, I can't see the great features for staring at the appearance of the car, since this is my review, Honda, the redesigned Accord get a failing grade, appearance isn't everything but close and the sales numbers speak for themselves",3

It is much quieter, we got all of the upgrades available and the technology is remarkable. Too many cool features to list. We have driven it 800 miles so far and it handles like a dream, it almost drive it self on the expressways. It steering is remarkably responsive and it handle corners much better than the 2012 version. We are very happy with our purchase. Our 2012 model has 60K on it and all we have done is change the oil, filters and put a set of Pirellis on her a year ago- which really lessened the road noise and improve the handling. My wife calls the new one the bat mobile. It is black with the larger low profile tires, the tinting and the moon roof and its cool lines- look it up and I think you will agree.

I priced the 2018 Honda Accords and the features were not as sporty as the newly designed 2018 Camry.    The Camry has,  like a Honda Accord,  a great reliability track record and are similar in many ways. I'm a creature of habit, owning 5 Camry's in the past,  and decided to buy another Camry.   I know I'll be in that car for many years to come and excited about the many safety features the new Camry has included in the price.     My car insurance rates were a little lower because of the safety features.   If the car drifts into another lane,  the car monitor will beep and the the car gets back into its lane automatically.    If I get too close to the car in front of me,  the monitor will flash BRAKE and the car will automatically stop to avoid a collision.    The ride is smoother than my trade in 2016 Camry LE.

I read a review before I bought by car and the review stated that the GPS was a joke the materials in the interior were cheap and the engiine was a little noisy. They were right.  I have always been a fan of Toyota but i am turning away unless they can do something about this gps system.

1494, on 08/29/18 14:16 PM (PDT),ROMIL ,2018 Toyota Camry  XSE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 8A),Toyota Left Out Some Key Features Competitors Have," I was comparison shopping between this car and a 2018 Honda Accord. I test drove the Camry SE and XSE (both 2.5Ls) and an Accord Touring (1.5T). I ended up choosing the Accord, the reasoning to follow. I slightly prefer the exterior of the Camry to the Accord, especially the rear, but up front the Accord looks better. Toyota's gaping maw of a grill is a bit off-putting. The Accord drives better. I have only driven the Accord with the 1.5T/CVT combo, but even with a CVT, the transmission is much better than the ZF 8-speed in the Camry which is incredibly jerky, especially at low speed. You'll notice a lot of other reviewers also hate on the 8-speed. The Accord's CVT is probably the best CVT on the market and is very smooth with good acceleration. The Accord also has adaptive dampers (in Touring trims), which the Camry does not. When you push the Sport mode button in the Accord it actually signficantly changes the driving dynamics. You can feel the car tighten the suspension and steering and the transmission changes its character to be more aggressive. I also prefer the design of the Accord's interior. It isn't quite as flashy as the Camry's but it is significantly more ergonomic and user-friendly (other than terrible cupholders). The Accord is one of the few Honda vehicles to feature Honda's redesigned infotainment system, which is quite good and a million times better than the joke Entune system in the Camry. The Accord also has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which the Camry doesn't. The Accord has a couple other features the Camry doesn't have (at any price point, even though the Camry costs almost $2K more that the Accord at the top end): memory seats, ventilated seats, and over-the-air software updates via Wi-Fi. The omission of the first two is absolutely unbelievable to me. Almost every competitor has ventilated/memory seats in the top trim levels and for less money than the Camry. I have heard Toyota wants to ""reserve"" those features for the Avalon, which is super-lame, because, like I said, competitors have them. In its defense, the Camry does have a 360 degree camera system and a panoramic sunroof, which the Accord does not have, but for me personnally, the memory/ventilated seats are far more important than those features. The visibility out of both cars is great, so the 360 degree camera is a bit unnecessary. The pano sunroof seems nice, but I never use my sunroof. If you read any direct comparisons between these two cars by professional auto reviewers, every last one of them has given the Accord the victory over the Camry. Also, looking at owner reviews on this website, the Accord is crushing the Camry in owner satisfaction. Toyota did a nice job with this revamp, but the Accord is still a better overall vehicle and has been for decades. Some will argue that Toyota sells more Camrys than Honda does Accords every year. True, however, a significant portion of Camry sales are fleet sales to rental car companies. Removing that from the equation, they are fairly equal in sales each year. One last point: I see a lot more old Accords on the road than I do old Camrys. They are both reliable, but the Accord being a better-driving car all these years is more likely to remain with an owner for a long time.",3

1496, on 08/26/18 19:08 PM (PDT),SJSandy ,2018 Toyota Camry  SE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 8A),User error/petty betty's," In true millennial style I always read reviews before buying... for everything. From shampoo to HVAC units, I read reviews and then read some more.  Car buying was no different. I test drove several other cars in the mid size class... honda, kia, nissan, hyundai to name a few. The 2018 Camry outdid them all. Because of this I couldn't wrap my head around all of the negative reviews. While I do read reviews I don't necessarily always take them for the gospel and Toyota's reputation proceeds itself... so I went with it. I've honestly never been more pleased with a decision. Other reviews mention negative thoughts on the entertainment suite, gears not switching smoothly, lane departure steering assist, head light brightness... I've never had an issue with the entertainment suite and I use it everyday. I have to imagine that like a lot of things with technology these days, it often isn't the technology but a user error. The ride is very smooth and I haven't noticed any difference between 6 gears and 8 gears. If anything it's a more seamless progression. I haven't felt like I should be in a different gear once. The lane departure steering assist is a huge asset and straightens me back up in my lane each time. The adaptive cruise control is also a super useful feature. Gas mileage is out of this world. I drive roughly 80 miles round trip 5 days a week with a pretty equal balance of city and highway driving and I'm averaging 37+mpg. The headlights are not too bright, they're perfect and I haven't been bright lighted once. There is one teeny tiny negative I will note, there is a small piece of the dash on the passenger side that somewhat interferes with the passenger's ride if they are very tall (6'5""+) but no issue if they are the driver. I have to imagine that many of you negative reviewers are extremely petty people that are a nightmare to interact with and probably nitpick everything to death. Don't take it out on the Camry, folks. To the buyer that'son the fence, buy the car--it's awesome and you won'tbe won't disappointed. I've never had a bad experience at a Toyota dealership either. The warranties and maintenance plans are great add ons as well.",5

1501, on 08/16/18 12:43 PM (PDT),B Mill ,2018 Toyota Camry  XSE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 8A),Regret," I leased a 2018 Camry XSE (4cyl) in December of 2017. Within a week I held great regret about my decision to go with this car, brand, and dealership (2nd car from them). During the final inspection of the car, I noticed the large plastic divider between the two panes of glass on the panoramic sunroof had fallen down. The dealership immediately fixed it, which was greatly appreciated. Everything else seemed to be perfect. Within an hour of leaving he dealership, the divider had fallen again. It being late in the evening, I called the dealership the next day and had to take the car in a few days later to have it repaired. This has continued on now over 5 visits to the dealership for this specific issue. Each time they simply clip it back in place, and it falls down within minutes of leaving the dealership. Getting the car in the winter allowed me to experience another fun flaw in the car- when the temperature is low (I'd say under 50), the speakers in both front doors rattle to the point of nearly driving me insane. The dealership has denied they do this when the car is sitting still in the heated dealer maintenance shop (which is true). The moment you drive the car however, which the dealership does not do, the rattle, which can be easily heard over even the loudest music, commences. Other issues have included: metal door edge guards pulling away from the car/rattling, back seat seat belt alarms going off randomly, grinding noises from the automatic parking break (have not had addressed yet by the dealer). Total I have visited the dealer around 12 times, and have taken off work for about 3 total days having work done on this vehicle. Toyota corporate's response is simply that the vehicle is under warranty, so keep having it repaired. My lease is for 3 years, and the warranty only lasts 2. I am greatly expecting heavy service bills when that warranty is up as these issues just keep occurring with no end in sight. On my last visit, after many employees telling me how odd these issues would be for such a great car, a service employee mentioned that all the problems I've had have been experienced by others, and I quote ""Toyota just rolled these things out too fast"". This car has made me long for another brand, and feel regret about having even gone near the 2018 Camry XSE.  I should note: the car is very comfortable on long rides, and the engine seems to work well. (Credit where credit is due)",2

Keeping three apps always open on your phone to run the navigation system does not work. You still have to search by typing the address into the car unit.

1506, on 07/27/18 11:56 AM (PDT),Brian ,2018 Toyota Camry  XLE 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Not Recommended," Purchased a 2018 Camry XLE V6 pretty much fully loaded.  Because of two significant items I would not purchase the vehicle again and don’t recommend it.  First, the drive train is unacceptable.  This is the forth Toyota vehicle I have had with the V6 engine, and the only vehicle in which the transmission both up and down shifts can be uneven and jarring.  At times when the vehicle accelerates slowly by the driver gently depressing the gas pedal there is a noticeable pulsing of the vehicle acceleration.  Doesn’t matter what mode the transmission is in.Second, the Radar Speed Control is poorly implemented.   If a leading vehicle turns off the road to the right the Radar Speed Control drops out and the vehicle brakes.  This is a serious safety concern with the possibility of being rear-ended when there are following vehicles.   Also, when using the Radar Speed Control and approaching stopped vehicles the Camry will continue at constant speed or accelerate until the only recourse is emergency braking.This disappointing, because I otherwise really like the vehicle.  It’s comfortable, has good performance and handling, I like the panoramic sunroof, it has a good sound system, I appreciate the automatic high-beam system, and I like the touch screen.Other less desirable items:This Lane Departure Control is marginally useful.   When the vehicle drifts toward a lane stripe the system does not alert the driver until the vehicle is significantly over the lane line and into the adjacent lane.  If corrective action is taken by the system the vehicle swings from one side of the lane to the other side of the lane and never centers in the lane.  Better than nothing, but …After remotely starting the Camry engine and then opening the car door, while in possession of the fob, the engine shuts off.  If someone has the fob then they can do whatever they want – so why shut off the engine?We have many streets with a 25 MPH speed limit, but the Radar Speed Control will not set that low.The touch screen has a Valet mode to protect the screen and sound system and the glove-box can be locked and the key removed from the fob.  But there is no way to lock the trunk and prevent entry when the Camry is given up for valet parking.  (I believe previous Camrys had a trunk lock feature to disable opening the trunk with the fob?)Most items in today’s vehicle are software controlled.  Toyota should provide software fixes for the transmission, the Radar Speed Control, lane departure, and remote starting.  A minor hardware and software change to the trunk lock could probably fix the trunk valet issue.",2
1507, on 07/26/18 09:46 AM (PDT),Andrew ,2018 Toyota Camry  LE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 8A),Learning the transmission, Bought April 1918 the Rudy flare 4 cyl ie model with the convenience . After few days the transmission was not very smooth. The gears were dancing around and down shifts were long. Went to dealer had 5k tire rotation and I notice they put 36 psi and also talk to tech about the tranny and was told I need to get used to the tranny and very gear was like a sensor and I needed to know how to adjust. Well I notice a big difference in the car and I believe that extra air in the tires really helped and started to listen to the car and started by not apply a hard pedal and going with the flow of the gears. I was going to dump this car in the beginning now it is fun to drive.,4

It is exceptionally painful to set up all of the accounts and linkages, and then have to use Scout GPS which I cannot say is bad, only that the stars have never aligned well enough to get the GPS on the screen in the Camry.  You also have to have it plugged in to use it, defeating the purpose of the built-in wireless charging.  I do not regret buying the car; however, it is regretful that in Toyota's arrogance they think they have created something better than just turning the system over to CarPlay.  What they have done is create a cumbersome customer experience.  All it would take is some software re-write by Toyota to enable CarPlay.  PLEASE DO SO.",5

Tremendous headlights, good handling and mpg, plus it's quite comfortable.  BUT little things Toyota missed, or didn't care about, drive me nuts on this car. You cannot roll down the back windows at over 25 mph or your ears will be pulsated to oblivion (well that's not a little thing). Plus the back windows wind down at warp speed so cracking a window for the dog is basically distracted driving. There's a release clip in the trunk that won't stay in place, the front bumper cover is held in place with FRAIL, cheap plastic clips,  (as in UNBELIEVABLY cheap, my toaster's crumb tray is held on better) and replacement is $$$$$$$. One of my clips is cracked from scraping on a parking space marker at maybe one mph (seriously). and the dealership basically blew me off wouldn't even attempting to reattach it. Sent me to a body shop. The four cylinder engine is NOISY and shifts are rough at times, the tranny sounds like it has 200K miles on it. Except the headlights and the safety stuff, my 1999 Camry was a FAR better built car.  Wow, I am Mr. Buyer's Remorse. I hate to take a beating but I am already looking to get out of this car at 7.500 miles. Sad. Don't even get me started on the COMPLETELY useless navigation system. I even called and sat in my driveway for 20 minutes while a tech reinstalled it, a complete waste of time. The entire Toyota Entune system is garbage, a complete shock from Toyota.",2

Front doors sound extremely cheap and hollow when closing. My XSE has a loose roof, noticed day two of ownership. Told it’s needs complete roof. Parts alone close to $4k. Really poor and customer service is not up to par. When they contact you they leave instructions to call back. Not possible and make tons on excuses. Car looks great, has exact fuel economy as listed, rides and handles well. Oh last thing. Never lift the driver side wiper to clean or remove snow or such. It hits the edge of the hood and damaged the paint. You can’t lift the wipers. What idiot approved that design.  Really questioning this purchase.",2

1515, on 07/08/18 20:17 PM (PDT),Mary ,2018 Toyota Camry  LE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 8A),Great gas mileage and good safety features," This is our 3rd Camry since  the mid-1990's.  Our first on gave us good service until we replaced it due to high mileage (180,000+ miles) and age in 2011. We have the 2018, because the 2011 was in a major accident (highly applaud design that crunched the whole front end but left the car from the dash back in mint condition).  We have been impressed with the 2018's improved gas mileage and safety features of blind spot monitoring, back up camera, rear cross traffic and perhaps the most helpful on a recent long car trip has been the cruise control that adjusts itself to maintain a safe following distance from cars in front of you.  As with most of the 2018's we test drove, this car's biggest negative is the front seats.  Both my husband and I need to use extra cushions to make it possible to drive the cars without experiencing back pain.  (We have no health issues and are reasonably fit and attempt to use good posture as much as possible.  At least for us, it's the design of the seats that seems to be the issue. ) We have not used the scout navigation or any of the other entune services and don't plan to so, I can't comment on them.",4

I cannot believe there was no CD player! I would never buy another Camry again if they do not have cd players. I currently have a 2014 Camry XLE with a cd player and navigation and really like it. I see the 2018 as a huge downgrade from my 2014. In addition to the lack of a cd player the leather seats are very disappointing. The 2014 has nice soft real leather,the 2018 seats feel like cheap plastic. The 2014 navigation system is easy to use, the 2018 has to be paired with some stupid phone app. I do not understand how Toyota has fallen so far so fast. I would NEVER EVER buy a car without a cd player. I just read that the Altima has cd player in all its 2018 models. I guess its goodbye Toyota for me after 20 years of owning Toyotas!",2
1521, on 06/27/18 15:26 PM (PDT),B Madison ,2018 Toyota Camry  LE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 8A),Abnormal Throttle Response," The 4-cylinder in the 2018 Camry accelerates adequately, but there is a noticeable irregularity to the throttle response.  To me the accelerator feel is very non-linear.  If you need to accelerate lightly and press the right pedal down a minimal amount (maybe 20 percent) there is almost no engine response.  However if you are not careful to continue pressing gently once you reach a certain throttle position the engine over responds and either revs too much and/or inadvertently downshifts a gear or two when you don't want it to.  This is disappointing because drive-by-wire technology has been used in many mainstream vehicles for 15+ years now.  Perhaps a software update could address this.  Interestingly I drove a 2016 Camry rental a couple years back and did not notice this issue.  I am hoping this is corrected for the 2019 model year or this may be a deal breaker for me.",4

1523, on 06/25/18 07:32 AM (PDT),Tim-A ,2018 Toyota Camry  SE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 8A),"Gained looks, lost brains"," My gf and I rented an SE in Atl for 4 days. Here are some pros and cons of this vehicle. To start, it's a sharp looking car; aggressive lines, low, and large wheels make this stand out. Further, the handling is not your typical Camry as they changed the rear suspension to double wishbone. It handles like an older E60 5 series; very well planted but supple on the highway. Speaking of highway, the mpg is ridiculous. At 75mpg I was averaging 42 to the gallon. Over the course of our trip we drove around 100 miles. To refill before returning cost me a whopping $9. Impressive. The Cons are big however. The transmission needs an office space printer style beating. The 8 speed hunts for gears like an old basset hound whose lost her smell. There's a sport mode with paddle shifters, but they may as well have been developed by Fisher Price. A long 1 second pause between shifts happens before the tranny decides to act. Especially from a dead stop, the delay is maddening. My gf's head was constantly hitting the back of the headrest from the jerkiness. If your in sport mode and you don't pull the paddle, it goes into auto immediately. Moreover, the engine is chintzy and harsh. It whines when pushed above 3k. The entertainment system left a lot to be desired as well. Developed in house, its touch interface was slow and the layout was wonky. So in summary, the new 2018 Camry is kinda like the old Pontiac Fiero. Great looks but underpowered, a terrible transmission (the same shared with the new Tacomas that drivers also hate), and cheap tech on the inside. Stay far away from this one for now.",3

1534, on 05/31/18 04:11 AM (PDT),Ashley ,2018 Toyota Camry  XSE 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Regret came after 1st maintenance," I fell in love with the body of the car, but the primary reason of purchase was the great financing Toyota offered me. It was a no brainer so I purchased the 2018 Camry XSE V6 back in Jan. I drove the car mainly in eco mode, but every now and then, when I felt like having a lil fun, Id put it in sport and barely  give it a little gas and it had amazing torque. I recently took the car in for the 1st maintenance and everything changed after that! I can no longer drive the car in eco, unless Im in traffic and don't need to drive past 20 mph. Normal mode now feels like how the old eco drove and sport mode is a complete joke. It has ZERO torque now. I took the car back and talked to 3 different supervisors who looked at me like I was crazy saying all we did was do a tire rotation and top off your fluids. I had their lead tech drive my car who did not notice anything and ""ran some tests"". He came back and said nothing is showing up and there is nothing wrong with your car. I told the supervisor to have his tech drive a new car and then drive mine again. He did and still did not admit to any difference. When he stepped on gas in sport mode with the new car, I pointed out to him thats the torque that my car now lacks. In the end, he concluded it was the gasoline I was using...I use the same gas from the same station for years so this was highly unlikely to be the issue in my mind. So far, I have went through 2 more tanks of gas and still no improvements, that very clearly is not the issue here. I am furious that I had zero issues with acceleration before taking it to Toyota and am now left with a slow car that does not change gears properly. I hear the torque but don't feel it, I have even floored it and it did nothing!  The other issue I have is seatbelt in the back, when the arm rest goes down in the back, it throws off the seatbelt sensors and everyone in the car has to unbuckle and re buckle to turn the alarm off. I am very dissapointed since this is the first car I have ever purchased and I will never buy a Toyota ever again!",2
1535, on 05/27/18 18:02 PM (PDT),Doug W ,2018 Toyota Camry  XLE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 8A),"XLE Black Leather dry dusty look, poor Lumbar adju"," 2018 XLE Camry Ruby Red, Black Leather. $28,077.13  out the door price. I rate the 2018 Camry engine noise/engine sound some where between a Flivver and a Chitty-Chitry-Bang-Bang.  You can see the hood quivering at stop signs while at idle.  I am satisfied with the power and acceleration of the car despite the noise. Transmission could be smoother, but is quiet and can not be heard, maybe because of engine and uncalled for road noise. The exterior metal is thin. Looking down the sides of the car you can see the metal change/ripples as it approaches the seems/joints.  Shutting the Camry’s drivers side door you can see the panel vibrate/flex and I was worried about cracks forming in the paint, but the Toyota Service department told be it was thin for milage and the paint would be OK.  And it does get good Milage in the central Florida area.  driving in the Tampa Bay area I get about 33 mpg verified by calculations from the Optometer and the gas pump.  And have gotten 42 mpg driving to St. Augustine including the drive through the Orlando area. If you like technology, you will NOT be very happy about the Entune system.  I knew the Scout GPS was unreliable from all the reports I read before buying the car, so I bought a GPS with a bean bag that sits in the hole in front of the shifter and below the dash board.  I haven’t even tried the Scout connected system, in fact I do not want to connect my iPhone usb to the Entune system. I do use the Blue tooth for Phone and Text using the Siri part of Entune.  Phone seems to work all the time, text most of the time.  I did find 3 apps that work marginally most the time with the Entune - They are Weather, Yelp, and Gas Prices. The Entune sound quality NOT impressive.  The sound quality is somewhat better when you play Mp3s on a usb thumb drive, poor sound quality by blue tooth off the iPhone. (same music files on both) The Car will drop the grace note art when you put the Camry in gear, making you read text instead of briefly glancing at the Grace note icon.  It may be an attempt to let you try out the collision Prevention system instead of looking at the road.  Along with the numerous warning boxes that pop up on the screen, anything from ”you will be using your phone data plan” - to - “ when Safe and Legal to do so….” this Entune system is Toyotas attempt to maim and kill by distraction.  Entune, controls do NOT function when the car is moving. Car parked: finding a folder, Album, Song no problem.  Once the car is moving,  pushing any of the screen buttons will take you to folder 1, track 1 on the usb thumb drive. The dealer upgraded the system but problem remains, finding a song, artist, or folder by voice is probably at best 50% effective. (even after doing the voice recognition)  The automatic high beams works perfect.  The “Auto” headlight setting and headlight controls are not up to the technology available.  All sorts of alarms when headlights are on and engine off, other systems shut the lights off. Fortunately they let you turn the day running lights off on settings. The running lights, turn signals, and headlights are tacked on like they bought them at different times from e bay.  The lighting scheme on the front of the car are disjointed and just plain ugly. Gigantic grey plastic grill with no option of fog lights, just a clump of unrelated lights stuck on each side above the grill. The Cruise controls works great with the exception it accelerates to fast when the only car in front leaves your lane -It makes you look like a jerk when there is someone signaling they want to enter your lane and and the Camry is nose up in acceleration, otherwise, when it has a preceding car radar locked onto it behaves well with cars entering/leaving your lane.  On occasion the blind spot warning indicates ghost cars in the lane to the left. There are NO cars, but the light will come on, and sometimes stay on for miles. The dealer could not find any problems. Lane Keep Assist (LKA)- Florida lane makings are very thick layers of paint, sometimes with embedded rumble strips on them.  The Lane Keep Assist will alarm at the same moment the tires are rumbling on the lane divider .  This means the door panels, mirrors, etc. are well into the next lane, then the steering assist kicks in and oversteers putting the car on a quick trip across and into the opposite lane.  I keep this off most of the time unless on wide interstate lanes - I don’t want to be surprised.  The dealer could not find anything wrong with this or the settings either.  LKA seems to be more of a cheap gimmick than a safety feature.  I wonder how this is different that the advertised “keeps car centered in lane” as offered by other makers. fic. use it frequently, wish it would stay on after restarting the car.    When I bought the car I put the car transmission button in the “Eco” mode, then wondered why the car A/C could not handle the Florida heat, noted that the system would not automatically turn on the A/C...",3

Overall, I'm quite happy with it. The main areas of improvement are the fuel economy and ride quality. It's much more composed over small bumps. The headlights are also much brighter (LEDs are great), and the adaptive cruise control is actually useful. Weak points to me are the transmission and infotainment system. The car is very sluggish to take off from stopped. After it gets going, downshifts are much better and acceleration is good. But it feels like there is a delay between pressing the gas and getting the car moving. Infotainment is incredibly weak, and this will be the reason Honda surpasses Toyota in sales. The apps are literally useless. Entune is floundering. The GPS feels like it's from 2006, and none of the other apps are anything I want to use.

The transmission is responsive is sport mode but hunts for the right gear on occasion in the other modes.  The car is responsive to steering inputs, stable on the road and corners well (for a sedan). The only problem I have is that the bright metal on the dash reflects into the side window on both sides of the car making the blind spot warning hard to see at times.  You would think the designers would have caught that and put a matte finish on the bright chrome (plastic, I think). I traded in my Genesis Rspec coupe and thought I would really miss it (I loved that car), but I don't.  We are enjoying the spaciousness, the attractive styling, and the new safety features.

It took me about 3 months before I bought it, because I wanted to make sure I was making a good purchase.I paid a great price for my car and I find the car very good. It is very gas efficient, has many safety items, but there is something that is bothering me so much, that is the transmission. The gear changes are slow and accelerating the Camry soon after a slowing down is a terrible experience. The transmission is always hesitating to change gears. I complained about this problem with the Toyota Dealer and was given the ""wonderful solution"" to avoid using the ECO mode and always use the SPORT mode. I confess I was surprised that the solution given by the Toyota Dealer because I believe that Toyota Engineers are a little smarter and able to design a better transmission that my car has.I have prayed a lot for Toyota engineers to find a solution to this problem, otherwise I'll have to change my Camry for an Accord.",4

Did the team that installed this system even test it out? They could not have! I have been lost at least a half dozen times in the three weeks I have owned this car. It just cuts out anywhere and everywhere. Antennae is probably defective and since it runs on cell phone, the signal is sometimes cut off. PLUS it uses my Iphone 8 battery at an alarming rate with the entune, remote and Scout apps. I HATE IT!!  Had I known this was the Navigation I would not have bought the car., I have owned four other Camry XLE and LOVED the navi system. Now I am angry and frustrated.

After having it for few weeks I started hearing a popping sound in my roof especially when driving in rough roads and I had to deal with the dealership for few months until they figure it out what's causing the issue, sounds disappeared for a while after service and came back after few weeks, had another service schedule on May 19. Technology on this car is a joke, why can't you have the SCOUT GPS work thru Bluetooth? instead you have to connect your USB and oftentimes interfere with other apps. Acceleration is sometimes jerky, when at full stop, press gas pedal gently otherwise you'll have a jumpy shift change.",3

1550, on 05/04/18 17:22 PM (PDT),Gary ,2018 Toyota Camry  LE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 8A),Nice car but," Getting ready to replace my leased 2016 Camry SE Special Edition with 4cyl auto. I drove the Camry LE 4cyl with 8 speed auto. While the ride is comfortable and quiet, the shifting and drive ability of the 8 speed transmission is not to my liking. The acceleration is fine, but cruising on the highway seems dead with throttle response slow unless you mash it to the floor. I reset the MPG display to zero and the car did obtain 31mpg. However, on the same highway, at the same speed, my 2016 gets 42mpg. Also the throttle response is far superior on my 2016. Further, the Entune radio system is terrible. On my 2016, the Scout GPS could not be made to work and it is still the same on the 2018 I tested. My 2016 Camry is the very best car that I've ever had in over 50 years of driving. However, although the 2018 is a nice car overall, I won't be getting one. I like it, but I don't love it.UPDATE 5/18/18I test drove an LE 4cyl and reviewed it here. I was somewhat critical of the 8 speed transmission and gas mileage. I was replacing my 2016 Camry SE and in the review said that I liked the 2016 better. However, after driving/pricing much of the competition, I just couldn't pull the trigger on any of them. So, I decided to take another look at the 2018 Camry. This time I drove the SE version with 4 cyl. I took it for a very long test drive on the interstate as well as in the town where I live. After that drive, I concluded that I was too hasty in my evaluation/review and that my objections about the transmission being sluggish, was more of my getting used to the 8 speed over my old 6 speed. In this test drive, I found that driving the 8 speed wasn't as objectionable as I previously thought. Yes, on the highway it did downshift frequently when going up an incline, but that's what transmissions are supposed to do to keep up the car's speed. I also found that in town it shifted out of 1 fairly quickly. To me, after driving for an extended time, it wasn't bothersome at all. I was also critical of the gas mileage in my original review and said that although it did meet the EPA estimates, my 2016 obtained higher mpg. Well, I was wrong and must have not cleared out the old mpg information as I thought I did. This time, I found that the car averaged as high as 49 mpg on LEVEL interstate @ 70mph. Of course that dropped when I started to encounter hilly sections of highway. So far, the indicator shows an average of 32.2 mpg overall with my city driving included. So, yes I decided to get the 2018 SE and so far have not been disappointed. I've noticed complaints about noisy engines, uncomfortable seats, poor interior materials, etc. In my case, I have not experienced those issues. So, what is my recommendation? Take a longer test drive under the conditions you normally experience.",5

I decided to star reading reviews about it and then make the desicion well the simple fact that the car doesn't support Android auto and it has too many complains about that stupid Entune and scout GPS kept me away to pulled the trigger on it so I said myself what the hell I'd go and test drive it  so I went like the car and everything beautiful car I told the sales guy if he'd let me pair my phone  to see how the Entune works so he couldn't do it and told me a bunch of excuses why it didn't work anyway long history short I didn't buy the car instead I bought a Honda accord sport 2.0t love it the best desicion ever, support Android auto , Pandora,  everything , love the power the style everything , being a Toyota guy my advice is this. Toyota thinks they can survive just with his brand name but it is a lot of competition Kia Optima SXL is very very nice , Honda accord , sonata limited, all of them smoke Toyota on technology,  so I can't justify pay 35k dollars for a car that just has radio and you have to give up all your data on your phone just to just  a GPS that doesn't work  before you make a desicion do your homework , watch YouTube videos , read what the real people has to say about the car , don't go by what the deer say, ask question on forums etc, too many ways to prevent waste 35k dollars and get stock with a car that you will hate every time you turn the radio... remember we expend most of our time in the car buy something that support everything you need and put a smile on your face when you drive it.. the accord did it to me..",2

This Honda Civic has the easiest steering and handling of all the cars I test drove. For those who have weak arms or are suffering from some sort of disability with their arms, I highly recommend driving the Civic. After my accident, I've had trouble turning my steering wheel (especially when trying to turn left or make a u-turn), but not with this car! It feels like my arm was never broken when I drive behind this thing. It has a great turn radius as well.  The gas is pretty alright on this car - takes me about 1-1.5 weeks before I have to refill my tank - mainly because I live in California and that traffic is just terrible on the MPG. If you like listening to music (especially music with a lot of bass), it's better to go with the Touring. Unfortunately, I didn't (I went with the EX-L), so my sound system isn't all that great. My 2010 Nissan Altima had a MUCH MUCH MUCH better stereo system (Bose), so it was a joy riding that car. My altima also had very very little cabin noise. The new Honda Civic has a bit more cabin noise, which I'm personally not a fan of. I prefer it to be quiet (aside from my music). For a second to top tier trim level, I was pretty disappointed that it lacked some of the qualities my altima has even though my altima was just a second trim with a convenience package (altima 2.5s). Otherwise, great car. So far, works the way it is expected to.",4

1558, on 08/28/18 11:14 AM (PDT),Justin ,2018 Honda Civic  Sport Touring 4dr Hatchback (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Fun Sporty and Safe, This is an amazing car especially for its class. The 1.5 turbo has tons of power and still has super good fuel economy. It's not sports car fast but for everyday drivability it feels a lot faster than it is and always has quick pickup with the low end torque. The top end power you do notice it starts to die out compared to actual performance cars but it is way faster than anything else in its class. The sport touring does recommend Premium fuel though but you can use regular. I always use premium though. The car also handles great and drives smooth. The hatchback is very useful and you can fit a lot of stuff in it when you fold the rear seats down. All the cabin materials in the sport touring trim are top notch soft touch. There is no hard plastics or cheap materials. The stock sounds systems with the sub also sounds very good. The Honda lane watch is one of my favorite features and provides a lot of safety especially in rush hour and makes switching multiple lanes of traffic a breeze. The adaptive cruise control also works great but is a little sensitive where it slows down and leaves too much space between cars for my liking but it is safe. It can also pretty much drive itself on the highway with the adaptive cruise control and follows the lane markings and even steers. If you let go of the steering wheel though it will give a warning and tell you to hold it. The automatic breaking works great. The car is also extremely safe. I owned a 2016 Honda civic and was t-boned by a pickup truck going over 50mph and was able to walk away with only minor bruises and being a little sore. The car was completely totaled but overall I was fine. My biggest complaint would be the infotainment is kind of slow and the navigation system does not work the best but you can always use android auto or apple carplay so not too big of a deal.  I also live in Arizona so having the remote start is great. I start the car from my office before I leave work and it cools it down quite a bit. I also like that the car has an actual spare tire. The only 2 things to improve for me personally would be more top end power even though the car is fast and improved navigation/infotainment system.,5

Having just ended a 3 year lease on a 2015 Honda Accord LX, I have to say that I have no regrets leasing the new Civic. The reason for changing from the Accord to the Civic is due to the awesome redesign of the10th generation. Being 6 foot and 2 inches tall I need a lot of leg room and I have plenty and also good head room because of the height adjustability that the driver seat has. The 2018 Honda Civic looks like it is in motion when it is parked and the car feels like a 4 door sports car.

1573, on 07/21/18 17:50 PM (PDT),AJ ,2018 Honda Civic  EX-L w/Navigation 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),EXL w/Nav Leather," Had the car for 45 days now, I drove it as a joke as I wanted to drive every 2018 in their line-up and I did, far and away the Civic, blew me away after owning 4 Accords in a row. I traded my 2011 Accord EXL in and its 8 inches shorter and has essentially the same cabin space. My major complaint is there are only three cup holders all located in the center counsel. They should have bubbled out the doors (all 4) and added 4 more cup holders. If you have owned a bunch of honda's in a row like me the technology is not quirky at all, you get the growth progression. Navigation is good, but sucks you can't use it while driving, quick fix is to program all of your locations and name and save them in advance, that way you can use them while in motion. The navigation is a built in Garmin and even tells you the posted speed limit on the road so you know how fast to go, a very important piece as the car has an eco mode (which I get 40-48 miles to the gallon on the highway driving like a normal human being), then you can pop it out of eco, in to normal drive and your car is extremely fast with the 1.5 turbo, you think it's quick in that mode, drop it into ""S"" for Sport Mode and hold onto your seats the car is fast. I've had several cars at stop lights or on the highway drive up and want to race. Yes, I've lost twice, I've beaten low end mustangs and camaro's with ease, I've beaten the SI Focus, and the SI Fiesta. Some upper level sport cars have gotten me but they rolled down their window at the stop light and couldn't believe they barely beat me. The brakes are phenomenal and so is the acceleration,  the heated seats are the best I've ever had, the A/C doesn't have vents to the back seat...but that's not a deal breaker, my kids can still get cooled off it just takes a little longer. The leather is high-end and very comfortable. This is a driver's car for sure and your listening to an Accord lover. I test drove the new Accord that has the same engine and it was just okay, it was heavier, slower, bigger, and didn't have as much excitement on the inside, ""yes,"" it had more cup holders and was a little more luxurious, whereas the Civic is a little more edgy and sporty. If you want the Accord that screams around the like the Civic, you have to get the 2.0T which will run you $35,800, I just couldn't do it, I already own a Pilot Touring and if I'm spending that kind of money I'm getting another Pilot, but not the 2016, 17, or 18, which are all junk ""literally,"" The 2019 has just gone through a mid-model fix and is the one to buy in the new body style, otherwise stick with the 2012-15 models, your talking to a guy who has owned 2 Civics, 4 Accords, 3 Pilots, and 1 Odyssey. Rule of thumb with Honda, always buy the EXL, EXL with Nav, or Touring Models new or used. If you have to settle due to budget the EX works but you lose leather and heated seats and some other things as well. Don't even bother with a model below that....you will get your return on investment on the other models regardless of miles. I got 6K on trade for my 2011 Accord that had 145K miles on it. The trunk space in the Civic 4 door Sedan I have is huge, the leg room in the front seat and back seat is better than my 2011 Accord and I',\m 2012lbs and 6' tall. Even with my wife and three kids the turbo engine does it's thing and you don't lose performance due to the added weight. If your radio and nav behave weird, or abnormally, hold the audio button for 15 seconds and it will reboot like a phone, remember it's a computer and needs to be restarted every so often. One other quirk with the Nav is that I jump time zones for work, so when I leave the CST for the EST zone the Nav gives me the arrival time in the timezone I'm in, not the one I'm heading to, this is very primitive as this was worked out in the older honda's, but as soon as I'm in the EST time zone it adjusts itself, I've gotten used to it. For those who complain about gas mileage, it is a cap-less system, so take your time when pumping, and top off your tank several times by gradually pulling out the nozzle as you pump and pump slow at the end. If you drive like a grandma, the gas mileage will blow your mind, highway miles are nuts, if you like to have fun in town and use the turbo, which you will, you still get a good combo of in-town/hwy between 32-37 combined mpg, the car is just a driver's car and your going to want to get on it. With that said, the A/C, Nav, and cup-holder issue is not enough to make your have buyers remorse, I get complements all the time. I bought OEM mud-guards and put them on myself, I had it tinted, and I'm ordering the all-weather mats as I have the white exterior and black interior. This car is ""tight,"" my wife takes it every chance she gets. I've drive the Acura ILX built on the same platform and my EXL with Nav blows it away on all level. There is nearly no road noise other than the throaty turbo when I'm getting on it, what a freakin' car!!!",5

I test drove the 2018 Camry SE, and had plans to buy it, but one day on my way to work I saw a Honda Civic Sport, loved the way it looked and started to do some research. That brought me to the Civic Si, and after a test drive, I loved it. It's priced about $2500 less than the Camry SE, gets about the same gas mileage, but has 6 speed manual! After a couple of months of back and forth negotiations, I came out with the Si for $22K. Without getting into to much details...this car is fast. Very fast. And it handles the road like an expensive sports car. It begs you to drive it hard, and it rewards you for it. The only thing I don't like is that people are always coming up on my bumper or to my side wanting to race or see if they can beat me.

I am a life long Honda owner so I am very biased, but I did find this one to be the most fun to drive while looking cool and having decent mileage. After having the car for over a month my primary gripes are: 1. The stereo is just not great. Wish there were more USB ports. The Bluetooth unmatches from my iPhone constantly. 2. Because I wanted a manual transmission some of the other upgrades were unavailable to me like: moon roof, leather seats, and what I wanted most: Apple CarPlay. This was a huge bummer. 3. Premium gas is recommended... which can get pricey. 4. I wish Honda offered factory car racks especially for such a sporty car. 5. Someone mentioned an issue with the A/C getting cooler which I agree with. All that being said, I was able to stay within my budget and I am happy with the car. If the Touring version had a stick shift I would have sprung for it, it but I understand there is not much of a market for stick shifts.

1601, on 03/26/18 09:47 AM (PDT),John Carocci ,2018 Honda Civic  LX 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Civic Coupe Punches Up," First, some background. I was a loyal Hyundai driver for many years. They were a good value and reliable transportation. Until I got one that was neither. It died for good two months before it was paid for. I test drove a Honda Fit and became a loyal Honda driver in less than half an hour. The Fit rode nicely, had a great interior, swallowed all my cargo and got excellent mileage. All with a feeling of quality that far surpassed my Hyundais. Only two things kept my Fit from perfection - I wasn't able to get a manual (I was under the gun and didn't have time to wait) and, well, the looks. I recently bought a Honda Civic Coupe in the LX trim, with a manual transmission. The very bottom of the Civic ladder, but it drives and feels and looks like a premium car. I couldn't be happier. The 2.0L engine has 158 HP and is more than powerful enough for city and highway driving. I can't compare it to the 1.5L Turbo since I never drove that one, but my Civic is up to anything I've thrown at it so far. The manual transmission is fantastic. Very smooth, and very forgiving. After a bit over a month, I'm averaging 32 mpg in mixed driving. The downsides are more about it being a coupe - the doors are huge, and you sit very low, so getting in and out might be tough for people who are older or have mobility issues. The visibility could be better, but I'm coming from a Fit which had exceptional visibility all around. It's also probably not a good choice for people with children, as the back seat is tough to get in and out of for things like child seats, etc. What I like best is that after a lifetime of economy car compromises, I'm driving an economy car that doesn't make me feel like I'm settling.",4

Car gets plenty of compliments on its sporty looks, although I feel the rear bumper looks a bit like it’s trying too hard. Love the versatility of the hatchback - shockingly large cargo space when seats folded down. Plenty of legroom for tall adults in rear and rear seat definitely doesn’t sit like it was an afterthought. Rear and passenger side cameras really nice, but am definitely missing the blind spot warning light in the driver mirror I think all cars should have.

This is an incredibly fun to drive car for the money at $22,000 before tax and the other dealer charges. The press is stupid tough on this car probably because the Type R is so damn good from what I've read no test drives are still allowed. But this car is far cheaper, is a two door coupe, and does not look like it came out of a cereal box! The handling is incredible, engine power is great for a 1.5 liter engine, the controls are perfectly placed and logical, the stereo sounds amazing turned all the way up, the shifter and clutch are Honda perfection, the steering is amazing, the limited slip differential pulls the car out of turns and provides improved traction in inclement weather, the all-season tires offer great grip in all conditions and there is no need to have another set just for winter, the visibility is great especially considering it is a two door, the interior and trunk have tons of room for such a small car, and the gas mileage is great as I have been averaging 32 mpg in seriously frigid New England winter temperatures! My only gripe is that with the dampers in the normal mode the ride is a bit much on bumpy pavement but that is it. And I am surprised of all the attention this car gets on the road. Maybe it is the nice pearl white on my car or the fact that every vehicle on the road has four doors and is some type of stupid cross over / suv I am not sure. I've had many performance cars in the past (vortech supercharged Honda S2000, three Camaros, among some others) as well as other Honda vehicles but I am telling you do not listen to the press reviews on this car except maybe for Car and Driver who has put the Si on their ten best list along with the Sport hatch and Type R. It is well deserved indeed. Check one out for yourself, life is short. You will not be disappointed.",5
1612, on 12/23/17 09:16 AM (PST),Tim P ,2018 Honda Civic  Sport 4dr Hatchback (1.5L 4cyl Turbo 6M),The Hatchback Sport totally rocks," Love my new 2018 Civic Hatchback Sport! I had previously purchased a 2015 Civic EX with leather and a navigation system after trading in a 2004 Accord. I liked that car and it had basically every upgrade including a sunroof, leather seats, nice stereo, etc. I expected to keep it for 10 or more years. Since then, Honda has really done a lot with the Civic line. The 2018 Civic Sport Hatchback is a beautiful vehicle. Make no mistake, my 2015 Civic sedan was drab by comparison. So the Sport hatchback not only looks great -- if it didn't have the Honda logo you would swear it was a BMW or Mercedes perhaps --  It drives like a sports car. It is much faster than the 2015 due to the turbo engine, and the wheels and suspension definitely give it a sports car feel when cornering. The ""cockpit"" has a much better overall look than the 2015, again reminds you of a BMW.  The seats are pretty darn nice though I ""downgraded"" from leather in my 2015 -- they look great and I think they will last very well.  Nice touches include one of the cooler, more sporty looking dual exhausts around, and of course the 18 inch wheels look and perform great. All in all, it to me is a huge upgrade from my 2015 Civic, which was a really nice car. It cost me $10.2K to trade in at this point, which hurts a bit, but no regrets. The car that I have now has a sticker price $2000 less than the sticker price of the 2015 Civic, which seems odd in a way.  It looks great in black, by the way.",5

We had a 2005 Avalon, a 2009 Venza, and then traded for a 2017 Highlander. At trade in time at the dealership, we were going to keep the Venza for our son. The dealership kept offering us more and higher offers to get our Venza, so we finally traded it in for a great price. Got to love the higher trade in values of Toyotas! All of these vehicles had the 3.5 liter engine, which has very good power and fuel economy. And all 3 Toyotas had completely trouble free miles. We waited until the 2017 Highlander was available so we could buy the newest safety tech., plus engine has more power etc.. Had the dealership install a trailer hitch, so we can tow up to 5 k pounds. We live in the Reno/Tahoe area and this vehicle does great year round. Whether it is cruising up to the lake, or airport duty hauling people and bags, it is just the right size. The XLE we bought, had center bench seats. The only thing we might have changed, would have been getting center bucket seats, for a little more support on longer trips.

Water pools above doors and drenches you when entering and exiting after a rain. The second row rear seats should have been designed to fold flat. The GPS system is awful.

Child locks are disengaged and people in rear still can't get out. Can't open rear hatch unless car is off.  Power mode cannot be set as a default. Don't trust the auto high beams.

It's not possible that they are unaware so that means Toyota's sales training has advised them to just forget about informing their customers.  The average individual will not notice this without detailed inspection of them.  The plastic covers are permanently adhered to the wheel and since they can't be refinished the only option if they are damaged is to replace them at a cost of roughly $700 or more.  A bit expensive for a piece of fancy plastic.  Just be aware of what you're buying.  There are plenty of us out there who found this out too late.  The wheels on the XLE are a true metal wheel.,4

It's horrible. I am in real estate so I use it frequently. The Navigation will stop mid sentence, not recognize common names and cut me off when giving an address. The newest glitch is asking me ""Which city in Maine?"" That's a problem because I am in Indiana! The address's I have been putting in do not any words even close to Main. It was a little embarrassing when I had clients in the car when I asked ""Find directions to an address"" and the response was ""Find a dress.""

Major flaws I have noticed in my first 12,000 miles......the toyo tires are some of the worst tires I have ever driven to the point of being dangerous....fine it the dry but any moisture they spin and hydroplane.  I ended up putting new Continentals on and it makes a ton of difference. Wish I did;t have to incur that expense on a new car..... Toyota should be ashamed for using such poor tires on their top of the line Limited.  Secondly, the mirrors create major blind spots....especially when turning left.  You better triple check before turing......make sure you turn both directions on test drives as the dealerships must know this because they only turn right on test drives......I didn't notice that until I read some other reviews.  Last feature I don't personally car for is the Start/ Stop feature for red lights......I would rather turn that off....it can be done but you have to turn it off every time you get in the car.....I wish I could disable it.",4

The transmission was ""lost"" during shipping - the entire process has been awful. A new transmission had to be put into my ""new"" car.  I do not feel safe in this car which obviously was a lemon.

The ride is quiet and smooth and you feel safe and most features are great. We've put 28k on this in two years so it's been put to the test. Tons of room and seating is plentiful. But there are some problems that you should know before you spend what is basically luxury SUV prices. The front seats are OK but firm. Hard to go much longer than a few hours before you need to stop. The entertainment system absolutely doesn't work correctly. You have to disconnect and reconnect all of the time.

My first was a 2004.   I traded my black 70k mi 2014 XLE AWD for a 2017 gray/black LE Plus AWD.   Why the LE Plus over another XLE?  Well, the LE Plus has the features that I use/like the most on the road- power seat, leather wrapped wheel, upgraded audio (excellent sound quality), power lift gate with flipper window, 3 zone auto climate control.  After negotiating my best deal among 3 dealers, the LE Plus was 4K lessthan the XLE (you recoup some of the XLE cost when you sell, though).  The feature that I missed the most initially was keyless entry and go.  This is my first car in 15 years without a sunroof(which I don't really miss).  Really like my LE Plus - I added bodyside moldings, rear bumper protector and all weather mats.  It came with Michelin tires and the ride quality is superior to the deuhler HLs.  The safety sense is a great system, and the lane keeping feature is really neat.  I also like the auto dimming headlamps.   Overall, this Highlander is very comfortable for my 6'2"" frame and I would not hesitate to recommend it- its very reliable and has consistently high resale value.  The quality of the interior materials feels superior to most of its competitors.  I did look at the 2017 Pilot, which is larger, but the seat mounted armrests were uncomfortable and a deal breaker for me.  The interior of the Highlander is much nicer.",5

Toyota touts quality and safety features as their biggest sales pitch, seems it's there every time we turn on a tv. The transmission problem occurred at 8,253 miles, lucky for my wife, she was at a red light when the transmission failed and nobody was injured. The vehicle was hauled to local Toyota dealer on a flatbed & sat at the dealership for 52 days. We were told by dealer that a ""new"" transmission was back-ordered from California. After picking up the vehicle I noticed the workorder stated: ""part number 30510-48600-84 REMAN ATM and CORE RETURN"".

There is no improvement in driving experience; it is still comfortable but steering doesn’t give any feedback, suspension makes much more noise than previous one. There is no update on the Entune system, it looks and works like designed by amateur software team. Also material quality is far behind the new generation SUVs. There are still some good things about the car; good size, roomy interior, good snow traction, exterior design is better than other Toyotas, standard safety features works fine.Competition is getting hard in this segment, Toyota needs better chassis, transmission, electronics and material quality in and out.

1639, on 01/08/18 15:56 PM (PST),S. Tessmann ,2017 Toyota Highlander  XLE 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),"Update for ""Computerized Fiasco"" Review"," My original review entitled, ""Computerized Fiasco, Warranty Nightmare"" pertained to our experience in getting a malfunctioning radio repaired under warranty.  The so called ""speed-activated"" radio volume was erratic and not being regulated by the vehicle's speed.  My review was influenced by our frustration getting this fixed promptly under warranty.  Ultimately, the dealer did set up a ""one-visit"" appointment to diagnose the issue and had a replacement on hand.  The diagnosis confirmed there was an erratically fluctuating current (loose circuit?) in the system.  The warranty repair invoice indicates the radio unit was replaced and it now appears to be functioning per specification.Bear in mind we are in our mid 60s and technology-aversive.  That does not mean we have difficulty using new technology.  We just don't see the need and have little use for much of it.  Unfortunately, there is not a lot of choice in new vehicle packages.  My position on this is . . . lean to drive!  Don't depend on cameras, warning lights, and radar this, radar that to correct your mistakes when you're not paying attention!!!  And, especially don't make me pay a lot extra for all this wizardry.   And self-driving cars?  Don't even go there !!!Per my original review, I am still unhappy with the ""radar"" cruise control feature.  I have to physically turn it off every time I engage the cruise control, which is an extra step.  Other issues:  Too much complexity (too many features) in the computerized dash controls.  This can be very distracting while driving.  My only other complaint is I don't like the leather seats.  They are uncomfortable.  However, it's what my wife wanted and we have differing views on this.  Otherwise, the Highlander does drive nicely.  For the size vehicle, I would like the gas mileage to be 3-4 mpg better than it is, but 21 mpg is not all that bad.Another issue I have relates to my wife's prior Highlander, which will eventually pertain to the current model.  Cost of replacing struts is very excessive.  Most repair shops more than double the actual retail cost of the struts and then charge $110-$120 per hour for labor on top of that, resulting in estimates of over $1,000.  This is a far cry from the old days of replacing worn shocks.ORIGINAL REVIEW:     My wife wanted leather seats so we purchased the XLE model, which comes with electronic and computerized everything.  Although we paid for it, we will never use nor did we want 80% of the electronic wizardry that comes in this model.  Lots of computerized stuff ultimately equates to lots of opportunity for malfunctions.  The radio is ""speed-activated,"" meaning the volume is supposed to increase gradually as the vehicle speed increases to compensate for road noise .  The radio in our highlander is defective.  The volume erratically and abruptly increases and decreases at any speed, even while the vehicle is idling.  It's enough to drive you nuts.  The vehicle is under warranty so I told the dealership I wanted the system replaced in one visit.  In response, I got a lot of rigmarole about protocol and was told the system would need to be removed and sent off for diagnosis.  I told them this was unacceptable as it meant several 100-mile round trips to the dealership.  To no avail.  They arranged a Saturday morning appointment but then told us they would need authorization to replace the system and since Toyota's technical service office is not open on a weekend, they could not get the approval.  The technician downloaded a software service pack that did not correct the problem.  I called the Toyota ""customer care"" center to lodge my complaint and insist that the problem be corrected in one additional visit.  It was like talking to a trained puppet.  More rigmarole about protocol and ""I'm sorry you are being inconvenienced"" and ""I am unable to guarantee the problem will be fixed on your next visit.""  Protocol before customer service, always !!  The vehicle also comes with ""radar activated"" cruise control.  Although functioning properly in our vehicle, it's the most worthless, vexing thing I've ever encountered.  Who wants a cruise system that slows the vehicle as it approaches another vehicle you intend to pass?  Consequently, I have to manually turn off the radar system every time I use the cruise control.  This is another example of just too much technology that's poorly thought out.",4

The dealership rebalanced them and I suspect rotated the front to the rear.  It was taken back to the dealership for a more through test.  The problem was identified to be in the rear tires.  Added weights were installed on those tires.  I now have a new car that drives and sounds like I have off-road noisy grinding vibrating tires as low as 30 MPH on very smooth road surface.",4
1641, on 12/19/17 19:41 PM (PST),Travelmeister ,2017 Toyota Highlander  XLE 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Work Horse in Style," From a man's point of view, I wanted to have only one new vehicle for both intown and cross country travel. This 2017 Highlander LXE replaced a 2009 Highlander AWD Sport with 200K on it that only had one part (less than $400) replaced.  Obviously that vehicle was passed down in the family.  We pull a 4300 pound travel trailer and  with wind and elevation gain the 09 got around 9 to 10mpg at 70mph.  With no bike rack or trailer, it averaged 23-24mpg on the highway.  The 2017 gets around 15mpg pulling the trailer and pulls much easier with the additional HP and speeds.  My wife enjoys all the safety features, GPS and phone system.  We have had the vehicle for only 1 month so can not comment on reliability,",5
1642, on 12/17/17 16:10 PM (PST),Mike D ,2017 Toyota Highlander  XLE 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Not the Toyota I thought it would be," Having owned a few Camry's ('97, '03) and Avalon's ('05, '08) over the years, my expectation was one of Toyota quality, however I am disappointed.  Overall the SUV has two really good highlights.  The first is plenty of power...plenty.  This thing gets up and goes (as long as you manually take it out of ""economy mode"" default which causes it to run like a 4 cyl).  Second is fuel economy (auto start and stop feature is annoying but all cars have it now).  I travel about 30,000 miles a year and am averaging about 23 mpg. vs. 19 mpg in past Enclave ('15) and 18 mpg in Explorers ('12,'14) I have owned.  Overall fit and finish is good as with most Toyota's but here are the really frustrating things, in no particular order: 1. Whistling wind noise  driving at highway speeds from passenger side window/mirror.  2. Front USB chargers are very poorly placed tucked way under the gimmicky ""shelf"" on dash which is not as cool as you think it would be.  3. The touch screen is too far to reach from driving position.  Have to lean forward each time to make changes to audio etc.  4. Blue tooth voice command feature is very clunky, not intuitive and odd in comparison to Enclave and Explorer or any newer cars. You have to speak way too loud and give way too many commands just to make a phone call only to have them all reconfirmed in detail before dialing.  5. Sound system quality is mediocre in comparison to the Bose in Enclave mid priced model and base model system in Explorers.  Volume always seems too low.   6. Tailgate is a joke.  It beeps like 5 times and then begins the 5 minute opening journey.  Closing is same.  5 beeps warning everyone around you your tailgate is going to close and then it takes 5 minutes to close.  They seem to have countered it with the ability to open the back window as on older SUV's, but I would rather the tailgate to open and close faster.  I am not just being picky, I am comparing it to a bunch of other vehicles including my sister in law's Escalade, friends X5, neighbors Q7 etc.  All fast open and close.   6. Drivers seat will not go low enough for a over 6' tall driver.  Thus, if you sit in normal driving position you tend to look out of the top third of the windshield.  To counter, you need to lean seat back making it even more difficult to stretch to reach dash controls/touch screen.  7. ""Safety sense"" features are also very gimmicky.  They do work, however I find myself overwhelmed by all the beeps, lights and warnings. They could get away with the side sensor lane changing lights in mirrors and the rear end collision avoidance and it would be fine. Biggest problem: when it snows, the front radar sensor and camera in grill become covered with snow, the entire dash lights up like a Christmas tree and continues to flash with warnings all over the place to make sure you pull over to clean grille and front of car clearing off safety sensors. Warning lights can not be overridden or turned off until the sensors are cleaned off.  I would think it would be far more dangerous to pull over on the side of the highway in a snow storm to clean the sensors to enable the safety features on the car than it would be to drive without them.  I have driven this car on two trips in the snow and both times it happened.  POOR design.   8. When stopping at school or soccer practice to wait for my daughter, most recent cars I have had allow you to turn the car off and continue bluetooth phone call/listen to radio/roll down window etc until you open the door.   This car cuts you off as soon as you shut it off.  Very annoying.   I hope this gives you some insight.  Had I known about these items, I probably would have gone in a different direction.  Seems Toyota has lost its edge.",3

(2) Wind noise is very high especially on the passenger side and my dealer says nothing can be done to help.  (3) The seat belt alarm is VERY irritating and loud.  (a warning is fine but constant loud noise makes me dislike this car).   (4) The car is very hard to program and much too hard for me to even begin to explore the options available.    (5) I cannot find any way to have more than one cell phone connected at a time, so I am unable to have both my phone and my wife's phone connected (one or the other at a time).   (6) The feature that shuts down the engine while at a stop light is very agitating and should be a option to either always on or always off.  Lastly I would like to comment on the dealership.  I was very disappointed in the dealer in my city as I felt like I was being forced into buying things I did not want to buy and almost (should have) walked out during the finance meeting.

Only thing less than perfect are the front seat comfort is not quite soft enough for my old back (my wife who is picker than me has no complaints and thinks the ride is better than her Lexus) and the voice activated command is very temperamental.

The view looking out the windows, with this body design, is poor.Lastly it would be nice if the passenger front seat would adjust for height. If your tall your can lower the drivers seat and its great but if your a passenger in the front you will be hitting your head. Over all nice vehicle.",4

1656, on 10/08/17 12:58 PM (PDT),MB ,2017 Toyota Highlander  Limited Platinum 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),The excellent all-around 3 row crossover," I considered many different vehicles including other crossovers as well as large body on frame SUVs (Land Cruiser, Ford Expedition) but settled on the Highlander because it offers great utility and people carrying ability in a platform that is relatively fuel efficient (20.5 mpg mixed/24 mpg highway) but still offers moderate towing capacity.  First the good:  Great fit and finish, solidly built, very high quality interior (many parts would look at home in a Lexus), smooth engine, great acceleration for a 5000+ lbs vehicle, roomy 2nd row seat, drives like a compact SUV, great projected reliability and 5 year residual value.  And the not so good:  3rd row seat is tight for adults (wouldn't plan on adults in the back for a road trip), no LED/HID headlights available at any trim level, no Apple Carplay/Android Auto, Navigation looks somewhat dated, infotainment screen hard to read in the sun or with polarized sunglasses, 8 speed auto has occasional rough upshift.  Overall I am very pleased with the Highlander Limited Platinum.  It has almost every bell and whistle and is a very comfortable and easy to drive vehicle.  I'm hopeful it lives up to its reputation for reliability.",5

It has all of the most modern safety features including Blind spot, Lane assist, Lane departure, brake assist, collision avoidance, and radar cruise control. It drives very nicely and the steering wheel feels good and is heated. This SUV drives more like a large four door sedan than a SUV. The front seats are very comfortable with heated and cooled options.  The second row is heated but not cooled. The power lift gate is nice and you can open the back window without opening the gate. The only problem so far is matching the EPA gas mileage expectation.I am updating my review from last September, 2017 when I first acquired this vehicle. It continues to impress me as I am amazed at the ride and comfort it provides. I did not think that it would satisfy my needs so completely. I have a slight physical impairment and driving this car helps me tremendously with this medical condition. I and my family feel very safe when we are in this vehicle. This is the first vehicle that I have ever owned that my wife will take away from me to go on one of her weekend girlfriend trips. We would definitely recommend this vehicle over any other in its class!",5

1662, on 09/18/17 06:37 AM (PDT),GO ,2017 Toyota Highlander  LE Plus 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Best Mid-Range SUV," This is my 3rd Highlander, and they keep getting better every time.  My first Highlander was in 2006 and it was the size of the current RAV4.  This new one has more room in the rear and the back seat legroom.  The from passenger compartment feels like it has a slight bit more width as well.  The controls (radio/camera, etc.) are easier to use and more intuitive than before.  The only wish I had was that they were angled slightly towards the driver.  This is my first vehicle that allows you to shut off the car while in drive and at a stop by simply depressing the brake.  This has increased the gas mileage for me.  My last Highlander was a 2012.  I got about 360 miles to a tank (regular driving) on a 17 gallon tank (21.1 MPG).  The new one, with the same size tank is getting 425 miles to the same 17 gallon tank (25 MPG).  The comfort is better, and not just because it is new.  I chose the LE Plus because of the full 60/40 rear seats.  I did not want the captains rear seats, as it is impossible for someone to lay down on longer trips.  I also did not want the sun/moon roof (hardly used it and one less thing to worry about going wrong).  Plus the price difference for 2 things I didn't want really made my decision easier.",5

The entertainment system reminds me of how the phone carriers destroyed the handsets until Apple came along and broke their hold on the software aspect of purchasing phones.  It was the carrier's attempt at controlling the branding and access users had with their phones.  The same thing happens with the navigation and entertainment systems in Toyota.  While other companies have moved on to android and apple play, we're still stuck in 1980 with Entune ""entertainment system"".  Excluding that that, however, I do really like the Highlander.  If I didnt have children, however, this truck would not be in my garage.   Cons: Entune is horrible.  Mapping stinks.  Voice recognition is in name only.  It's not like I have an accent or dont enunciate correctly.  One last pet peeve: the gas milage is below the advertised amount. For the last 1000 miles, I've been getting only 19.1 mpg.  21-22 if I'm on the interstate.  Pathetic but not unexpected.The Pros are plenty: Roomy if a bit narrow for a 7 seater.  The 2 seats in the back are functional and fold away for extra storage room - I love this.  The safety system is great.  The truck as warned me to stop several times now when the car in front suddenly slams on breaks.  It's paid for itself many times!!",4

Even though the 2015 and 2017 models look somewhat similar (...minor changes in the lights) their power-train is completely different.  The new engine is good (more power, and yet more efficient) but the new 8 speed transmission is just TERRIBLE!  It changes gears too quickly and it seems like the car is always under-powered.  When merging onto the freeway, changing lanes, going up-hills, or ... there is a significant lag between pressing the accelerator and the vehicle responding!!!   Very disappointing... Much different than my 2015, or even the 2012 model.  Also, I get about 19-20 MPG for combined driving (... i do live in a ""hilly"" area though).  I hope this helps!",3

I had own 2010 highlander and decided to go for new. Worst decision. The performance is extremely poor on 8 speed gear box. The vehicle is hesitant to start or accelerate from a stop signal, people will overtake you and look you like what the f*** you are doing. RPM goes all the way to 5000 still the car doesn't move. I heard about a new software released from Toyota for this issue and updated it, slight improvement but I hate it. Vehicle is stalling at lower gear and too quick gear change. I was really surprised Toyota is releasing a car with such worst transmission. I like everything else about this car, but whats the use when the heart of the vehicle is a failure.

1669, on 09/02/17 05:22 AM (PDT),RedSox Fan ,2017 Toyota Highlander  Limited Platinum 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),A poorman's Lexus," Update: After one year of ownership and over 17,000 miles the vehicle has held up well. Since the rattling was repaired there has not been another issue with the vehicle. It has been comfortable on the highway and like a tank through the Winter snows. We still love the panoramic sunroof, but what was a surprise was how often the heated steering wheel has been used. The biggest concerns are what will cause us to not buy another Toyota or Lexus vehicle after this one. The company continues to force the default setting to be on 'Eco'. Every time you start the car you have to go through a menu to select 'Power'. Driving in Eco mode proved to be a dawg just like what we experienced with the Lexus. It continues to be frustrating. Just make a software update to allow us to have Power as the default! The second concern is, there is just no excitement driving the car. It can best be described as bland. An appliance. Gets the job down reliably and comfortably, but unlike other cars we've had in the past you just never want to take off for a drive for the fun of it. If that was what Toyota was aiming for then they truly succeeded. Also, the V6 needs some more ponies. Even in Power mode it never feels sprightly. Perhaps a turbo would help here.Replaced the Lexus two days ago with this Highlander since we didn't like the styling of the latest RX350 ( even after owning an NX200t for two years).  You can definitely see more hard plastic around the Toyota, but you also receive more 'goodies' for the lower price and most impotantly, space. Lexus seems to be designed more for style than utility. Even though we've only put <100 miles on it, we can tell it will be a great highway cruiser. The panoramic sunroof is fantastic as is the stereo. Too bad we already have reliability concerns though. There is a rattling in the back that started yesterday that has become annoying to the point we don't want to use the car. And of course the dealership service is not available to look at it til Tuesday when I am back in the office. Not a good start at all especially considering the high priced paid. After owning 10 Toyotas and Lexus models, how this all plays out could decide if this is our final one for life.",4

The 8 speed can't seem to decide which gear it should be in.Update - Have owned this car for 13 months, now have 8900 miles on it. Everything is great except for acceleration. This car is a dog from a standing start. It was so frustrating I was considering getting rid of it. I installed a “PEDAL COMMANDER” on this car. That fixed the problem. I run it in sport mode.

Bluetooth connection to cell phone/pandora good.  Seats very comfortable in front, with firm good support.  Would prefer stronger seat covering than cloth, but this is base trim.  Would prefer LED or high intensity headlights, but not on this trim.  Good acceleration, very good road holding.  Road trip from Colorado to Calgary and back via Glacier, Banff, Yellowstone, with 5 adults and baggage comfortable, except for third row seating.  Mileage for trip:  24.5 - 25.5 mpg.  Car very smooth, and so far, pleasure to drive.   Bought Toyota Platinum Extended warranty, zero deductible 125,000 miles, 10 years.  Would be great if I never have to use it.  So far, I am happy with the purchase.  Things to watch for when purchasing:   Make sure gas, and temp gauges are working and are accurate.  If must be replaced, part of instrument cluster which must be replaced as a unit, and includes the odometer.  Toyota can be difficult about this, requiring car to be left at dealer for several weeks while part ordered.  Check this thoroughly on test drive.================================================Update 1/15/18:  One star removed (now 4 stars) due to perceived cost of future maintenance, see following:  This is probably the most comfortable car I have ever owned.  It is responsive, quiet, handles well, holds the road well.  We are coming from US made Saturns, a 2007 Vue with 216,000 miles and 2004 Ion with 138,000 miles.  We keep cars forever, so reliability and longevity are key for us, as well as low costs of ownership, and low maintenance costs.  We were looking at RAV4, priced right, but seemed a little cramped... and the salesman suggested Highlander.  We drove an LE with V6 and AWD and really liked it.  Got a good price and the rest is history.  We like how the car drives and looks.  Very comfortable, with the performance being there when needed.  We are getting approx 24 - 25 mpg with a combination of highway and local driving.  We were able to purchase a Toyota extended warranty to 125,000 miles or 10 years (whichever comes first).  We would give the car a 5 star rating, except for  these items:  1). New plugs are required to maintain the emission warranty every 60,000 miles.  To get to the plugs, a manifold must be removed, raising the cost of the service.  2) At 120,000 miles replacement of a brake booster vacuum pump is required as part of regular maintenance.  The part alone is over $1,000... and labor is additional.  This is required maintenance and not considered an extended warranty item. 3) The wheels appear to be alloy wheels.  However, they are coated with clear plastic, which looks like they could be damaged by scraping a curb (ours are still fine, fingers crossed).  There seems to be no way to repair this damage other than replacing the wheel, which I am told cost $700 each if purchased from Toyota. I would like Toyota to focus a bit more on low cost of ownership.  4) We have not experienced this problem as we have an LE (manual rear hatch) but there are some reported instances of failure of the electrically operated rear hatch on other Highlander models.",4

Drove it to Florida from Ky for family vacation. Vehicle is quiet rides pretty good and handles well for an SUV. MPG is not what is advertised in my opinion if you are driving over 65MPH (which 70 and up is standard for our area now). We still have our 2008 Nissan Quest minivan and if I were to do it over, another minivan would be in store. However, my biggest complaint is the Audio system, Navigation, and the lack of Car Play and/or Android auto. If the Nav was better I could do without the Car Play and Android. But the Nav is horrible. And why can't we do map updates through our phones when on wifi?? Toyota has dropped the ball on this and don't do what we did and thought the Nav would be handy, it will cost you a ton of time, is hard to use, and just isn't near the level of Google maps and other competitors in the mapping world.

1684, on 09/15/18 07:45 AM (PDT),Nicole M. ,2017 Honda Pilot  Touring w/Navigation and Rear Entertainment System 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Honda Pilot Nightmare," We purchased a 2017 Honda Pilot in December 2016 with the hope of buying a nice, reliable vehicle based on Honda's reputation.  This SUV has been a nightmare.  We started having service issues at approximately 10,000 miles which included the back up camera not working, the navigation system failing, a rear window leak that required multiple visits to the dealership, traction control issues, and the most significant issue was the ""Emissions System Problem"".  The emission issue resulted in numerous visits for repairs (sometimes reported as an oil change) when we brought the vehicle in and they would perform the regular maintenance in conjunction with the warranty work.  After several visits associated with the emission issue, they replaced the catalytic converter and two gaskets, which did not resolve the issue.  If the vehicle had not been under warranty this would have cost us approximately $800 to repair.  About a week later the light was back on and they determined not all of the cylinders were properly functioning (keep in mind this has been a long running issue).  At that time they replaced the injector set as well as some cylinders, which if not under warranty this would have totaled just over $2,000.  As a working mom with three kids to drive to/from school and activities dealing with these issues has been a significant burden on our family.  Our vehicle currently has about 30,000 miles and is still under warranty, but we are beyond concerned about the warranty expiring.  We consulted legal counsel under the lemon law and also met with the General Manager Ken Snyder as CDA Honda is a local company and our preference is to get the reliable vehicle we thought we were purchasing.  In our conversation he spoke highly of what Honda does to take care of their customers and really supports the local dealerships.  Ken asked if ""swapping out"" the vehicle would work for us (that was my request under the lemon law); however, what he really meant was trade it in as we found out in the process when his staff sprang to life with the excitement of selling a new car.  After all of the transportation hardships we have dealt with for the past year and a half, the thought of paying more money (for a vehicle that might function better) just seemed completely unreasonable.  We received a letter from CDA Honda approximately a month ago indicating Honda was reviewing our case and have had zero follow up from Ken Snyder or anyone else at CDA Honda.  When I inquired on the status I was informed it was with Honda and out of their control.  The finger pointing began and it is particularly frustrating as a consumer when we are struck with a product that is not reliable.  During the purchasing process we could have saved money by going to a larger dealership or purchasing one from Boise/Seattle, but we always want to support local businesses and keep money in our local economy (cash purchase).  While everyone in the service department has been friendly, there has been no effort to proactively resolve this issue and we feel that it would be absolutely unconscionable to sell this vehicle (as a private party).  Historically we have purchased new vehicles and have drove them for years.  We currently have a Toyota with 130,000 miles that we use for family trips since our Honda Pilot with 30,000 hasn't been reliable and we are uncomfortable driving it too far from home.",1

The inside of the vehicle often smells overwhelmingly like gasoline...combined with burning oil. It’s awful. Honda said they remedied this in 2016. Nope. A friend got in it yesterday and almost had an asthma attack. Called the dealer and they said they’ve never heard of it before. Ya, ok. I read all about the gas tank recall in 2016. It was clearly not the only issue. Ugh. I want to like this SUV, but at $50,000? I’ll continue documenting times the cabin fills with fumes. Hoping when I take it in they’ll be honest and know how to fix it.",3

We got a GREAT deal on this vehicle because they had a bunch of 2018s on the lot and wanted to clear out the few 2017s that were left. Brand new for thousands less? Yes please! We traded in a 2012 Ford Explorer Limited. I liked my Explorer ... I LOVE my Honda. The 9 speed transmission doesn't bother me like it bothers some other reviewers; and I actually really like the side view camera. I originally had my heart set on a Toyota Highlander, but when we actually drove one I was very underwhelmed by it. Driving the Highlander I thought ""meh. It's nice, but I don't HAVE to have it."" It felt small inside, the third row was tiny, and it just didn't wow me like I thought it would. On a whim we decided to stop at the local Honda dealership on our way home just to take a look at the Pilots and maybe test drive one. I ended up falling in love with it as soon as I sat inside and we bought it that afternoon. It handles exceptionally well in snow and ice, even on our steep and often cumbersome driveway. I love the adaptive cruise, and I don't find the forward collision warning system overly sensitive as some other reviews have suggested. The Pilot is much roomier inside than both my Explorer and the Highlander we drove. I thought I wanted the Elite to get the middle row captain's chairs but then our salesman showed me the one-touch sliding seats and that sealed the deal. Our biggest issue was third row accessibility and the one-touch seat makes that so easy without sacrificing a seat. It even works with a car seat in place. Driving it is a dream; it feels very solid and sturdy. It corners very well and feels more like a car to me than a three row SUV. I love that it sits up a bit higher; this makes visibility better and also makes it handle better in the snow than my Explorer did. I was a loyal Honda and Acura owner for years before buying a Ford, and now that I am back in a Honda I wonder why I ever left. We are very happy with our choice and plan to keep this vehicle for many years!",5
1693, on 02/26/18 10:00 AM (PST),Anthony Lo ,2017 Honda Pilot  EX 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Good Choice for large SUV," After extensive research for two years, we decided to purchase a 2017 Pilot to fill our need for a 7-8 passenger vehicle. Considered many, many makes and models include the Mazda CX-9, Toyota Sienna AWD, Toyota Highlander, Audi Q7, VW Atlas, Nissan Pathfinder. Key criteria for purchasing was sufficient third seat room, dimensions that could fit in our garage, reliability, resale value and safety. Boiled down to two vehicles: the Pilot and the Sienna AWD. Despite the convenience of the sliding doors and positive reviews, we just couldn't pull the trigger on the minivan. A bit too long for our garage anyway. Overall we are pleased with our Pilot EX AWD model. We opted for the fabric interior since (from our experience) leather ends up cracking and looking pretty frumpy over time even with conditioning/treatment. Quick rundown based on our early experience. Positives: Good interior room, plenty of third row passenger space, excellent ride quality, back up camera that functions well, nice large center console display, LED DRLs that look great, decent handling. Negatives: snow traction is just average (especially compared to our 2013 Subaru Outback), touchscreen display is slow to react, some interior material choices (ex. hard plastic for second row doors instead of soft touch like first row), no standard roof rails, no standard LED low/high beams, fuel economy average, narrow opening for third row access. As I said overall we're pretty pleased with our Pilot so far particularly the interior room and drivability. We will update this review in a few months when we have the vehicle broken in completely. The only other vehicle we would have considered is the upcoming Subaru Ascent but I wouldn't want to a first year model owner.",4

I don't see what the fuss is about the radio not having ""buttons"", just use the steering wheel controls.  I bought a close out 2017 EXL as Edmunds recommended.  I passed on the sensing but went for the AWD.  No need to Nav or RES.  I was able to get 0.9% financing along with $1,500 below invoice using Costco pricing and haggling with 2 different dealers.  I looked at the Highlander and Acadia.  No contest.  Highlander is way to small and the GMC/Chevy don't hold their value.  Traded in our 2013 Toyota Sienna, which I thought was a pretty good vehcile, until I drove the Pilot.  After the test drive, I was hooked and had to have one.  Besides the ride and fit and finish, I really enjoy the apple car play and the how you can customize a lot of the settings in the radio.  That said, I have 2 gripes.  1. no 3rd row floormat AND you can't buy one from Honda unless you buy all the floormats?  So, I bought one from Lloyds mats ($34).  It is just really odd that this isn't included in the EXL.   2. No 12V acc plug in the 2nd row.  My 2005 has one, why not my 2017?   So, I bought a 6ft plug to put in the front and stretch back to the second row.  Again, really odd.  You get one with the RES but not in the base EXL.  Other than that, you will love this car.",5

1699, on 01/19/18 21:20 PM (PST),Channing ,2017 Honda Pilot  EX-L 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),First and last Honda," It is apparent that Honda is living in the shadow of their reputation from the 90's and 2000's. We just purchased a fully loaded  EX-L because of the bad reviews of the touring and elite having the 9 speed transmission.  The suv had only 8 thousand miles, and was purchased from a very reputable dealer.  After driving it for a few days, my wife noticed moisture in the front passenger floorboard. When I checked out the vehicle, the entire floorboard (All 4 doors)was completely saturated with water. The next thing we noticed was that the front passenger seatbelt was covered with mold. We took the vehicle to the Honda dealer to get it fixed. I called the service department after 24 hours to see what was going on. The service advisor said it was ready to go. I said wait, what was the issue? He said someone must have hit the button on the remote and made the windows go down in the rain.  I told him that was impossible, because we would have seen water on the seats, door panels, and everywhere else. So they kept the car for a few more days and said they found some seepage on the top rail molding and put some filler in it. He said it was finished and ready to go. I said what about the mold on the seatbelt? He said they cleaned it off, and they would not replace it. I said I was in the mold remediation business for many years, and you cannot just clean mold from porous surfaces. So he said he would talk to his boss. I got a call later from the advisor saying he has never lied to his customers and he wasn't going to start. He said they found a significant amount of water inside the seatbelt retractor.and they were getting an engineer to take the vehicle to a rain machine to do tests, and he didn't know when we would get it back. So a few more days later they found some bad welds or seams under the vehicle, and said they repaired it and ordered new carpet. I ask what about the moldy seatbelt. They refused to replace the seatbelt, so I let him know that we were not going to take the vehicle back. We have a baby, and she would not be riding in a vehicle that we paid $35k for, and has mold and bad welds. We decided to try out a touring pilot since there were no others to choose from. As soon as we checked the carpet on the 2017 touring, it was soaked on the passenger side. That was the end of Honda for us. We traded for a 2017 Toyota Highlander and are very happy we are through with Hondas.",1

Mostly positive for the Pilot - love the safety features, quality is very good, text & message system is exceptional, like the front end ground clearance - no more scraping curbs when pulling in.

1717, on 12/02/17 07:40 AM (PST),Piloteer1 ,2017 Honda Pilot  EX-L 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),It's  a Honda," Great value when selecting trim levels.  Almost all or nothing.  I can only imagine what you get with Touring and Elite trims.  Wife wanted more bells and whistles from what we had in a 2012 Pilot LX.  EX interior was rough like denim and looked like it would be too hard to remove stains.  EX-L adds luxury with leather, sunroof, power front row seating, and a host of other little overlooked conveniences.  I read complaints on the infotainment limits, but we love it and haven't seen what all the fuss is about.  We have to master the steering wheel buttons to keep our eyes on driving.  The Android Auto app integration is amazing.  I'm sketchy on the privacy tradeoff though.  But beats 1-2k for built in his.  The touchscreen is responsive to our liking.  Went with 2wd because I didn't like the 12' and due to sluggish acceleration and roughness.  The ride quality is great.  Nix the nitrogen option if you can, mixed opinion if it does anything.  Eco mode is noticeable because it throttles ac, acceleration and such.  Very nimble from takeoff without eco mode.  I'd use on highway more.  Shifting is almost unnoticeable with 6 speed transmission.  Still contemplating extended warranty since there is a lot of electronics involved.  Lane assist is useful, again maybe more in a highway scenario.  Looked at Toyota Highlander and 4runner, both couldn't beat the Pilot's 3rd row capacity without pushing 2nd all the way foward.  Didn't see the need for Honda-sensing, I'd like a to retain some decision making while driving.  I've had 5 Hondas before this, and the 2017 exl is a winner in my mind.  Only reason for some 4 stars is I just bought and don't know.**** Update 6/5/18:  After 6 months we have no complaints.  Responsive and smooth on the highway.  Time for first oil change and tire rotation.  No recalls or items to have fixed, yet.  Hopefully didn't jinx myself but it's been that good.  The Android Auto is a great feature unless of course you lose wireless phone signal out in the middle of nowhere.  Still haven't learned all the steering wheel buttons and touchscreen takes getting used to.  Remote start is great on cold mornings and push start takes getting used to (accessory mode with foot off brake).",5

1720, on 11/16/17 11:08 AM (PST),BruceW ,2017 Honda Pilot  EX-L w/Navigation 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),9-speed models are not safe, Pilot can be bought with the navigation system only in the top trim models and these also have the 9-speed transmission. I took a test drive on the freeway and when accelerating onto the freeway to merge safely with traffic I floored the accelerator pedal and then waited a full 4 seconds before the transmission downshifted and the car computer fed more fuel to the engine and the car started to accelerate. When I simulated a passing situation by moving into the left lane and flooring the accelerator pedal the same thing happened. No response at all for 4 seconds and then finally the car started to accelerate. The published 0-60 MPH times with the Pilot are not at all accurate with the 9-speed transmission. Add 4 seconds to the time and you will appreciate why I do not consider the Pilot safe to drive on the highway. The other con for me was the feel of the electronic steering where there was no feedback and it was further complicated by the odd profile of the steering wheel that is rectangular rather than round. The storage space is exceptional with the Pilot and the navigation system that uses Garmin technology like that found in the Garmin 760 is outstanding and the best of any SUV at this time. I would only buy one of the two trim levels that have the 6-speed transmission and based on that I decided to instead buy a 2018 Chevy Traverse.,2

I wanted to love it. I feel like the design engineers failed me. The vehicle is far behind the curve on technology which is very disappointing. The Elite model should come with all of the most modern bells and whistles.   It should nearly drive itself. Regardless… That is not what I was looking for. I was looking for safety in the form of acceleration… The ability to get out of trouble very quickly on the freeway. As I was test driving the vehicle, I told the sales  person sitting in the front passenger seat that the next test was going to make or break the deal. I told him to count the number of seconds from the time that I said ""now"" until he felt the G forces of acceleration pushing him into the seat.  I told him anything over 0.5 seconds would be a failure. On the first test, it took three seconds for acceleration to kick in.  We perform the test three more times, and at no time,  did it take less than 2.5 seconds for acceleration to check in. That is not enough time to get out of a bad situation. After we return, the sales  person brought his chief mechanic to talk to me. The mechanic told me that I could have a third-party reprogram the transmission to give me what I wanted in acceleration, but it would void the warranty.   I'm not going to spend close to $50,000 just to have my warranty voided to bring the car up to where it should already be. Because of this, I am giving the 2017 Honda Pilot a two star rating.",3

I've driven several mid-size SUV's; Buick, Nissan Rogue, Jeep, etc., and found myself not considering anything but a Honda; its sleek, stylish from  boxy style of years past.  I'm still reading my owners manual & learning what this mid-priced model is equipped with!",5

The active safety features such as lane assist and active cruise control take some getting use to and can be a little intrusive but works relatively well.  I spent some time negotiating an out of the door all inclusive price via email so I did not have to deal with the usual sales process and it worked out well.  No regrets so far.Update March 2018Owned the Pilot for over 6 months now. Absolutely zero regrets. It's my wife's car and I look for excuses to take it out when ever I can. Continues to be smooth and quiet. I have got used to much of the electronics and controls. I am really digging the adaptive cruise control, the auto headlights and wipers. It all 'just works'. It was for us an expensive car but neither my wife or I regret it. Had one oil change so car and other than that it has not yet gone to the shop.",4
1732, on 09/07/17 08:17 AM (PDT),Nalini ,2017 Honda Pilot  Touring w/Navigation and Rear Entertainment System 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Great SUV, So far I have 1100 miles on it. I am really enjoying the smooth ride. I traded in my 2016 Toyota Highlander for the pilot. I do miss my Highlander but the pilot has so much more options. I don't need the DVD player that you automatically get with this version but it will add value later. The car appleplay is okay. I don't like having to plug in my phone each time to use it. It could be improved. This vehicle has a auto engine idle. The navigation is neat. It shows you exactly where you are as if you are looking from the sky. It even has pictures of exit signs. The sensing is not as sensitive as people have stated. Its doing what is it suppose to do. Lots of interior storage. Leg room is good. The car seems so much bigger from the inside. Overall I am very happy with the purchase,5
1733, on 09/04/17 12:22 PM (PDT),Tad Deuel ,2017 Honda Pilot  EX w/Honda Sensing 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),My Honda Pilot Experience," I was in the market for a mid-sized SUV and shopped online for either a Toyota Highlander or a Honda Pilot.  I had purchased my Honda CR-V EX from Carbone Honda of Bennington, VT the last time I shopped for a vehicle and after a lot of online comparisons from multiple dealerships, I decided to try Carbone Honda in Bennington once again because I knew they were also a Toyota dealership so I could make side-by-side comparisons of the two vehicles.  My salesperson, Rob Albreada was superb in describing the pros and cons of both vehicles.  Because the Pilot's interior was slightly larger than the Highlander (Rob actually measured both interiors with the rear seats folded down), I knew the reliability of Honda products, and the overall look and feel of the vehicle, I decided to purchase the Pilot.  I have had two lengthy trips in the Pilot since buying it and have been extremely happy to have made the choice I did.  The Pilot boasts of 18-26 with an average of 21 mpg but on each trip with the ECO Boost engaged I actually got 28.9 mpg.  The Honda Lane Watch (passenger side camera) when passing vehicles makes it much safer to know it's ok to pull back into the main traffic lane.  The same goes for backing up in reverse with the rear camera.  Overall, this was the right choice for me.",5
1734, on 09/04/17 10:33 AM (PDT),Preston L Jackson ,2017 Honda Pilot  Touring w/Navigation and Rear Entertainment System 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Caution:  Adaptive Cruise Control/Collision Avoid," According to the dealer 2017 was the first year Honda offered Adaptive Cruise Control an any of it's vehicles. We bought the car in March 2017. On our first trip to Oregon from Utah, my wife and I, found the system to be dangerous. We set the system to begin braking at level 4 of 4 which is the longest distance detection setting.  The system would allowed the car on the freeway and at freeway speeds to approach another vehicle in the same lane at high speed then when within an unsafe distance (less than setting 4 should allow) the vehicle would slam on the brakes, reduce speed from 75-80 mph to under 60 and then hesitate accelerating while the vehicle in front would pull away.  The hesitation caused vehicles behind to brake or change lanes quickly to avoid collision.  After the first encounter I tested the system several more times. The situation did not occur every time, but enough to let me know not to trust the system.  In Adaptive Cruise our Pilot would also detect vehicles in the lane to the left of us and would not accelerate to highway speed.  Adaptive Cruise on our Pilot would also read across lanes when in a left turn on the freeway and apply the brakes at freeway speeds to less than 60 mph causing vehicles following in the same lane to apply brakes.  The system is way too sensitive!  The condition seems to worsen when the vehicle is in ADC and Collision Avoidance.  We stopped using the ADC and Collision Avoidance systems for the rest of the trip.  The regular cruise control seems to work well, but in regular cruise if you brake before changing lanes the system turns off and you then change lanes (so far so good), but when you push resume the vehicle only accelerates at 10 mph which takes forever to get out of the way of approaching vehicles. Be prepared to accelerate  and get out of the way using the gas pedal.  We used the Collision Avoidance system for the first 1,500 miles then turned it off because  the brake warning light would come on approximately every 50 miles for no reason at all.  I took it to the dealer and they looked at it for a couple of days then called and said all systems checked out ok.  I took it home then got a call from the dealer saying they would like to look further into my concerns.  They kept it for about a week. The dealer called and said it appeared all was working as designed.  I personally believed the car to be to dangerous to drive unless you don't use ADC or Collision Avoidance systems, which I paid for or you are prepared for the deficiencies.  I wouldn't let my wife drive the car and I couldn't in all moral conscious sell it to someone else knowing it was dangerous so I turned it back to the dealership in August 2017 after 5 months with 4,560 miles on it.  I had to take a $9,791 loss, but the company is now responsible for the vehicle.",3

Even the EX trim model came with a lot of nice features.  Gives a super smooth ride!  Opted not to step up to a higher trim and get the sunroof because it was noisy anyway.  We wanted an AWD but found that is hard to get in So Cal because manufacturers do not think divers in So Cal need that, so not many are sent there.\, had to settle for a 2WD.",5

It is comfortable, quiet, and a nice ride.   There is plenty of interior room, and head/leg room, even in the 2nd and 3rd rows.  Good storage between two front seats.  With the 60/40 3rd row split you can put different size cargo in and only give up minimal seating.  The rear 'trunk' space is very limited, so I would suggest installing roof rack bars and investing in a sturdy storage container.  The climate control and entertainment options keep all rows of travelers happy too.  Plenty of cupholders too. One of the issues I have experienced is a seriously over-sensitive front impact safety sense.  It 'screams' BRAKE at you and shakes the steering wheel even when there is no chance for front impact (this is especially true when vehicle is taking a corner to the right and there is a car coming around the same curve on the opposite side).  Can be very unnerving.",5
1737, on 08/12/17 14:10 PM (PDT),Mike Martin ,2017 Honda Pilot  Touring w/Navigation and Rear Entertainment System 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Less than 1000 miles," This is the first new car that I have purchased that I am thinking of trading after less than 1000 miles driven.  I bought the Pilot AWD Touring package because Honda forces you into that package to get some of the options.  I knew when I bought this SUV that I would hate the push button transmission and I do.  It has too many gears and at times, especially at lower speeds, it seems to get confused as to what gear it should be in.  I can really feel it when I turn down into my subdivision and kind of coast.  It seems to hunt for the right gear when you don't need to put your foot on the gas.  The default setting for Honda's gas rating is to turn the engine off at stops.  What a pain this is and I wonder what this will do in the long term to the starter and battery.  You can defeat this, but you have to remember to push another button every time you push the drive button.  Would be a great SUV if I could get over the transmission.  Buyer's remorse, wish I had gone with the Highlander or bought the EX-L without all the options that I thought that I wanted.  You don't really need all those options.",4

It never gets 18mpg in town as rated, more like 16.Overall this is a nice car to drive with fewer blind spots than others.

But, I freaking hate this car and wish I had bought an older model, which is sad because I haven't bought a new car in 13 years!  1)Auto Stop - if you are stopped for a tiny amount of time, the engine will shut off and restart when you move the steering wheel or take your foot off the brake.  IT IS UNNERVING!!  When I bought the car, the dealer said you can turn that irritation off but he meant you have to turn it off every time you start the car.  2)The freaking BEEPING - you can turn the incessant beeping off and risk backing into a brick wall if you're not used to the camera, or you can leave it on and have it annoy the living @!#%& out of you - when you're backing out of an underground spot with nothing for 2-3' in any direction, when you're rounding a tight turn on your daily trip home (??????), or when it thinks you're too close to a car in front of you - I'm not yet dead, I'm not blind, if I'm that close to a car in front of me it's because I WANT TO BE!!  3)The incredibly stupid feature that unlocks all the windows - my boyfriend says it's unlocking the doors, then holding the unlock button down.  However, it happened to me when I LOCKED the car and not sure what got pressed as the key jostled in my purse.  In any case, who EVER wants all their windows opened unless they're IN THE CAR?  I live in Seattle - rain, rain and more rain, twice now in my car completely accidentally.  In summary of the features, TOO $%^&& MUCH! When I want a driverless car, I'll get one, til then LET ME DRIVE THE CAR!!!!!  And finally, I don't know if it's suspension or what, but going over  speed bumps or into a big profile driveway  (dozens of times a day for most people), is  detrimental to your spine.",2

It drives good, rides good, and is very quiet on the road.  It is filled with technology----almost to a fault.  It will take my wife and me some time to learn all of its features.  It is very smooth and is getting very good gas mileage.  I can't imagine that any SUV being made could have more features than does the Pilot.  It is also very roomy.  It also has all wheel drive and stability control, so is very sure footed in rain or snow.We took a 3,000 trip to the northeast, and the Pilot performed flawlessly.  It is very comfortable and will carry practically anything a traveler would want to take.  The nine speed transmission is very smooth and keeps the engine in an appropriate power/performance range.  The more I drive the car, the more I like and appreciate it.  After driving this Pilot for one year and 24,000 miles I still appreciate it so much.  It is solid as a rock.",5

This is the first one I have ever had to take to the dealer with a problem before 70,000 mile.  This car developed a clunk in the front drive train or suspension at about 3000 miles.  Of course the service department can find nothing wrong with it.  Honda is behind it's competitors when it comes to interior design.  Less leg room in the front driving compartment, controls are dated, other companies have lessen to their focus groups.  I think Honda miss the boat here.  Blind spot camara is useless, who looks at their center screen when changing lanes.  Really missed the boat here when comparing them to there competitors.  To many bad interior design features to mention.",2

The included options list implies that the Elite has everything the other models have plus more stuff. Not quite true. It does not tell you what is left out, so it's not completely clear what you are getting. Lane Watch is included in lesser models and I expected it should also be on the Elite. It isn't. Some reviews dislike Lane Watch because it takes your eyes away from the road. The Owner's Guide is inadequate. Photos are too small. Honda should include a full size Owner's Manual. Sure, you can go to their website and download the 679 pages and print it yourself but for a $50,000 Elite, you'd think they would give you one. The Guide shows an option that the Elite should have but doesn't. That is Folding Mirrors. This option would help to protect your mirrors from damage by folding them inwards.  Even though the Guide covers it, I did not see it listed as a feature on any of the models. I have yet to use the shifting paddles. I have not found any information yet on how to use them. I'll keep looking. Though not stylish, the Elite is very comfortable and has a lot of cargo space.After owning my Honda Pilot Elite for a year, I have come to appreciate it much more. It also helped to have received a FREE Owner's Manual from Honda. Also, I can now appreciate not having Lane Watch for changing lanes. The Elite has a much better system BSI, the blind spot information system that warns you with a warning beep and light when you are starting to change lanes and there is a car in either blinds spot, left or right. As soon as you put your signal on or begin to move into the lane it lights a warning and sounds a beep. No need to take your eyes off the road. The Pilot Elite is classy and comfortable. It has a peppy engine at 280 hp. I have to admit that I have not tried the shifting paddles. Not sure I care about them. It does fine on Drive and shifts smoothly. (I'm a former sports car driver and in my mind, it's heresy to replace the shift knob with paddles.) I like being able to open windows and moonroof remotely on a hot day and even start the engine that way. I love the ability to cool or heat the front leather seats. Also nice for my passengers in the middle captain's chairs to be able to heat their seats in winter. I added the option of rubber mats with tall sides and the folding cargo tray and recommend those. The Elite comes loaded so there is very little you'd want to add. I actually paid about $4,000 under MSRP but financing some of the cost plus various options raised my total outlay to $52,000, but even then, it is well worth that compared to the competition.",5

New features such as back up camera and passenger side camera for lane change and blind spot are great. Too bad it didn't include driver's side as well. Side mirrors fold back on this model is something that I wish was electronically adjustable as I fold them back every day manually. Plenty of room and great console. Plenty of compartments on the doors and back area's. Love the hatchback open ability from the key ring. Easy to open and close without having to do it manually. Touch unlock on the doors and key less start a big plus. Getting used to the higher ride for distance estimating in front takes a little getting used to. You can't really see the front of the car to judge how close you are. Bluetooth match up fine for our two Android phones however the interface for playing music from our phones doesn't have the flexibility for selecting songs, albums or playlists that the phone does. Using google maps from the phone interface works fine. I feel that the interiors quality has gone down some compared to my 2005 Pilot. Seems to me they are using more plastic or at least lower quality of the trim. Most of my opinions are based on having a 2005 Pilot for 12 years before buying this one. Still enjoy the ride, engine power and quality of everything else.",4

The storage in the dash/console is TERRIBLE! Basically just one giant deep bucket to throw everything into and never to be seen again. I would say this vehicle is a family car, but obviously a male with probably no kids designed the dashboard/storage. The 2 previous models of the Pilot were much better. A few other complaints... the parking brake foot pedal gets in the way when trying to get a comfortable position on long drives. I never had that issue with my 2007 Pilot. Also, there is really no bumper on this new version, which means you can't reach up on top of the car from standing on the rear bumper if you ever use a roof rack. Not to mention saving the cost of repairs if you ever back into something, you will be smashing your back door along with the non-bumper. Some feedback on the radio, I would have loved to still have had some buttons for controls along with the touch screen. The touch screen is not very user friendly, and I consider myself a tech-savvy person. I was so excited to buy my new Pilot after reading so many great reviews, and it wasn't until I started driving it I feel there are so many let downs on this new design. I'm keeping my fingers crossed they will listen to their customers and make the design better in the future.",4

Safety features are great, but sensitivity of lane keep assist and auto braking can be overly sensitive. It sometimes go off when no other cars are in sight. I've had to have both systems reset multiple times.  I have also had 2 major water leaks as a result of factory deficiencies which resulted in the pilot being in for repairs for 4+ days each time, and it took multiple trips to diagnose the issue. The interior rugs had to be changed due to the potential for mold related to the leaks. Comfort and convenience remain great . Overall I love this vehicle but Honda needs to work on these issues.",4

The good- this thing rides and drives like something costing 3 times as much, interior is well thought out, styling is outstanding, Very easy to get in and out of, the NA 3.5 engine seems to have pretty good power for what it is.

We have leased for 9 months, and are overall very happy with the vehicle. We do not use sync. bluetooth etc, so cant comment on them. Very roomy, especially compared to our 2018 escape. Handles great in winter. Never even needed 4wd last Michigan winter. Drives through a foot or less of snow with ease. Wife is 5ft, I am 6ft 1, and it is easy to drive and adjust seats and mirrors for both of us. Mileage is about 21-22 overall, which was better than I expected. Only real complaint is the smart(DUMB) key/pushbutton start. This key is constantly either locking or unlocking vehicle when you don't want it to. There is a very real danger of walking away thinking the vehicle is locked, and its not. If you stand too long by vehicle or walk around, the vehicle will unlock without you knowing. You are NOT supposed to use the lock button on the key to lock your vehicle, as there have been numerous warnings about scanners that can steal your code. You should only use the lock button on your door. Whatever you do, dont check to see if its locked by checking the handle. This also includes walking up to vehicle with keys in pocket or purse, and expecting it to unlock and it doesn't. You will wake up neighbors a block away, as horn blasts and lights flash. The smart key does not have an ignition interlock, which allows the vehicle to be turned off in any gear, and I've heard of vehicles rolling down driveways, hills etc-a serious safety issue. Also. should you have issue finding the key, fell on floor, purse tipped over etc and you try leaving, panic alarm will sound until you find it. If it was in the ignition like it has ALWAYS been, this wouldn't be an issue. Somehow key wound up under seat, and took 10 minutes to find with panic alarm going. Would your neighbors appreciate this? FORD..........this is a great vehicle. Don't ruin it with pushbutton start/ smartkeys",5

Wish there was more room for left foot while driving (I am 6'4'') and that it had full automatic braking for collision avoidance. Mileage combined is a bit disappointing but the it has terrific acceleration from the 365 hp engine. Interior leather is very well done and it has performed well in snow. Very versatile.",5

Cheap foreign tires for a $48K SUV which require constant, under warranty, rebalancing so they're wasting money on labor not putting good tires on them. It has developed a vibration that the dealer can't find so they say it doesn't have one so can't trust it for long trips. Fuel economy is 18 with 90% highway driving and fuel tank is too small. Tailgate sensor is way too fussy and will open when you don't want it to (got pinned between tailgate and garage door just walking by). Fuse box is impossible to access. Back up camera is necessary because it's difficult to back up looking thru the rear window. It is quick but the torque steer on acceleration will take some getting used to as it will take you into the other lane. It's front wheel drive 95% of the time. It lights up like a Christmas tree every time you get into it or out of it so you'll alert the neighbors every time you come or go, free Ford advertising. Electrically activated rear seats can be accidentally activated by a curious or excited dog or child. I should have rented one for a week or so before even thinking of buying but emotion got the better of me and now I'm stuck. Like most reviews on the net I don't understand all the positive ones.",3

I didn’t want to find myself in a vehicle I wasn’t happy with AGAIN. I like to have either AWD or 4WD, but all of the luxury items you would find in a BMW. I traded in a 2015 Ford Edge AWD loaded, for the Ford Explorer Sport. This was the best decision I have ever made! It’s a very attractive looking vehicle inside and out! It’s fast off the line, and you don’t feel like you are riding on the ground because it’s so low especially in the 4WD. The sync 3 is a huge upgrade and way faster than sync 2. The Sony media system, front and rear cameras are amazing. The heated/ cooled seats, and heated steering wheel is also AMAZING! It rides very very nice on the road. My ONLY complaint is the fuel mileage on the 3.5 eco boost turbo isn’t what I thought it would be. That is my ONLY complaint. The interior leather seats and power third row with auto lift gate options are a must. Just wave your foot under the lift gate and it opens as long as you have your key fab with you. I absolutely LOVE this SUV so far. The turn button intelligent 4WD is awesome, you have 4 different terrain settings. We did pay a pretty penny for it, but with 0% and cash back bonus you can’t go wrong. Very glad I waited and found the EXACT one I wanted with all the options I wanted.",5

In fact, It was often impossible to connect a modern Android phone (Galaxy 7, and Note 5) at times. The controls are unintuitive and hard to figure out compared to the Honda. Also had a lot of trouble with the rear 3rd row seats, on the final day of rental, they simply would not retract. Had to force them manually. On the PLUS side, I like the A/C seats, and the seats retracting when the door opens. The fact that the passenger seat has the same controls and settings as the driver is a plus - my 2008 Expedition does not, and the passenger is uncomfortable. Ford really needs to review the usage and user controls - they are awful.",2

I found this 2017 Limited with 1950 miles on it and saved a nice chunk of change. What was Important to me? 4 or all wheel drive, the ability to tow a 3400 pound boat/trailer and some cargo room. 95% of the time it’s just me driving this vehicle. I drove a 2002 Town Car for the last 11 years as a daily driver, so the Explorer was a pretty radical change. The tech is impressive for me, the infotainment package does all I need and more and Car Play is great, texting is an option now for me while driving, since I don’t have to take my eyes off the road. Comfort is fairly good for me and my 6’7” frame. I agree there could more more left leg room, it has plenty of head room, but I find the center console isn’t diggging into my right leg like the Buick, and thank you power pedals and power telescoping steering wheel!! After 3 hours in the Buick I have to get out and move around. The Buick does have better seats in my opinion especially the headrests, you can truly rest your head. But the Explorer truly wins with the dash design and instrumentation, the Buick is dated in all regards there. Rear seats? They are nice (heated!) but the bench does not adjust back and forth on the larger half, too bad. Passengers are not my full concern most the time but the few that rode back there said it was fine. I’d say taller than 6’2” would be an issue, as I can fit back there but the person in the front would have to be less than 6’.  The Buick and the rear buckets have more leg room for sure, I fit in them just fine. I do enjoy the power fold rear seats for convenience and the trunk well that is there for groceries etc. And the hands free lift gate opening is a blessing as well. The Buick wins for total cargo space and third row comfort but lacks the options and configurations as the Ford. Performance wise both vehicles are similar from the engine and transmissions, though the Buick may shift slightly smoother. Gas mileage similar too with both being AWD models. The Ford has a bit tighter feeling in the steering department. I do love the brakes on the Ford so far! The Buick has a smoother ride in the front row by a little bit but the second row on that vehicle, it’s hard to read the newspaper and it gets real bouncy. I’ve yet to see snow in this vehicle and am anxiously awaiting to test out the AWD system. Heck driving a RWD Lincoln for 11 years had some white knuckle moments but I was very used to it in the snow and did fine, but this should be a major improvement. Bottom line I like my Ford, I like the styling and overall so far it is a nice vehicle and get many complements. I almost bought a Buick but since like 5 people in my family have them, I really didn’t want to be the 6th, LOL. And the styling and interior was getting old and tired to me (I know they have a new 2018 model coming). So many choices out there for sure and I drove them all. This was the best combo of space, size and utility for me.",4
1772, on 11/10/17 21:01 PM (PST),E in Arizona ,2017 Ford Explorer  Limited 4dr SUV (2.3L 4cyl Turbo 6A),2017 Limited Explorer," We bought our 2017 Explorer to replace our 2014 Escape.  We loved the features of the Escape, but found we had downsized too far.   We bought the lLmited, so it has pretty much every extra except the tow package.   So, far we have not had any maintenance issues.  It doesn't have the blinds spot indicators in the mirror like I was used to, but after driving it for a couple of weeks I didn't miss them.  The Explorer has little mirrors located on the  side mirrors that allows me to see everything.  The front seats have amazing adjusting capabilities.   The seats adjust, the foot pedals, and the steering wheel.  It doesn't matter if I am wearing heels or not, I can always find the perfect spot, which isn't easy being 5' tall.   My husband is 6' tall, with a fairly big build and he is also finds the seats comfortable.  So, it has all the extras and they work really nice.   Now for the weird thing.  You cannot turn of the interior lights when you are getting in and out of the vehicle.  There is no switch, so it doesn't matter if the baby is asleep, or you've been driving for a while in the dark and don't want to get blinded by the light, or if like me work nights in an area that isn't great, all the bright interior lights will shine.  The back has a good amount of cargo space, but since I don't think most of us are buying this vehicle for the aerodynamic styling so I don't understand why they took that little chunk out of the back.",5

We were in the market to replace our 06 Expedition, as we no longer need a land bus with 2 young teen children.  We got the Sport because we preferred the more engaged ride over the Platinum. 2nd Row bucket seats (with console) for separation of the kids, like a line in the sand but also when we are out with adults it feels more classy then a bench seat.  Power is great but it is thirsty when you get the turbos spinning.  We have yet to do a long term road trip but our combined city/hwy is 18-19 MPG which is a few ticks higher than our Expedition (14-16) which may be disappointing to some but we are indifferent as our use may not reflect that of others.  As the driver you will find a comfortable position and the technology is a quick learn, intuitive and responsive.  Cabin quality and materials are consistent throughout the vehicle, feeling well built, throughout and much better than my buddys A5.  Rear seats are comfortable for adults and offer plenty of support but may feel tighter for those over 6 feet.  The only real complaints I have are the thicker A-pillar and rear quarters making vision a bit tricky at times.  The distance between the front door and seats make the door armrest virtually useless, which then adds a bit of a slide step to get in and out.  The wife has felt a few awkward shifts (not clunky) but she is unsure if it was situational related to traffic or unfamiliarity to the new vehicle. Front row storage could be adjusted for a spot to put the key FOB and phone without relying on the compartment in front of the gear selector or the cup holder.  As for the 3rd row.. we will *never use it*, I have been there and space is limited but will not violate the Geneva convention.  I cannot speak for quality or reliability as our time with the vehicle does not reflect long term use.  Overall we are happy with our purchase, we did the research on the segment that would work best for our family.",5

It's very comfortable, fast and super fun to drive, handles like you would expect an AWD vehicle to do, no slip and slide on wet roads.  I kind of purchased this 2017 Explorer Sport by misfortune of Hurricane Harvey where my 2016 Ford Escape drowned and was a total loss, recommend always by GAP for a few hundred dollars; which I always purchase but never had to use till now. My loaner car was a Ford Explorer and I really loved it, so off I went to McRee Ford, Dickinson, Texas; where the dealership was practically under water during Harvey.  Mc Ree Ford has an excellent reputation and we have purchased several vehicles from them in the past and even during the chaos the Sales Manager made me a deal I accepted.  Jeff Kuhl, salesman was exceptional, he understood my need and distress from the storm which devastated the Houston and surrounding area, and worked on getting me the best deal utilizing available incentives...  Jeff's knowledge and explanation of how this Ford Explorer Sport operates was outstanding! The only negative with this model is no pull cargo cover like my Escape had, this cargo cover is stationary, but better than nothing.  I drive in the dark mornings and the headlights provides exceptional vision on low and high beam.  I love the space and easy push of a button to fold the rear seats... Security setting where I get in or out and only driver's door is unlocked.  Many excellent safety features included, back up camera and hands free Bluetooth is a must have.  The sunroof is a nice extra bonus and the foot control to open the hatch when your hands are full is nice as well.",5

But I can tell you individually this vehicle isn't the Best in any one single category. However, when you combine all of this vehicle's attributes together for the price Ford asks this becomes the best deal and value around. I compared 27 different vehicles to this one, The main line companies (Honda, Nissan, Dodge, Chevrolet, Mazda, etc) all had vehicles that rounded out to the same price and features, but none of them had the performance to match the Ford. The speciality guys (BMW, Audi, MB, Porsche, etc) could match the performance and the luxury but they were several thousand, and in a lot of cases tens of thousands more expensive. The build quality is excellent with good materials choice and they make it appealing to look at when you get in. Everyone I've put inside the Explorer has said ""I'm surprised how nice it is in here"" and ""Wow this thing moves!"" and ""It's so quiet!"". It was developed side-by-side with the Range Rover Sport and it even had the same designer (that's why it looks so much like it). There are only Ford parts so it's very reliable, unlike the Range Rover. They did some very nice touches  to the car like the aluminum volume knob, the driver and passenger double paned windows coupled with the Acoustic Sound Shield front window. The Nappa Black leather with Red contrast stitching and the black headliner is something you don't usually see as standard equipment. Lets not forget the extremely capable 3.5L V-6 with 365hp standard all wheel drive 0-60mph comes and goes in just 5.8 seconds and you also get the sport suspension design and setup from the Rangerover Sport and magnetic dampers and shocks.

However, at this level, and with several option packages loaded on top of the XLT model, it can be some of the non-critical factors that adversely affect the rating. The packages included Technology, leather seats, and a few other add ons. It is a great road car for freeway driving. I like the radar that warns of crossing traffic when backing into street.  I like the looks, and I have been a fan of Ford Trucks and SUV's for a long time.So here's what I don't like:    A bit ponderous and big-feeling for a 9 foot wide single garage door - I felt more at ease entering the garage with my Ford Expedition and Chevy Suburban.  The foot-kick sensor to open the tailgate functions eractically, making it pretty annoying if not useless. Plus, when I walk behind the rear when the vehicle is parked in the garage, but at least 12 inches away and in now way kicking or swinging a leg towards or under the bumper, the tailgate periodically beeps its warning and starts to open - if not for the beep it would engage the still-closed garage door, but with the beep I can lean on the rising tailgate and force it to reverse itself and close. The touch screen controls too many functions, less than ideally intuitive: talk about distracted driving when trying to figure out to modify a setting, particularly one not used frequently. So I recommend reviewing/setting all the touch screen controls you are likely to use during a trip moving out of ""Park.""",3
1789, on 06/25/17 07:00 AM (PDT),AB ,2017 Ford Explorer  Sport 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl Turbo 6A),Front seats are horrible.," I am surprised that Ford offers front seats that are very very uncomfortable. They are short and narrow and they do not hold your body (I am 5'8, normal weight).  During my first test drive I was moving my body around trying to find a sweet spot - I did not find it. Sales person was very helpful in adjusting the seat but we both failed to make it comfortable. I made two more test drives specifically trying to figure out where the problem is. Made some research and it looks like this is a design flaw. By the way Ford is very proud of its seats. The company recently reduced the number of unique designs and ended up with a generic design that ""fits"" all. Ford is trying to convince buyers that these seats are the best in the industry. My body says a different story. I planned to buy Explorer Sport for longer trips. I feel sorry that a great car has something that cannot be fixed. I switched my attention to Toyota Highlander - a step down in terms of performance but two steps up in terms of a seat comfort. My advice to Ford - if you cannot do it yourself - just replicate others. Highlander 2017 has an expandable front seats that could be extended in length by almost 2 inches. What a great feature plus seats are very comfortable. Love them. Here is an article posted by Ford about the chair architecture. It is funny that Ford thinks that they can use the same chairs in Focus and F-150 and all other models in between. They use the right words when they describe Ford's chairs but they do not deliver what they promised. I found the name of the guy who is behind new seats design - thank you Dan Ferretti. You spoiled my fun and I did not bring my money to Ford. Ford should let Dan Ferretti who is Ford's global seats senior technical leader and his team go. [HTML removed]",1

I purchase high end models, and technology is a must. I consider myself a very experienced car buyer and have been doing this for over 35 years! Had a new fully loaded Volvo XC90 (2016) a CT6 Cadillac Luxury (2017) and now, a 2017 Platinum Explorer. Hated getting in and out of the Caddy. The Volvo was OK, and the Explorer is great. Plenty of power and zip with the turbo V6 which is standard. Technology is pretty easy once you remember where to find the buttons, and the navigation is superb. Volvo was way too complicated, Caddy was OK, but not as easy and intuitive as the Ford. The Ford's voice commands could use some help, but tapping on the keyboard is the solution. Platinum has every bell and whistle, but I do have a few minor complaints: when using the navi and being on the phone, I prefer a voiceover for directions, not a beep. I like to her the next instruction. When changing lanes, I like a beep option, not just a vibrating steering wheel. I would also prefer a button to shut the auto water sensing  windshield wipers when using a car wash rather than having to go through a series of menu's from the steering wheel controls. Other little things such as it needs a more solid noise when closing doors. It sounds a bit tinny. The gas mileage (although mine is very new) has yet to hit 17 mpg either city, highway or combined but I didn't get this vehicle for the mileage performance. The rear seat could have a little more room, and as far as I am concerned, the third row could be an optional feature. If I really want to get picky, the concert stereo system in the Volvo was an upgrade and amazing. The Platinum has a Sony, but it lacks the depth and quality of a high end system. You won't be disappointed with this vehicle!",5
1791, on 05/28/17 07:34 AM (PDT),Rob S ,2017 Ford Explorer  Platinum 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl Turbo 6A),"A poor effort in this class, avoid...."," I leased this car based on a significant discount Ford offered to move from another brand. I cannot wait for the lease to expire as the car finds new ways to disappoint on a regular basis. After 13,500 miles of driving I have dealt with the quirks of a SUV that really isn't. Today, I went to rent a carpet cleaner I have rented in the past and was able to put in the back of my previous mid-sized SUV. Would not fit in this one, the 3rd seat takes up a lot of floor space. So, I called U-Haul. They don't rent to people with a Ford Explorer. The Eco-boost/trailer package isn't all that useful since I cannot rent or use a trailer now from a rental. The transmission has a mind of it's own. It slips in to S1 from time to time on it's own, which acts like a brake so I am used to this quirk as it has happened 4 or 5 times when accelerating from a traffic light or stop sign. I average around 21.7 MPG so I don't drive this hard at all. The electronics have now reset itself 4 times... so everything says it's resetting itself, all the settings are lost then about an hour later everything comes back online. The car also has a really unique feature I have experienced 3 times now. Making a turn in to a busy road, the Eco-boost will bog down, so after the turn has been completed and I need the vehicle to accelerate up to the speed of traffic, the car just kind of sputters and from what I have read this is an issue of the Eco-Boost having moisture or something. Regardless, I don't trust this thing and often wait out traffic knowing that if I turn it may bog down and result in an accident or worse.  As to the vehicle... the premium seats really are not that great, I am over 6'2"" and these are decent seats for someone who is maybe 5'5"". The fancy massage seating loses it's usefulness when I would really have another 2 -3 inches of seat length... so Ford must have a bunch of short people designing their seats as this seems to be a common compliant. The car should have an 8 or 9 speed instead of a 6 speed. The previous SUV had one that came out in 2013 and yet Ford still lags behind. Trying to find the heat/blower settings can take up to 2-5 minutes as I don't like to take my eyes off the road to figure something out that we all took for granted in cars before all this technology. Yes, the car looks a bit like the Land Rover however it's just not a very good offering and Ford should be embarrassed for putting this product out. I am counting down the months until my lease is up and I am already looking at the MDX and offerings from GM. One final note, Ford must know it's a loser as I have been contact ZERO times about my owner experience. The dealership have been great people and I wish they sold another brand as this is the last Ford. I have a family member that drives a new Lincoln every two years and I have already told them no more Ford. The car is a mediocre effort for a mid $40K vehicle... unfortunately it stickers at $55K and it's way out of it's class for that amount.",1
1792, on 05/23/17 12:59 PM (PDT),TC ,2017 Ford Explorer  Platinum 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl Turbo 6A),This is NOT your father's Explorer!!," The Ford Explorer Platinum is without a doubt the best value in the near luxury/luxury SUV market.   I tried--HARD--to not buy this car as I had one previously and just wanted something different, despite the Explorer driving like a luxury car and not an SUV.  Well...all that effort and I finally traded in my old Explorer Sport for a.... Explorer Platinum!   Why?  As before, this is the fastest SUV in it's price class.  I had a Hemi V8 Jeep...and this V6 runs circles around that big V8.   Second, the upgrade in quality materials in amazing.   Third, the new Sync3 is finally what I wanted in a system--something naturally intuitive that doesn't require you to speak 100 words and decide among 6 lines while driving to find the right address.  This couldn't be simpler and more convenient.   Lastly, the included options with the Platinum got the GLE and the X5 I was pricing to over 20,000 more than this car (and for a lot less space...and still a slower car!).   I honestly tried to go a different route, but the quality of the car, the intoxicating power of the engine and the overwhelming included options in this model just wouldn't allow it to happen.    If you're in the market for a luxury SUV, you owe it to yourself to check out the Explorer Platinum....but beware-- you'll run into the same dilemma I did and just may end driving out with it!",5

While I have only had this vehicle for less than a week.  I am thoroughly impressed.  I have 'NEVER' owned a Ford.  I did not buy top of the line and I have not purchased a new vehicle in 20+ years.  I always buy used.  I was looking at three SUVs (4 Runner, Honda Pilot and Ford Explorer) and I found the features, price offering, technology, ford incentives excellent and the warranty was one of the reasons I decided to buy this.  I have a 20 yr/200k mile powertrain warranty (that is anything that touches oil).  I was initially hesitant about considering the inline 4 cylinder engine with ecoboost.  I test drove it and loved it; I went home to research the I4 w/ecoboost needless to say I was not disappointed.  I was surprisingly impressed with the gas mileage and the 310 horsepower.  The 6 cylinder is 255 horsepower. I am getting bout 20/mpg in the city.  WHAT!!!  Do keep in mind I rented an explorer to drive from Jacksonville to Tallahassee in a bad storm, this vehicle handled very well.  My explorer is Blue Jeans Metallic with tan leather, sync, navigation, touchscreen technology, halo lights, foot activated lift gate, convenient dash controls, auto start is great, auto wipers, great steering controls and so much more!  The vehicle is well equipped, rides nicely, grabs the road and the cabin is super quiet compared to my 2012 Honda Odyssey.  My husband is not into SUVs but he was impressed when he drove it, he said it feels more like a luxury car. The mahoney sticker was about $40.5k, after rebates the vehicle was $33,760.  The final thing that ultimately sealed the deal for me was the 20yr/200K mile warranty.  FORD-I'm impressed!!!!!",5

The ride is a world better, the human factors engineering is far better and the controls fit me naturally. At 6'6"" I was concerned about headroom and shoulder room, but the Explorer comes through in spades. The ride is almost as good as my Lexus LS460 which was my favorite car ever. Despite the Cadillac dealer trying to always convince me that the Escalades shortcomings didn't matter, they mattered to me. After blowing out all 4 shocks of my 18-month old Escalade without hitting anything major. Dealer agreed they've had a lot of suspension problems. Sorry Cadillac, 3rd strike, you're out.

The ride is amazing as well.  There is virtually no cabin noise, even at speed in excess of 70 mph on the highway.  Parking this beast is a bit tedious.  It does feel larger than it actually is, but the external sensors and radar gadgets make parking and maneuvering easy over time.  The comfort and luxury of the cabin rivals that of much higher end SUVs.  This cabin has it all; heating, cooling, massage, dual zone, memory seating, etc...   The ride and driving experience is great.  One big downer.. SYNC 3.  It still misses on seamless integration and reliable operation.  It seems clunky and at times, unresponsive.

With the incentives offered by Ford and decent internet pricing, we got into a new model with many options that brought our vehicle within reach of the higher-end Limited series for convenience and features that we wanted, but at a manageable cost. Fit and finish both outside and in the cabin is well executed and we were pleased to find one locally with a light tan leather interior matched to a silver body. We do not like all black inside, it's just too gloomy in my opinion. We especially enjoy the heated steering wheel, lighting and displays and the touch screen functionality. Also, the fold flat cargo floor is a huge deal as we frequently haul goodies to and from the cabin. On the downside, the front driver and passenger seats feel shallow, too narrow for a full framed body. Somewhat hard at first, but they get better with use. There is a concern for long-legged drivers as the seat does not go back far and your feet feel compressed into a space that does not permit much shifting of your extremities. In summary, though, we are happy with our purchase. Our ownership experience has improved since we have had the Explorer but would still like to see the level of driver comfort improved in future.",4

Pros: sync 3 is like an iphone and very responsive, good headlights, upgraded brakes as part of limited upgraded worked well, good grip on road though i drove in dry conditions.  Cons: the interior surfaces scratched easily but perhaps thst is due to soft plastics?, the upper dash is soft but where you right leg hits dash is hard which is bad for a tall guy, acceleration with the base eco boost is bad especially for freeway merge, fuel economy at best was 16.5 mpg which is well below EPA, parking brake hits your left foot.

1814, on 02/22/18 08:28 AM (PST),Scott R. ,2016 Toyota Highlander  Limited Platinum 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Not a Lexus," I purchased the Highlander Platinum to replace my aging Lexus RX300 with extremely low mileage and almost no technology.  I need to pull an enclosed trailer and the Lexus was only rated for 2000 lbs.  I looked at everything available that could tow 5000 lbs and watched literally hundreds of video reviews.  I've had trucks and I've resolved myself to the fact that I'm an SUV guy.  I narrowed my search to the Mercedes ML and GLE, BMW X5, and the Highlander.  I really like the Mercedes but reliability and high maintenance cost were are a major issue.  With the only dealer around 40 minutes away, this would be a problem.   Same goes for the BMW, very nice but high cost of maintenance and dealer location.  Rear passenger entry for both the MB and BMW are difficult for adult men with feet larger than size 8.  I wear a size 12 and they were both ridiculously difficult to get in and out of the back seat.  On to the Highlander.  On paper it ticked all the boxes; towing capacity, reliability, comfortable for 4 adults and their golf bags laid down sideways.  I purchased the loaded Platinum with what I think is every option available.  The good:  Nice looking, visibility is very good.  seats have heat, cooling and a lot of adjustment.  Rear has heated seats and temperature controls along with a nice panoramic sunroof, and pull up privacy screens on the windows.  Leg room is the best I've seen in any vehicle in its class.  On to the not so good:  Gas mileage is pretty dismal around town which is most of my driving.  I'm not lead footed and I get around 15 mpg.  Steering load seems opposite of what it should be, very light at high speed and as you brake / turn at lower speeds it gets heavier.  The infotainment system is just horrible.  The angle of the screen is not driver centric but sky sentric.  During the day it's nearly impossible to read.  This is compounded by the matt finish on the touch surface and terrible contrast.  The knob controls are completely out of reach.  I'm 6 foot and to reach the top right knob, I'm leaning nearly into the passenger's seat.  I'm also getting errors from the parking assist sensors so electronics reliability is in question as well.  This top-of-the-line model doesn't have LED headlamps!  My 2001 RX had self leveling xenons that were awesome.  The Highlander does have auto high-beams which actually work very well.  Closing the front door has a tinny thunk to it that sounds terrible.  My 1999 Wrangler has a more solid sound.  The soft touch surface of the interior door handle is a little too soft.  Like holding hands with a 90 year old lady.  It's an odd feeling.  All in all it's a solid vehicle and meets my needs but time will tell how long I hold onto it.  Experiencing a little buyer's remorse at the moment.",3

It's the second one I have purchased. However...The navigation system in the 2006 was poor and I would have to say the 2016 is worse! The mapping system is one of the most convoluted systems I have every used. The voice system only has one response ""I'am sorry can you repeat that."" We use our cell phone and Google maps because entering your destination is almost impossible using the voice system. The number of commands the system responds to is very limited and you have to say the command exactly right. Now the safety systems are great, and ride is comfortable. I just can't get over what a miserable navigation system this car has. Also it will not interface with Apple Car Play or Android drive  and I am told almost all other cars do.",4

Having leased many Toyota's for over 19 years, we believe we may be qualified for a non biased review. We previously had leased a 2013 Highlander before leasing this one. This 2016 has a smaller interior space that's noticeable right away. The seats as most Toyota vehicles are lacking the much needed foam for support. Adjusting the seating position is also a fruitless effort as you will never be able to find a good compromise. We can't stress enough how poorly constructed any of the Toyota seats are. It seems no matter what Toyota vehicle we lease the brakes are the weakest link. With less than 22k we had to have all the rotors and pads replaced - fully covered under warranty as defective. We would say the overall ride is acceptable but not terrific for its class. From the very start, we had exhaust leaking into the cabin without reasonable explanation. Had it checked out three times and the solution was to attach a chrome exhaust tip, which still doesn't completely resolve to our satisfaction. We don't dare leave the vehicle idling with occupants during cold winter weather. For overall positive points: Improved looks inside and out. Toyota reliability. Better paint than the 2013. Much improved handling. Contrary to another reviewer, the a/c is definitely very cold.",3
1820, on 05/31/17 15:50 PM (PDT),Billy Day ,2016 Toyota Highlander  Limited 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),First Toyota but may be my last," I bought my Toyota Highlander in Jan 2016 New, but it is a 2015 model year.  The Car has excellent performance and power , in fact, it almost has too much for a front wheel drive car.   However,  when getting in traffic I have pushed the accelerator slightly then let up and quickly push again but the engine computer seems to be confused and does not respond as it should.   I have talked with Toyota, but they tell me it is all in my mind as they don't see anything wrong.  This of course, annoys me but I guess it is typical of many service departments, since they are taught to say these things so they can avoid warranty issues.  The steering is nice,firm, and stable.  The interior is very roomy and informative with an attractive dash, etc.  Seats are comfortable especially around town, but on long drives (300 mi)  they tend to get hard and stiff.    I have noticed  too much wind noise above 60 mph, and this is a big disappointment to me because of Toyota's reputation.   The Toyota infotainment is impressive at first, but it become difficult to use the Apps while driving and it seems to have way too many steps to go through just to get what you are looking for. The Navigation is not always accurate or easy to use, so I tend to use google on my I phone and I rarely use the Toyota Nav any longer.    The infotainment  voice command is difficult and slow, plus it is annoying to use as it  makes you wait for a beep sound before you can speak and many times I will talk over the computer and it will not understand what I want.   It would be great if  they could fix the long delay in the voice command for sure.  Overall, the Highlander is a roomy car inside, but the third row seats are really only for small children.  I bought this car because of Toyota's reputation for quality  but the above negatives have caused me to question all of the quality I was expecting.  In fact, at this point I am not sure I will be buying another Toyota Highlander. I have recently driven the New Mazda CX-9  and it seems to really  be nice and it offers much more value, interior quality,  and it is a very  good looking car as well.

Green ,2016 Toyota Highlander  Limited Platinum 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Not worth the cost.," Purchased the 2016 Toyota Highlander Limited Platinum using reviews and owners feedback and own test drive. Have owned for one year and have been very disappointed from the beginning. Rented a Toyota Highlander XLE because no Limited available to rent. Test drove it for about 2 hours over all different types freeway and road conditions except wet pavement. The vehicle was a excellent ride, quite and refined and engine noise and acceleration very good. However we could not test drive a Limited Platinum as we purchased. What a difference in autos. The Limited platinum rides rough and potholes and even small bumps in the pavement can be felt. The wind noise at normal speeds is very loud and at freeway speeds one cannot hold a conversation with another person. I tried to locate the source of the noise and taped up everything in the end but only slightly reduced the noise. The Dealer did find the source which is the rubber seal where the roof and roof rack meet. There is a gap in the seal that is the source of almost all the wind noise. The dealer has no fix and ask me to let them know if I was able to find a solution. I have taken it to two body shops and ask if they could correct the problem. The body shops will not even take on the repair so I am stuck with coming up with a solution of my own. I have tried different things but have not found a solution yet that will stay in place because all of what I have tried will only adhere to either the rubber seal or the metal but not both.  Disappointing because I have owned 6 different 4-Runners and the last three all road and drove as well as the Highlander without the road noise.Since the last review I have corrected the wind noise to being tolerable but its still there. I use epoxy to cover the gap between the windshield and roof rack which looks tacky but it at least helps.  The ride is still rough and I have considered buying new Michelins to replace the Bridgestones it came with. Still not satisfied because the auto was purchased for my wife and she will not drive it because the drivers mirror creates a blind spot for her. So I have an auto I don't like, wife does not like, but to trade it in would be a loss because no one will buy it if the drive it.",3

Took it to the dealership at 5300 miles they compared it to another similar vehicle and said it was the way it was made and that they wouldn't do anything about it. Not only is the problem annoying, the service dept with all its fufu cookies and cream  won't do anything for an actual problem. I bought a foriegn car for too much money to support renewable energy technology and do my part to persuade the US auto industry to become more involved as well. Unfortunately, this foreign company is learning the bad behaviors of US companies and denying the existence of a problem probably because its cheaper for them. I hope others will read this and be encouraged to speak out as well, if we do nothing they will too",3

Very disappointing!," The 2016 Platinum model comes standard with the JBL sound system (with subwoofer). It's not that it doesn't sound good when it's working....but in less than a year of ownership, the subwoofer has blown 3x and now Toyota won't stand behind the product or the warranty. The dealership nor Toyota customer service have not satisfied me as a customer. I can't imagine buying another Toyota product...and I would be leary if I were you.",3
1824, on 02/23/17 13:10 PM (PST),kstanley ,2016 Toyota Highlander  LE 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Highly recommend the Toyota Highlander!," We've had our 2016 Highlander for just under a year now, and we love it. We traded in our 2013 Corolla when we had our first child and we needed something with much more space for all the new things we had to tote around for baby. We researched 4 different brands of cars; Chevrolet, Jeep, Toyota and Ford. The Chevy and Jeep had poor reviews ranging from the Chevy Traverse catching on fire 2 days after having it and the Jeep Grand Cherokee having issues with also catching on fire and having an issue with it's parking brake not holding and rolling away. It came down to the Ford Explorer and Toyota Highlander or 4-Runner. The Ford was slightly less money but after I read the reviews on the Toyota (and being a previous Toyota owner and loved my old car) my husband and I agreed upon one of the Toyotas. There was even a review from a mom who said that she was t-boned by a drunk driver in her Highlander and the vehicle rolled, she and her two children survived and the drunk driver did not. Sealed my thoughts on what I wanted, but we test drove each one anyway. The 4-Runner drove nicely and was spacious, but it felt extremely bulky and top heavy to me. Probably more well suited for someone who wanted to take it off-roading or out in the mountains rather than drive their kids to school and do family things. Next we drove the Highlander and my husband told me that he was very impressed with how sleek it actually looked in person. He said he was expecting something more of a soccer mom van/wagon style and this didn't strike him that way at all. We had our 10 month old son in the car and he instantly fell asleep on the drive in the highlander. The drive was smooth, the interior wasn't as roomy as the 4-Runner but it had a third row seat which we wanted, back up camera, and touch screen audio and blue tooth controls on the wheel. We took this car to San Diego to stay with my inlaws for a few days and my nephew, husband, son, mother in law, father in law and myself all fit in the car comfortably. When we go out of town to San Diego or somewhere around that distance, we only fuel up once for the trip (assuming it's a few days and not a week or so). I drive this car to work every day, and around town, to the neighboring towns about once a week, and I only have to fuel up every other week or so. And now with baby #2 on the way, I have no doubts that this car will be able to continue safely holding all of my precious cargo without making us cramped for space.",5

However, if you are sensitive to noise, you will hate this car.  On my car, a 2017 model, there is a wind intrusion, whistling noise on the passenger side window above 45 MPH; None on the driver's side.  Dealer acknowledged the problem but said that it's a ""normal characteristic"" of the car until Toyota issues a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) on how to fix it.  You can google the internet and see how many other people are having the same problem.  I would not have bought this car had I known about this.  The noise is very annoying and persistent.

1830, on 01/28/17 08:50 AM (PST),pjd ,2016 Toyota Highlander  Limited Platinum 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Cabin Noise is terrible," We set a decibel meter in the the cabin and at 70 mph the 93 db reading requires hearing protection by the federal government.  You get engine noise at low speed and tire noise along with wind noise at speeds higher than 45 mph.  The engine always seems to act as if it is working to keep up at the 55 - 65 mph  and the fuel mileage on two long trips of Interstate in excess of 300 miles has not been above 19.7 miles per gallon, currently only have 4100 miles on auto.   JBL radio speakers are poor and there is not a setting that will pair volume with increased sound so in town at 40 mph your radio volume is set at 12 for volume and on the highway at 70 mph you need to turn the radio up to a setting of 28.  This is my forth Toyota and it will be my last.",2
1831, on 01/28/17 08:48 AM (PST),Jan ,2016 Toyota Highlander  Limited 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Highlander Wins Again," After hours of combing through Consumer Reports, various websites and test driving SUVs, we chose the Toyota Highlander. This is our 2nd Highlander.  It is our main, family of 4, vehicle. We had a base model 2005 Highlander for 12 years & loved it. It was very reliable as we pretty much only had to do routine maintenance. Our 2016, we purchased, was previously a lease vehicle. The safety features are fantastic. The back seat has captain chairs which my 2, 5'10"" tall, teenagers love. The 2nd & 3rd row has more leg room than our previous model. We only use 3rd row seat for short trips. Overall, the 2016 feels roomier than our 2005. I'm not a fan of the plastic cargo cover in the back. I'd rather have carpet to help keep things from sliding around. Also, the storage center between the front seats is awkward/bulky. The tech features are easy figure out & use. The ride feels smoother & is quieter than our previous Highlander. We test drove the 2017 Honda Pilot at least 4 times & liked it too, but the tech had zero knobs & was not as easy as Highlander to figure out. The Pilot seemed to sit lower than the Highlander & the steering felt looser. In the end we purchased the Highlander, because we know it will be reliable for years to come & we wanted a sportier look.*Update after 6 months. Still love our Highlander. However, I wish the automatic hatch would lift higher. I'm 5'5"" & have hit my head on it several times. I do push it higher manually when I remember.",5

I live on the side of a Mountain. The grade going up my drive is probably 60 degree along with a few curves. The car has amazing down hill assist to negotiate down steep hills and of course my drive. AWD and  4 wheel drive additional feature: just tried in the snow on my steep drive and did not slip once. I would highly recommend this car. I had 2  VW Touareg's, but they were not as reliable on the roads I travel as the 2016 Toyota in snow, ice and mountain terrain. The things I do not like about the car: I am 5'4 and getting positioned in the car means I am constantly moving the seat back and forth. When it rains, the configuration of the door and windows does not shed water when door is initially opened,  steering is so fine tuned you don't feel the roughness of the road consequently ---takes a little getting use to...finally... I would like a more realistic back up camera  (not a fish eye camera )- positioned where the rain drops and snow  do not sit on camera lens distorting the backup view. But as far as safety, I will deal with the insignificant to enjoy the significant safety features.  I need Safety first. The 2016 Highlander  is a great value for the money and the safety features sold me 100%.  .. "" NC Mountains""",5
1833, on 01/02/17 09:39 AM (PST),Bill F. ,2016 Toyota Highlander  XLE 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),I would consider other options before purchasing," This is our 5th Toyota and by far our least favorite. The large outside mirrors cause blind spots when turning. The auto climate control seems to overshoot the temperature causing discomfort until the cabin temp has stabilized. We do not experience this on our 2014 Rav4. The navigation system was not accurate the voice command often told us to turn in one direction when the map displayed the opposite.  We found out that the map data was from 2015 on a 2016 vehicle purchased in October of 2016. The dealer wanted to charge us for the update that was released prior to the purchase date. The rear windshield wiper locks up at times after the rear window is opened and closed. (The wiper is driven from a mechanical linkage located in the lower portion of the hatch and often does not re-engage after the window is closed. The brakes are awful, pedal often goes almost to the floor and the dealer says this is normal. They would not even check to see if the brakes needed to be bled as they said this would be admitting there was a problem?????????) The drivers side window makes a loud noise every time it closes. In all the prior Toyota vehicles we have owned starting in 2009 we have never had a complaint until the Highlander. Our 2014 Rav4 is a much better vehicle than the Highlander. Based on the way Toyota and the dealer responded to the issues, we will likely never purchase another Toyota.",3

However, don't believe the 18-24 fuel rating. I just took it on a 250 mile trip, drove conservatively on the highway & averaged a whopping 17.9 MPG.

1836, on 12/22/16 18:59 PM (PST),Disappointed Toyota Owner ,2016 Toyota Highlander  XLE 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Read the Consumer Affairs Complaints Before Buying," I wish I had read the Consumer Affairs complaints before buying my 2016 Toytota Highlander XLE.   I've only owned my car for 30 days and already had an issue with the car starting on its own.  Yes!  That's right.  I walked up to my car after shopping at WalMart for 40 min. only to find that it had started up by itself, and must have been running while I was in the store with the doors locked.  Upon entering the car, a yellow caution light was flashing near the odometer.  I read many consumer complaints and found another person complaining of the same problem and was told that it can happen when the remote entry keypad is pushed twice after exiting the vehicle.  After reading many other customer complaints about various issues with 2013-2015 brakes not working while driving (Yikes!), driver doors not unlocking, and front seats making loud noises while driving, I wish I had read those complaints before purchasing this vehicle.  It sounds like the 2013, 2014, and 2015 may be lemons.  I'm not sure about the 2016 yet, because the car is too new to know for sure, but I'm very concerned about what's to come.  I don't feel 100% safe in this car, especially since I have 2 kids.  This is my 2nd Toyota.  I just sold my 2006 Sienna minivan and it had many defective issues/recalls.  I will not be buying a Toyota in the future because they don't stand behind their cars.  They only try to blame the customer for their defects.UPDATE after 30 days of driving - The sound system is terrible.  My Sienna minivan had a JBL sound system which was great, but the Highlander has a cheap sound system with a horrible muffled sound.  After driving the car a little while, you will notice that the interior has many cheap parts!!  The floor ""carpet"" is actually felt, not carpet, and some of the dash has plastic parts.  The front seats and angled headrest are very uncomfortable on longer rides.  Wish I could trade my new XLE in for a well made car that matches the price I paid.  The quality just isn't in the 2016 Highlander for the high price.   Still disappointed.",1

Just one concerning trait, heard this strange buzzing noise coming from underneath the rear end about 5 hours after it was turned off and parked in the garage. No idea what it was so Googled it; ""This is the sound of a fuel evaporation leakage check and, it does not indicate a malfunction"" was the answer in several searches. Sure enough it is in the Owner's manual as well. Would have been nice if the dealership would have pointed this out when they were explaining the other features at time of purchase.",5
1840, on 12/13/16 08:40 AM (PST),Bud Mudge ,2016 Toyota Highlander  LE 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Miss my Jeep Grand Cherokee.," Although there were things on the Jeep I really like, the Highlander is fine.  The Highlander driver-seat-belt arrangement is difficult to reach when starting a drive.  I miss the handles of the Jeep: they were where the side-air-bags are located in the Highlander so have to use the steering wheel as a ""grab"" on entering.  I prefer the 4wd selector in the Jeep as opposed to the method in the Highlander which essentially is front-wheel-drive with automatic traction transfer to the rear wheels as sensors determine.  Gas mileage of the Highlander V-6 seems to be about the same as the ""in-line-six"" of the Jeep; around 27-28 hwy.  I also miss the gauges of Jeep (oil, etc.) and ""warning lights"" may be just a tad too late.  Had leather seats in the Jeep with seat-warmer; no need for seat warmer with the Highlander's fabric seats.  Dragging myself, kicking and screaming,  into the 21st Century so, I will eventually get used to the Highlander.  In all, it has more bells and whistles than the Jeep and I driving with the manual on my lap at times.",4

Hate that Toyota nickels & dimes you for everything. My only negative review is that the cabin is much louder than I expected on the highway. I came out of a 2007 Toyota Avalon & the difference in the cabin noise is surprising. I would definitely recommend test driving on the highway. Other than that, overall is good. Wish there was a way to have Waze as an app instead of toyotas nav system. It's not as efficient as Waze.   The third row is definitely for kids.

The Highlander hit the spot.   What I most like about this SUV is simple the way it drives.  It's smooth, quiet and comfortable.  It has a very solid feeling on the highway.   Visibility is not the greatest which is typical of any SUV but the blind side monitors are great for lane changing.  I would not have this vehicle without this feature.   The Toyota Entune tech package with NAV, is fantastic and easy to setup and use.    Only a couple of minor complaints with this SUV.  When you open the glove box door it hits the passenger in the legs.  It needs to be raised.   Also I bought the Limited version believing it had most everything I wanted, and I was a little disappointed to discover that it didn't have automatic high beam/dimming.    Other than that, it has about everything my Cadillac DTS has on it.    I looked at 3 other vehicles, the Pathfinder which was a nice vehicle but was a bit noisy, and the new GMC Acadia which was also quite nice but overpriced - about $8,000 more than a comparatively equipped Pathfinder.  Our local dealer, Capital Toyota in Chattanooga was very hospitality and easy to deal with.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a mid sized SUV.",5

The size does make it comfortable for adults, the 2nd row seats have plenty of room even for larger/taller people.  I really enjoy the ""shelf"" located slightly below the dashboard.  It makes a great place to put your phone, glasses, laundry ticket, etc, you get the picture.  It also has a large center console for bigger items.  The onboard tech is OK, the Toyota Entune system has a couple of OK features including notification of txt's and emails - although you cannot read them while driving but you can send a standardized response. You also have apps for Open Table, sports, stocks, movie tickets and a few others.  The stereo, although listed as a premium system is not very powerful and the tone/quality is fair at best.  The NAV is OK to use, the voice activation commands work best for making bluetooth phone calls but using it to NAV or perform other functions is mediocre. The motor sounds fine at most speeds but I do hear a ""whine"" or higher pitched tone from time to time that I do not care for.  Also, the Homelink function is difficult to program.  I have succeeded in getting button 1 programmed but the other buttons are not working.  (I have not contacted Toyota yet on this issue) The pros are the nice size, overall styling and functionality, the cons are a couple of extra noises, avg stereo and mediocre grade leather on the seats. My net opinion, I would buy this car again and would recommend it to you!Updating the review after 6 months ownership;  I was able to get the Homelink programmed.  Interesting it worked when I tried it and was miles from my garage and used a handheld remote and for no apparent reason the programming took!  The car still gets roughly 20 MPG and have had no ""squeaks or rattles"".  I stick with my earlier recommendation and would buy the car again if given a choice.",5

It just didn't seem like the quality was as a good as with the previous body style. The seats were definitely not as comfortable. Also, the hood design creates a hazard when the sun reflects off of it at certain angles. You don't notice it from the outside but when you sit in the front seat you can see there is somewhat of a ""U"" shape design. Well when the sun hits the top of the ""U"" on either side it shines right in your eyes.

The touch screen is easily navigated and home screen keeps all the important and most used apps at your finger tips.  My sons love the heated back seats and the headrest mounted DVD players (dealer installed but not made by Toyota).  I was hoping for more interior room, the MPG is also not great at 19-20 average (and most of my driving is on country roads, not stop and go traffic).  I thought after 8 years Toyota would have done a little better.  Also DO NOT get Toyota installed remote start!  It only works from about 20 feet from the car.  If you are inside and the car is outside forget about it!  It also shuts the engine off when you get in and you need to restart.  But overall, I LOVE my new Highlander!",5

I narrowed it down to the redesigned Honda Pilot and the Toyota Highlander XLE AWD.  I reviewed many customer, and on-line expert reviews, and for me there was no contest... the winner was the Toyota Highlander XLE.  From looks and comfort to performance and safety/technology.  All of my past five SUV's all drove like trucks, but not the Highlander, this one drove like a Lexus!  It is definitely a head turner that I'm proud to drive.  I got the Blizzard White which is not your standard white, it's a more luxurious color for sure.  I'm 6'2' tall and I have plenty of room in the drive seat, which is not the case in a lot of SUV's.  Just to be picky...I wish it had a few more USB ports, and blind side indicators for this model, which is the more popular middle of the road model.  I now have 40,000 miles with no maintenance issues whatsoever. Great vehicle overall, good in snow, and so much fun to drive!

Also...  nice to have a small storage compartment at the bottom left side of the steering wheel.  But, remember to close it before exiting the car... or you will feel it....October 2017 update:  I am still frustrated by the ability of the Highlander to understand my voice commands.  I was wondering if I need to speak Japanese.  Toyota should send everyone an update CD for this PROBLEM.  Like I said before....  all the other cars I have used before work better.  The 3rd Row seat is too small for practical use.  People who need this seat should look for a vehicle with more space.  The transmission is a little finicky.  Drive calmly ... it's fine.

We have had continual bouts with the radio/nav system just completely shutting down (in the middle of a route) and restarting - I mean the radio shuts off! The fact that the nav screen is not recessed or protected results in a glare that make the screen at time unusable. In addition the bluetooth will arbitrarily cut off and not reconnect unless the car is stopped. I have read other reviews and other owners have reported the same problem with the radio and despite 2-3 replacements the radio is still doing the same thing so I'm not sure what our options are. As stated earlier the sun roof is virtually unusable from a noise perspective because when open the wind noise is so significant you can't carry on a conversation.

We start the car via push button and then select Auto Engine Idle disable which shut off the engine at a stop light or when stopped.  I wonder who the bone head designer from Honda was that thought this was a good idea?  Your engine shuts off with car in gear when brake pedal is held longer than x amount of time at a stop.  All fluids/hydraulics that power an auto transmission come to a stop when engine shuts off.  Then when you remove your foot from brake engine starts and away you go, very hard on a transmission resulting in a lot of jerking from a stop, and dumb design.  We had Fischer Honda of Boulder re-map (from Honda factory) the 9 speed transmission shift points and programming of transmission which has corrected all jerky and bad performance of the transmission.  We wish that Honda had a way to permanently disable the stupid Auto Idle from the factory.  Our driving is mixed 50/50 and fuel mpg of this heavy SUV has always been around 22-23mpg.  Road trips are around 21-23 mpg with skis on roof rack or cargo box and about 25 mpg without parasitic drag of roof rack.  Overall loved this SUV and the safety of Honda.  We love the safety of Honda as wife and kids were in head on car crash in our first Pilot when F150 lost control and crossed traffic.  Everyone walked away and our trusted pilot was destroyed as it did its job protecting the family.  The fire department and police could not believe and were impressed at how well crash ended.  We also love Fischer Honda of Boulder, it is a 30 min drive each way to dealer from our residence, but wife will not take it anywhere else for maintenance (when I'm out of town) or repairs under warranty.   Hope this helps and demand that Honda re-program the transmission if  your having same issues as we did.",4

If it was not for my Honda Pilot's durability and air bags, I don't know if I would be alive or extremely injured. I walked away with a broken arm and sprained ankle and some bruises. I truly believe this car saved my life. Unfortunately my Pilot is totaled, however you couldn't tell by looking at it, but I intend on buying another one. Thank you Honda for making a great car !",5
1899, on 11/03/17 11:53 AM (PDT),RobH ,2016 Honda Pilot  Touring w/Navigation and Rear Entertainment System 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Seemed like a good idea," LA little over a year ago we sought to replace our 2007 Toyota Sequoia.  With three growing children, we needed a larger SUV and wanted something more fuel efficient than the Sequoia. The 2016 Pilot seemed like a great choice with a fair amount of cargo space and really cool features. Thought we were lucky when we were one of the first to own the new Pilot in July 2015 but turns out we were not so lucky after all.The good:Technology galore: state of the art transmission that shuts off at stop lights to save fuel, side mirror camera, back up camera, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warnings, accident collision assistance, multiple USB connections, memory seats (I’m 6’4” and my wife is 5’4”)and a touch screen radio with XM radio that has memory and allows me to pause and replay songs. Oh, and whenever I change the channel, it brings me to the beginning of a song currently being played so I don’t have that feeling of “darn, just missed it!”.  Fantastic highway gas millage with up to 36 mpg on a 120 mile drive into the Poconos and finally, very easy access to the third row for my 8 year old.The bad:Second row space was not as roomy as I thought and my 6’ teenage son constantly put his knees in the backs of the driver or passenger. Lane departure is flat out annoying with the wheel shake while taking a turn a little tight (sorry, I am an aggressive driver).  Fuel door wasn’t flush to the body of the vehicle.  Fingerprints all over the radio screen.  Adaptive cruise control SLAMS on the breaks when it is not necessary and when driving on a winding road and there is an approaching vehicle on the other said of the road, the Pilot detects that we might have a head on collision. Idle stop did not always work and sometime heisted when starting back up at stop lights. The ugly:My wife HATED this vehicle. Too much technology for her and every so often the radio sound “flickers” and the only remedy is to shut the car off completely and restart (terribly annoying). We even had a couple of occasions when the radio/nav screen was completely blank/off. So while the technology seemed exciting, it needs work. Should have known better to buy a new model. Guess we just expected more from Honda. The result:A year later we traded the Pilot in at a loss for a used 2015 Sequoia Limited which I should have done in the first place. Would have saved me $7K but that is how much we disliked the Pilot.  Seeing the transmission problems so many people had, glad we took the loss and moved on.  It is a shame because we pretty much owned at least one Honda since 1996. That streak came to an end 20 years later and not sure if/when Honda will be our choice again.",2
1900, on 10/27/17 13:56 PM (PDT),Jim ,2016 Honda Pilot  Elite w/Navigation and Rear Entertainment System 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),First and Last Honda I will Ever Buy," My wife wanted to trade our Mercedes GL450 for a new 2016 Pilot Elite. She liked the new design and the features on the Elite cannot be matched on similar vehicles. Her parents have had several Honda's. This was our first. Within the first 1ok miles we had several software recalls. One was for the computer adding miles to the odometer when the car was turned off. Not sure how many miles, but they extended the warranty 12k miles. At 16k miles the transmission started chirping between 3rd and 4th gear. I was told it just needed a firmware reflash. I shared information that suggested otherwise, but the dealer refused to listen. Picked it up the next day and asked if it still chirped. The answer was yes, but that I would have to drive it 40 miles for the system to reteach itself. Drove it 60 and took it back the next day with a louder chirp. Shared several pages from previous owners that stated there was a broken part in the transmission that cross contaminated engine coolant with transmission fluid. Shared that with the dealer. He asked what the resolution was and I told him a new transmission. Turns out I was right. Fast forward to 33k miles. Received a letter from Honda stating that our car now needs a new radiator, all new hoses and O rings and they need to test the engine to make sure it was not damaged. This is all from the original transmission issue. While the car was being repaired, I traded it on a 2016 Lexus GX460. I have been a loyal Toyota/Lexus/Scion user for many years and never should have let my wife talk me into this Honda Pilot. First and last Honda I will ever own! BTW, she loves the new Lexus.",1

During the third Regular Maintenance and after several upgrades to take care of the Transmission problems in  previous Regular Maintenance appointments, I was told Honda had ordered the Dealer to keep my vehicle so they could replace the Transmission!  What, I yelled!  It only has 12,000 miles and you have fixed twice before and now you tell me it needs replaced!!!  Disappointment began and went on and on and on.  Told transmission problem was being experienced by others....Given an Accord not an SUV to drive for weeks...told dealer I wanted another new 2016 Honda Pilot Elite manufactured after Transmission problems were known and hopefully corrected...Was told how to contact Honda company.....Which told me how to look at the Owner's manual and appeal their decision to not give me a new one but rather fix the old one....Filed the appeal....The so called reputable board turned me down...and turned down (or did not even see) my second choice of ""you fix it and give me back money I lost by trading wife's older Honda Pilot and my 2013 Honda Civic in to make my wife happy....They was NOT mentioned in the turn down of a new one but they also did not refer to it and I am unsure if they even knew about it!!...They requested I reply and agree to their decision.....I just filed all the paperwork....so sad am I",4
1902, on 10/10/17 09:32 AM (PDT),Jaime ,2016 Honda Pilot  LX 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Electronic Issues," So I purchased my 2016 Honda Pilot in September of 2015. From the start I've had nothing but electronic issues that the dealer won't fix because they claim they can't replicate them.  My stereo does whatever it wants, whenever it wants...usually blasting the music WAY. TOO. LOUD. and you are completely unable to turn it down.  Also, the climate control system changes the settings almost each time I'm in the car...temp changes, recirculate turns on and off on its own, sync turns on and off on its own, etc. My car has also completely shut down in the middle of driving it multiple times. I was told this only happens when going through a deep puddle, which I've not done!  My driver's seat heater works sometimes, while the one for the passenger works fine. I even asked the dealer to keep the car for a week and have someone drive it...the drove it for 15 miles and said there was no issue!!  We bought a Honda because they are known for their reliability and customer support, neither of which we got.  I will never own another Honda product again!!",3
1903, on 09/19/17 14:44 PM (PDT),Miguel ,2016 Honda Pilot  Elite w/Navigation and Rear Entertainment System 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Comfortable touring vehicle," The pilot is a vehicle that will get you to your destination in comfort. It is designed for 7 passengers, but for long trips only 6 people can realistically travel comfortably.The pilot is an SUV, not a sports car. It handles great for what it is the AWD works great in snow and mud. As to the 9 speed transmission, I love it when it works properly and hate it when it feels like I am driving a $200.00 car with a bad transmission, which is the the reason for a 4 instead of 5 star. With this being said, I trust that our Pilot will get us to our destenation safely and we would probably purchase another Honda Pilot again.",4
1904, on 09/05/17 10:49 AM (PDT),Heidi Halverson ,2016 Honda Pilot  Touring w/Navigation and Rear Entertainment System 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Road Trip Ready," I love my new Pilot.  We recently replaced Hyundai Entourage (minivan sim to Odyssey) because it was unreliable.  At first I looked at Odysseys because that was out of our price range 7 years ago, but then I looked at Ford Explorer and Honda Pilot.  We don't need cavernous space of minivan and wanted an SUV for Wisconsin winters.  Space is great for 2 older kids (middle school) and large dog.  The kids gave up captain chairs for bench seat, which is very comfy and spacious.  It is harder to get in third seat without 2nd seat aisle, and I wish rear door opened all the way 90 degrees.  We have a dog blanket on rear bench seat, but can easily take that down, and there is good space back there for 2 humans, even adults. We got Touring package because we didn't want to give up DVD and liked the idea of in-dash navigation.  Navigation is good, a bit slower than my phone but interface is good and it is much easier to see and follow.  This is my first vehicle where I can listen to iTunes with Bluetooth and that works great with iPhone 6S, as do phone calls.  I can transfer contacts and addresses from my phone to my car, but transferring addresses is cumbersome.  I think I can use Siri to navigate with my phone, make calls etc but car just works as speaker, but I am not a Siri lover.  With Touring package we got Honda Sensing which sounded like bells and whistles or beeps and gimmicks.  But I love Honda Sensing I think more than DVD or Nav: Lane Departure Warning is useful, Lane Watch takes some getting used to but makes changing lanes safer, its very similar to the backup camera where you have to get used to looking at the screen and turn and look at mirrors less, but I can see and judge distance better with the camera.  Adaptive Cruise Control is just plain Beautiful.  Love love love it.  Makes highway driving so much more enjoyable.  As for the 9-speed transmission, I like it.  It is smooth and fuel efficient above 20 mph.  Below 20 mph it is weird.  I can tolerate it, but I still find it weird that the car in drive doesn't naturally propel forward, it needs acceleration and gear changes are lurchy.  Also sub 20 mph I tend to let off the gas into a curve and accelerate out.  With this car it really slows down when you let off the gas.  I think it downshifts and slows you down rather than coasts.  There is room for improvement.  And > 20 mph gear shifting is smooth and seamless.  Another feature that I want to like, but seems unnatural is the auto engine shut off.  This happens at stoplights and such.  Brake and engine turns off, let off brake or turn wheel and engine quickly restarts.  It seems like a great idea and works well.  At first my foot wasn't braking hard enough to engage this feature and it gave me a driver notification.  At first it was jarring because you can definitely tell when it restarts when you are driving.  My husband feels like there is a delay when he is pulling out at a corner and wants to drive in an opening.  I have gotten used to it and feel no delay now, but there was a learning curve.  What I don't like is sometimes, like waiting to pick up kids from school, it doesn't stay off, engine restarts and doesn't have to.  Also if I put it in Park the engine restarts.  I find that annoying and pointless, e.g. I drive up driveway into garage, brake, engine shuts off for split second.  Put in Park, engine turns on for split second.  Turn off car, engine turns off.  Just seems wrong.  This car is great for road trips, spacious, comfortable, reliable, safe, and efficient.  It is almost as big as my minivan, mostly just lower in vehicle height and this sits higher off the ground, that make for less cargo space but driveability is so much better.  It feels smaller than it is and much more manageable than the minivan.  When I first drove it home it felt like driving a car again. I liked the Pilot interior more than the Ford Explorer, visibility is better, mileage, safety is better, DVD player is better.  I did pay more than I would have for the Explorer.  Equivalent Explorer was $33k, I offered $29k, they said hell no.  I have bought 3 Fords and never got a deal on any, so I found a Pilot for $42k, asked for their best price and they sold it to me for $38.6k, no hassle, and both gave me the same $2k for crap minivan.  I paid cash and took my new car.  Months later people were out protest the Ford dealership for selling them a lemon.  I'm just saying, no regrets.  Yes I paid more for equivalent features, but I liked the Pilot more and because of resale price it has much better value.  If I bought the Explorer and traded it in the next day I would have lost $33k-$25k=$8k.  With the Pilot I could still get $35k for the trade so I'd be out only out $3k-$4k. Best feature: I love the center console box.  It is large easy access - my purse fits right in.  I leave my purse ""hidden"" in my car.  Much more functional than Explorer and Highlander.  Best unexpected features:  Adaptive Cruise Control & Skylight",4

After a few months of driving it the engine light kept going on and there was a problem with the emition system. The dealer fixed it and told me it was an injector problem.  2 months later the sign came back with the emition system. The dealer said it was the catalytic converter. They cleaned it and said it was okay but after one week the sign had returned. This really changed my mood and I only drove for 50,000 miles so far. I'm wondering as to what should I do but I do not recommend Honda. Hope they do better next time.",1

Very expensive!  But worth it.  We have a number of kids and have thoroughly enjoyed this SUV.  It sits up pretty high, much higher than a minivan (which we have also owned) but drives fairly smoothly and easily.  It has a lot of power but isn't except nimble.  The comfort and minimal road noise are its best qualities.  I have read a number of reviews that complain about the nine speed transmission, but we have found it to work just fine and shift smoothly. The seats are supportive and the interior materials are high quality.  The only drawback is that the space behind the rear sets is small, at least compared to a minivan.  The headlights look great (especially the daytime running LEDs) and the body style is attractive but not overbearing.  I average 25 mph in about 40% city driving and 60% highway driving, which is excellent for this large of a vehicle.  It handles in snow like a dream!  We live on a hill and have had several days where we probably would not have made it home without the pilot AWD.  The rim package on the Touring looks sweet.  Love this car!",5

Then the maintanance lights started popping up (Emissions system problem) at around 20,000 miles.  Catalytic converter was replaced.  Lights came back on like a Christmas tree shortly after.  Fuel injectors were replaced.  Lights back again and this time they said we had bad fuel.  We had a lot of delayed acceleration problems.  The air conditioner started going out.  The dealer always helped us, but they couldn't make the vehicle more reliable. We ended up with 30,000 miles on this vehicle before we sold it and took the loss.  Please research this trim model.",1

We love our's!!!," To begin my review, I don't know what Larry Pines means by hype.  No one should be buying a car because of a ""hype"".  Especially a new car...he sounds like he needs a car that drives like a sedan, sounds like a sedan, and feels like a sedan.  But I think that might be too much of a hype for Larry and family..  Yeah, the plastic is super glossy.  Did you not test drive this thing before you bought it? I put so many fingerprints on the test drive car, I almost felt bad.  Whatever...even satin finish surfaces get fingerprints.  9-speed shift? it's CVT...it ""continuously"" shifts. There's a brochure about it.  It might not be the smoothest shifting transmission, but it's to save a little bit more on gas, right?  anyways, I could go on for what ""could"" be better about the vehicle.  But you know what's so great about it?? It's got room! It's like minivan, but in a SUV body.  You don't want sliding doors and look like you're driving a get-away car? this would be it.  But it IS a get-away car.  I was impressed with the acceleration with econ mode off for how much it weighs.  It's a SUV, not a sports car.  The entertainment system/panoramic sunroof? Definitely a plus! My daughter loves watching Frozen and she doesn't cry.  She likes pointing out birds, and says 'tweet-tweet'.  She ca barely say 'mama or dada' on good days.  Remote start? Awesome.  Auto-idle? yeah it's annoying in bumper-to-bumper.  But you can't tell me it's so hard to press a button that's right next to your finger when you're just cruising down the road...it's probably easier, safer, and quicker than checking texts on your phone.  Jumping battery? meh...if you can afford auto insurance for the Pilot, I'm sure your plan has road-side assistance.  Otherwise, carry a screwdriver in the car.  boom. problem solved.  Horn sounding a bit weak? screw it. high-beams and a finger always work just fine.  How about that auto trunk?! I love it. The range of auto start is definitely a plus.  It starts the heater or A/C depending on temperature.  How cool is that?  You want heated seats? How about cooled seats? Have you checked out Toyota highlander's range on their auto start? not cool... Navigation? My daughter loves that the car on the navi looks like a plane.  It might be clunky, but that review is all over the internet.  Probably should've checked it out if the reviews are saying 'it's clunky'.  I installed running boards.  Yes, please.  Safety features? You can turn them off...the safety features are for people who are distracted anyways...Honda Pilot is not advertised as self-driving car for  crying out loud.  The lane thing is pretty cool.  I love that I can take my hands off the wheel if I wanted to.  But if the car can't see, it lets you know.  I don't ""fight"" anything.  A little nudge here puts the car right back where it was. The vehicle is quiet.  It's a SUV.  It's not meant to be aerodynamic...it's not meant to be the best ride you can have in a vehicle.  The seats are a bit stiff....that I didn't like. The lumbar option doesn't have as much adjustability as my Hyundai Santa Fe.  That might be my only comfort complaint.  Oh the steering wheel controls can be re-done..but how many times are you pressing those things while you drive anyways?You want more dashboard car information?  get yourself a bluetooth OBD reader and download Torque.  Problem solves and you've got whatever information you need/want from your car.  Look, the Honda Pilot isn't for everyone.  If you're good with the EX-L, then great.  If you're good with the Elite, great.  The point is, do your homework and make sure you know what you're getting instead of listening to any ""hypes"".  That's just a terrible way to purchase a vehicle. I'm sure the Highlander has some advantages over the Pilot.  But it doesn't have what I was looking for, so it didn't cut it.  Oh, and try sitting in the 3rd row of the Highlander.",4

In fact I hope you read this, avoid buying the 2016 (or 17) Honda Pilot, and avoid the same mistake our family made.  When my wife and I test drove the 2016 Honda Pilot we were not terribly impressed with its acceleration but that was not why we were looking at a new Honda.  We were looking for something reliable and Honda has had a great track record in that regard.  So, even though we were not over the moon about the Pilot when we test drove it, we thought this is going to last 10+ years and is, therefore, a wise purchase.  Boy, were we wrong!   One problem with the Honda Pilot is the 9 speed transmission.  My 1972 Chevelle shifts smoother than this.  When you drop this Honda in drive first thing in the morning, the first-second gear shift will try to separate a few vertebrae... it is brutal.  Once warmed up, this transmission is better, but still not so good.  Especially in stop and go traffic where you will experience many times where the transmission seems completely out of touch with the throttle, leading to ""rev rev rev... wham!"".  You *will* need a chiropractor if you have to drive in stop and go traffic with this machine.  Also, this transmission has a history of early failure already.  However, that transmission won't be the thing that kills you.  The Honda Sensing system will.  Lets say that you are on a highway going 70 mph when someone going 20 mph slower than you pulls out 3 car lengths in front of you.  In that situation our Honda Pilot will SLAM on the brakes HARD causing anyone behind us to weave desperately into the adjoining lane or shoulder to keep from hitting us in the rear.  Or lets say that you are going around a bend on a country road, the Honda Sensing system gets confused and again SLAMS on the breaks in the middle of hard bend.  Lets say you survive the Honda Sensing system... will you be able to survive the throttle?  Lets say you are in stopped trying to turn left across rapidly moving traffic.  You need your car to move when you step on the gas.  The Honda Pilot will occasionally toss in a 5-7 second delay in response time, just to add to the challenge.  Did I mention the $200 oil changes?  This is because, in our case, about the time we needed to change the oil, the ""B16"" code would be thrown on the info system, indicating that the rear diff also needed to be changed.  This prompted the service manager at our local Honda shop to exclaim, ""what is wrong with these new Pilots?!""",2
1916, on 04/30/17 07:01 AM (PDT),Mark ,2016 Honda Pilot  Touring w/Navigation and Rear Entertainment System 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Piloting our life's journey," We had traded it in their 2012 Honda CRV for a 2015 Honda Pilot and we're traveling through life just fine for a year. Then one day stopping by the Honda dealership there it was the 2016 pilot. Before I knew it I was in talking to my salesman they gave me a fantastic deal on a trade in three and a half months later are 2016 Honda Pilot touring all wheel drive arrived. This vehicle is so much more than the 2015 pilot was. Smooth, quiet, very powerful, and all the options that one could will it. I must say the button shifting was something to get used to but now I'm very accustomed to it and wouldn't go back to a regular manual shifter. I can't say enough about the way the pilot Drives, handles, and once in awhile I must say I am guilty of disappointing kids and their little rocket cars as I ease into the gas pedal and deposit them in my rearview mirror. Handling is great visibility is good and I'm very happy with the vehicle. As we passed 38,200 miles the Pilot has taken us to Orlando and back as well as Mackinac Bridge, Chicago, Ohio, Detroit, and various points of interest, to include daily activities. All completed without a hitch. 30k service was a sticker shock with this fancy German ZF9 tranny accounting for $400.00 of the service bill. The Pilot is still wonderful to drive. Honda sent us a warranty extension on the ZF9 tranny extending it to ten years unlimited miles. We got a second letter requesting we bring the Pilot in for so the can replace the transmission fluid heater which has been failing causing motor and transmission failure. Yikes!!! I hope Honda's new ten speed and the standard ZF9 in all the new Odyssey vans have this shorted out. Love my Pilot, but I ordered a Ridgeline RTL-E in Obsidian blue three months ago. Rides even better than the Pilot, has the good old reliable six speed that only cost $100 to service as well as 18"" tires that are going 50k or more rather than my 20"" that were replaced at 31k! Just wish the Ridgeline made for the USA had all the Canadian Touring options. Despite the tranny the Pilot Touring AWD is far and away still my choice over the new Traverse and the much smaller Highlander. Our road trip to Florida was outstanding! Thanks Pilot!!! The Ridgeline will be a worthy replacement for our family of four.",5
1917, on 04/28/17 19:18 PM (PDT),Ed Kolb ,2016 Honda Pilot  Elite w/Navigation and Rear Entertainment System 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Serious transmission trouble.," Our family purchased a 2016 Honda Pilot Elite based on Honda's good reputation and experience we've had with other Honda vehicles.  Unfortunately the 2016 Honda Pilot Elite, which comes with the 9 speed transmission, has serious transmission problems .  We travel a lot and after owning the vehicle for 1 1/2 years already have 69 thousand miles on our Honda Pilot Elite.  Problems with the transmission started at 53 thousand miles while driving on the highway at which time the vehicle's transmission went out unable to shift out of the gear it was in.  Multiple display warning lights came on causing us to drop the car off at a Honda dealership out of town while on vacation.  The dealership recognized the transmission issue which reset itself after the car was parked in their shop for several hours.  Diagnostic testing failed to reveal any defects.  After picking up our vehicle which appeared to be functioning normally, the same problems started againg at 69 thousand miles.  After bringing our vehicle in to the local Honda dealership additional tests were done.  The transmission problem was again recognized by the Honda Service department, however no diagnosis was able to be made after updating software, changing transmission fluid and consulting directly with Honda Corporate.  We were lead to deal with Honda Corporate regarding our transmission issue as the vehicle's transmission was now no longer under warranty (ending at 60 thousand miles).  Although the initial transmission issue occurred at 53 thousand miles Honda has refused to cover the cost of our transmission.  The customer service at Honda Corporate was not what we expected from a reputable company such as Honda. Our Honda has been in the shop for 1 1/2 weeks now without having any work done on it since Honda will not agree to cover our transmission problem.  Since the Honda dealership was unable to diagnose the transmission problem while under warranty, they felt justified in passing the bill to us, the Honda customer.   We followed the Honda maintenance schedule and brought the vehicle in when the service lights presented themselves on our display.  It is apparently recommended that the Honda Pilot undergo transmission fluid changes every 30 thousand miles costing approximately $250 each service.  Our Honda Pilot was at the Honda dealership at 32K and 45K miles and thereafter, it was never recommended to us to change the transmission fluid.  Honda Corporate appeared to use this information against us to hold us responsible to pay for the failed transmission.  A district manager from Honda made a decision that we'd be responsible for $750 of the repair while Honda would cover the rest of the $6200 transmission.  Although better than paying for a new transmission, this problem occurred while under warranty and Honda is not living up to their promise or reputation.  The district manager who is responsible for deciding how much the Honda customer is responsible for paying apparently will not speak directly to the Honda customer, interesting to us.  We have already incurred the cost of a rental car while on vacation due to this problem and will be without our Honda Pilot for at least 2 1/2 weeks for the transmission repair not including the number of hours dealing with various customer service representatives getting to the point we are at now waiting for our transmission repair.  We are disappointed with Honda's handling of our transmission problem which will inevitably affect many more Honda owners in the future as most drivers of these vehicles have yet to place as many miles on the 2016 Honda Pilot as we have.",2

Got an extended (expensive) warranty, thank goodness.  The Bluetooth has never worked.  It has been in the shop 6 days.  So frustrated.  They replaced the audio unit which they said was 1,000 bucks.  It didn't fix the problem, now it's actually worse.  The radio will just start skipping around and has frozen twice- I had to shut it off completely.  Can't talk on the phone hands-free, which is a terrible problem for me.  I love the car, but I can't keep it if the infotainment system does not work.  So frustrated and just sad.",3

I bought a 2016 Honda pilot last February.  Last week, my air conditioning began to blow warm air.  I took it to a Honda dealership for a diagnostic assessment assuming that whatever was wrong would surely be covered under warranty with a car that is barely a year old.  I get a call stating that they aren't really sure and it may have been that a rock hit my condenser and that is not covered.  The dealership stated  that they see this all the time and it is in ""a vulnerable place at the front of the car.""  I have hit absolutely nothing and have never even heard of such a possibility happening on any other car I have owned.  The fix is $1200 on a basically BRAND NEW CAR.  Please others be aware of this design flaw in the new Pilot and purchase something else.  This is the first and last Honda I will ever own as I have been let down and feel as if I have been swindled by the company.  The employee said that the condenser does have a screen which meant the pebble must have been tiny.  So, apparently the tiniest of pebbles can take out an entire air conditioner in a Honda.",2

I do feel it is the radio because I can play my 30-year-old walkman transistor radio through the car speakers and it sounds good. Honda is still putting them radios in 17 pilots and crv.I also filed a claim with the national enter for dispute settlement and 2 weeks before the review Honda offered me 4 hundred dollars to withdraw my claim and the next week they went up to 1,750.dollars and they still said it works like it was designed.",1

This was not the same Pilot we had come to love.  This vehicle is tinny - the vibration and awful performance are staggering.  We recently took it on a 10 hour road trip. It was like sitting on an airplane next to the motor.  As we traveled down the highway I felt as if the hood was going to peel back like a sardine can.  I am hoping the dealership will take the vehicle back as we have just exceeded our 30 day period.  I should have been more aware of the fact there were 3,200 miles on the vehicle when we leased it realizing someone already knew what I was about tho find out.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.",1
1922, on 03/21/17 12:26 PM (PDT),JAG305 ,2016 Honda Pilot  Touring w/Navigation and Rear Entertainment System 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Loving our 2016 Pilot Touring AWD!," **Update as of 3-29-18.  We've now had our Pilot for more than a year and have put about 24,000 miles on it.  We still love this car, and I wouldn't change anything about the review I wrote in early 2017, below.  The transmission hasn't given us a single problem and is still the smoothest shift I've ever experienced in a car.  We've also driven the Pilot in the snow and it performs wonderfully.  We've packed it to the max inside and had car top carriers on it for long trips, have taken it camping, and have used it to shuttle kids around.  Great, reliable SUV that hasn't had a single mechanical glitch or problem.  The bluetooth connectivity is still a little frustrating, but i think we're used to how it works.  It's not very intuitive, and so I'm hoping Honda will have a software update in the future.  For example, figuring out how to switch from one phone to another is nearly impossible.   But that's the only complaint that i still have.  My wife and I read a lot of reviews prior to purchasing our 2016 Honda Pilot at the end of December, 2016.  There were so many reviews/complaints about the 9-speed transmission that comes standard in the Touring and Elite models, that we were completely scared off of those trim levels, at least initially.  We test drove a Pilot EX model, which has the old 6-speed transmission that we'd had in our older Pilot.  We didn't even want to test drive the Touring model because of the 9-speed transmission.  But then we did.  And we loved it.  And after three months and trips through the mountains, on flat terrain, in city traffic, sitting on highways in traffic, and etc... there is absolutely not a single complaint that we have about the 9-speed transmission.  In fact, i can say with all honesty that it is the smoothest transmission I've ever experienced.  Up-shifting and downshifting is smooth and nearly imperceptible, no matter what the terrain.  The tranny is very smooth and responsive as well.   My brother in law, who knows cars well, drove our car (and knew nothing about the transmission complaints in the reviews), and the first comment he made was that the transmission was incredibly smooth and quiet.  That was totally unprompted (I didn't ask him, ""so what did you think of the transmission"" or anything to that effect).  The Pilot has loads of room for our family of five and the dog, on long trips, and has plenty of power for the mountains.  The Touring model has a number of bells & whistles that we like that just don't come on the EX (including that very quiet, smooth transmission).  One thing that we appreciate the most is the extra sound proofing material in the Touring that doesn't come on the EX model.  It's makes our Pilot noticeable quieter than the cheaper model.  Test drive both in succession and I'm sure you'll agree.  The Honda Sensing takes some getting used to, but it's really handy, especially on long trips.  The braking on the adaptive cruise control can jolt if a car cuts in front of you, but i don't understand why people would complain about that.  Of course the brakes will apply if someone cuts in front of you!   In any event, three months and counting and we love our pilot and haven't had a single issue with it, except for some Bluetooth connectivity weirdness.  When my wife's and my phones are in the car at the same time, we sometimes having trouble connecting to the phone of our choice.  Who know's whether that's more user error than technical glitch.   As for the absence of a radio volume knob - that' s no big deal.  We love having what is in effect an iPod in the dash rather than some old analog knobs.  Great SUV.  We highly recommend.",5
1923, on 03/16/17 06:56 AM (PDT),Willsboro Bob ,2016 Honda Pilot  EX 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Infotainment is still Terrible," All Pilots come without a CD player – something that sales people should point out! It costs about $280 to have Honda add one. I had Honda add one. I drive a lot and listen to books on CD while I drive. It is important to me that the car remember where the CD left off when I turn off the car. That way it will continue the story when I start driving again. About 10-20% of the time the car forgets where it was and starts the CD from the beginning. I've owned 4 Toyotas, A Mitsubishi, and a Subaru and this has never happened with any of them. Otherwise, the infotainment system is a mess. It is not at all intuitive. It is difficult or impossible to operate with gloves on (I live in northern NY and it is cold in the winter). The voice commands are finicky. It forgot all the speed dial numbers that I manually entered!  The infotainment display occasionally gets stuck - an obvious software bug. As for the rest of the car, it downshifts too far when accelerating quickly. I pull a boat and admittedly, the car is good at that. The driver's seat is comfortable but the driver's seat arm rest tilts down at an odd angle and is next to worthless. The battery is inaccessible - I cannot use the car to jump start my tractor! In short, this could be a good car but it is plagued with a series of small but annoying design flaws and software bugs. Honda has been unresponsive to my complaints about the CD player.",1

This is really Honda's failure as it's high end car with major transmission issue for which we have all paid ~ 50 grand. Even if they change the entire transmission, the car has lost it's value who is going to pay for that?I have lost confidence of owing a Honda (have been driving accord and now pilot for last 11 years!!) Honda should recall this [non-permissible content removed]and pay us back- can be all do something about it? This is causing stress...**Update** sold the car at 15K miles eventually as the feel was very different  and the problem wasn't fully resolved.- Honda should have been more responsible as their customers loose money (I lost 12K) and general confidence in any Honda vehicles....**",3

Out the gate I have had problems with the entertainment system. Problems consist of hands free button not recognizing my voice, dropped calls, people saying it sounds like I'm in a wind tunnel (even though all the windows are up and A/C is off), radio stations not showing on the display, voice recognition system not being able to distinguish what name is being said, system randomly re-booting while driving, calls not being transferred to car system. There are more problems but I think you get the idea. I have an Iphone 6S (IOS 10.2.1). I have also tried paring a Samsung and LG phones to the system and still the problems exist. In the last 6 months I have had the entire info system replaced, the FM receiver replaced, and 2 software updates. Problems still exist. I have a case open with Honda USA and now (as of February 24th the dealer is saying that I have to live with the problems with the info system. I will be contacting Honda USA again. No one should have to live with a problem with a new vehicle especially after spending >$35k for the vehicle. In addition to the info system problems I am experience problems with the vehicle locking (or lack there of) while walking away. The dealer has replaced a sensor in the drivers door and a proximity sensor in the car but the problem still exists. Other issues include the wipers malfunctioning and the spin control system kicking in when the vehicle isn't spinning. I have owned Honda's in the past but they did a poor job on the new Pilots.Update 3/13/17On March 9, 2017 I was parked in a parking lot waiting for my daughter. As I started the vehicle I received 3 warnings which stated the following: 1) Brake system problem; 2) charging system problem; and 3) Anti-lock brake system problem. I had the vehicle towed to the nearest dealer through the Honda Emergency Road Service. The dealer is still working on the vehicle to figure out the problem.",2

Test it for yourself., I am seeing a lot of negative comments but if you are expecting a Mercedes GLE for under $35000 then you are dreaming. I bought Pilot LX 2016 for my wife while we own a 2011 Toyota RAV4. And after driving Pilot I sold my RAV4 to buy another Pilot LX. Reasons are : 1)Same 22.5mpg on both even though Pilot is much bigger. 2) Pilot was much smoother and quite (in RAV4 we could not have a conversation in the highway especially with people on 2nd row). 3)Much more powerful and better pickup (my RAV4 was 4 cylinder; can't comment on RAV4 2011 6 cylinder). 4) When we make trips with friends we haul them in our 2 SUVs (3rd row is good enough for 2 people under 6ft or 3 kids; contrary to other SUVs with 3rd row where your head hits the top on each bump.

I have owned Honda products since the mid 70's (cars, motorcycles, mowers, snow blowers, small engines) and had high hopes for their new flagship design. The good: mileage better than expected, solid feel, easy and accurate steering, road noise overall low. The bad: soft brake pedal when stopping. It reduces pressure itself and will physically move down away from your foot. Dealer says nothing wrong, (known issue with this vehicle) but they will tell you this is likely the yaw control activating. Have determined that it seems to be slaved into the transmission when it decides to downshift it reduces braking assist which is very unnerving. The radio cuts out sometimes and gives a warning that the ""clarionextraframenetwork has stopped working"". Apparently this is telling me that it has dropped the Bluetooth connection to my phone. Trying to use the hands free voice dialing system is infuriating sometimes. It's so unreliable that I mostly use Siri voice dialing on my Iphone. Honda dealer has advised the fix is to replace the radio. Honda corporate advises that there is no projected date for the replacement so I am stuck with a $42,000 car that doesn't have a fully functioning radio. Transmission now slamming into lower gear at around 40mph. Honda corporate asks for surveys and then doesn't respond to issues. Last lease was a Ford Edge with absolutely zero issues in 70,000 miles. Left Ford because of poor dealer service. Guess what I am thinking now?",3

The experience with this car is horrible.Recently, I noticed the water leaking into the car. During the rain in Fremont, CA, the water went inside the car all the way to the floor mat thru the dashboard. I took the car to the local Honda dealer to fix the leaking problem and inspect the dashboard and the floor. Water leaking could spread the rust quickly and may cause some electrical problem. A week later, I got my car back and within 2 days I noticed the water leaking problem is not fixed. I also noticed the metal inside the car dashboard is rusted. I believe, the service center didn’t inspect the dashboard, floor and find the root cause. Now, the car is at the same service center to fix the same problem.The car has not only this problem, it had other problems like remote key was not working, tail light assembly was broken when I got the delivery, screws in rear of vehicle were stripped, takes too long to stop vehicle completely and ON and OFF smoking while driving.The new car has too many issues, I’m also wondering how this car passed the quality control test and testing for water leaking. My main concern is a safety since I have a newborn baby(5 months old) and a kid. I feel traveling with my family in this car may cause issues like computer failure, sensor failure, etc., so I’m avoiding to drive this car with the family.I don’t recommend this car.Honda Customer ServiceHonda customer service is also worst. I tried to contact the case manager, but I couldn’t reach him to know the status of the car. After several attempts, I reached him, he was simply saying busy with his work and he couldn’t answer all my questions, just saying “he is not a technical person”.

To start, the third row is completely unsuitable for three people, even if they are younger kids. Two at best. Interior material is cheap - to the touch as well as sight. It will scratch VERY easily. The Garmin GPS system absolutely sucks! Most of the time, for the first two-three minutes, it has no clue where the car is. This happens to be the most critical period of driving if you are away from home and don't know your surroundings. Audio controls are the most confusing I have ever seen in a Honda! The engine seems to be confused on which gear to pick, and the amount of thrust to apply. Very hesitant. In the first two three months, it worked fine, but then started having a lag - very noticeable - in acceleration. Overall, very disappointed with our decision to buy the new Pilot.

I have to use the emergency brake every time I park even on flat roads.  The gear fobs on the steering wheel are a mystery to me.  I could be on a freeway going 75 and accidentally hit one of those and my car downshifts into D6.  Very dangerous.  I can't seem to shift back unless i look down and desperatly get it back into drive.  I do not know how to bypass that feature even looking at my owners manual. My car is always dinging.  Why?

I love Hondas and really only had one car in mind when it was time to trade in my vehicle.  I have two small children so the entertainment system was definitely important.  I also drive a lot for work so a clear, easy to use Bluetooth is also a priority.  Honda features are great with no concerns.  Now the Bluetooth.  I have two iPhones 6 devices (one ATT and one Verizon).  When I go to make a call, it has to make a voice connection and THEN you have to touch transfer on the screen to get it to switch to Bluetooth.  So long for handsfree calling!!  I took it to Honda and they said it was a Handsfree Bluetooth issue and that I should contact them.  If you google it and look at their compatibility, it only is up to OS 8.3  (the current update was 10.2).  It does not even mention an iPhone 7, so good luck if you have that.  My second issue is the RES.  If you have a child that can work the remote, they can handle it from the back seat. Otherwise, you are screwed and will have kids yelling at you that the movie won't start and it started over every time you got back in the car while running errands.  (Once again, Honda says it is the new DVDs that just do not work).  If the DVD goes to a start menu, it will not start automatically.  Apparently, older DVDs may have an autoplay and those supposedly will work.  Either way, there is no control over the movie from the front seat.  After paying 48000 for a new Honda, it feels like a kick in the gut, when all of the older models are more sophisticated and operate better than the new 2016.",2

Was excited to purchase the 2016 Honda Pilot. We have had the Honda for 1 year and 2 months..it has approximately 19thousand miles. Unfortunately, as the time increases things are starting to break. The passenger windows have had problems going back up...once down it may take several minutes to get the windows to roll up. The dealership is going to replace some parts and hope this will allow them to work again. The  second row Passenger seat broke and was unable to move forward or back..the dealership fixed and I hope the other seats do not have problems. The biggest problem is the transmission. The engine started to make a chirping noise about 2 weeks ago when shifting into 4th gear or when you got to about 10/15 miles. I took it in to find out that it is unable to drive and will take 2 weeks to repair because it needs a new transmission.  I find it a little scary after researching on the web that this is a common problem. I contacted the dealership where I purchased the car to express my concern. They suggested I call Honda directly. I have done this and now have a case file and they are to contact me tomorrow. With 3 kids and reading a lot of reviews of transmission problems and brake problems will admit am a little scared to drive once they fix. How do I know that this will not happen again or something else? I can't get over the fact that it has only 19 thousand miles and only about a year old. My husband is ready to trade the car in and call it a loss. Recommend doing a bunch of research before purchasing this type vehicle.",1

The Navigation voice activation is useless.  After dozens of attempts to utilize voice activation, I have resigned myself to the fact that it just doesn't work at all.  I thought that Garmin would have been good, I was mistaken.    I t hought the Elite had everything, including dual exhaust, wrong...the CRV does...but not the vehicle that costs 15 grand more.   The adaptive cruise control will freak you out when someone enters the lane in front of you in the protected zone.  It will panic brake, and thus panic YOU.   Again it is useless unless the road is totally clear.  I have had issues with the liftgate opening only to immediately close again to clock me in the noggin'.   In auto headlight mode, the high beams come on automatically when it feels like it.  I am not one to use high beams that often. I have owned many different makes of vehicles, and never had as many issues as I have had with this Honda Pilot.  Don't make the same mistake steer clear, without the lane keep assist.",4

(not sure if it just another electrical problem and the dealer told me they are not sure is the noise is coming from the transmission)  the dealer has not been able to find out what the problem is after 2 days and over 150 miles of test driving it; now they have a field engineer from American Honda coming to take a look at it.",1

We still love it. We have no complaints whatsoever other than the touch screen for the radio. Glad that Honda is putting knobs back for the radio.=======================================================This is an update review for our 2016 Honda Pilot EX that we bought in November 2015. We still love it! We have had no problems with this Pilot. Something we didn't mention in the prior review is that the grand kids love sitting in the 3rd row seats. We sometimes have had their friends along too - all of the kids want to ride in the 3rd row seats. A couple of the kids' friends (under age 12) have told us how much they like this vehicle. Adult friends of ours sat in the driver's seat to determine visibility. They liked it alot. They will be shopping for a Honda Pilot rather than the Toyota Highlander that they had previously owned, since they said the new Highlander does not have good visibility . All in all, the 2016 Pilot EX has been great.======================================================Prior review:We bought our 2016 Honda Pilot EX with Honda Sensing in November of 2015, so we have had it for a year now. So far so good - no problems whatsoever. We owned a 2004 Honda Pilot prior to the 2016, and had no problems with that vehicle either. We feel that the 2016 is quieter and more comfortable than the 2004. We make good use of the versatility of the 2nd & 3rd row seats: most of the time we keep the 3rd row seat folded down to allow hauling of luggage and other stuff to our vacation cottage, or for those stock-up trips to the local warehouse store. Often we fold the second row seats down too for added hauling space. We have also had 7 adults in this vehicle on several occasions with all the seats in the upright positions. That worked out just fine too. Everyone who has ridden in this Pilot loves it. They remark about how quiet and comfortable the ride is. The Honda Sensing allowed for an additional discount on the vehicle insurance too. We appreciate the lane keeper warning, and the comfort in knowing that there is collision avoidance for the front, although that has not ever deployed. We are very happy with this Pilot.",5

Check Owner Reviews," Worst mistake I ever made was buying a brand new 2016 Honda Pilot! My 2016 Pilot was purchased new in March 2016. I Drive about 30k a year so I wanted comfort and a brand that wouldn't leave me stranded as I ran up the miles. Little did I know that the issues would start at 5-7000k miles and by 18,000 mile I would just trade it in for a lose to get out of it and rental cars. May of 2016 my records show...No backup lights! Corrected lights and oil changed. Then the major issues started. First problem was the transmission searching for gears, ""that's normal, just v-tec"". Second was the AC only blows out of vents at a humid 67 degrees, 55 when they ""fixed"" it but in the South, that makes the air temp of the car a sticky 87+ depending on the weather, but ""that is normal"" and leaves you with a sweating butt, back, underarms and forehead. Fuel economy, that's a joke! 13.1 average but ""that is my driving style"". Fourth, popping in the front end, ""cannot duplicate"" although it's on safercar.gov as a reported issue.  Fifth, put the car in drive and it won't go! Well ""that's downhill assist and normal"". Sixth, car won't start but that ""can't be duplicated and it might have been because the driver didn't press the brake"".  Seven, no HEAT! So NO AC during the summer and now NO heat during the winter, that is ""just the new normal with these new EPA regulations"". Eight, the radio may or may not pickup local channels but ""that's normal"". Nine, the radio and camera dim to where you can't see it, but ""can't be duplicated"". Ten is when you press the gas to go while rolling and the transmission doesn't catch a gear, that my friends is why I traded this car today. Think turning left and car not going with traffic coming at you. Now I know why people sit at Left on Green when clear traffic lights! So I traded it in for a 4Runner. Info added per Edmunds email for update 6/6/2017: I lost the safety aspect of the survival cage that the Pilot has, my gas mileage is about 5 mpg better in the 4Runner, I lost the roomy comfortable interior and the awesome room of the cargo area and the storage tray in the rear. Other than those items, I have icy AC in a dark Toyota still in the same city and state that Honda said was ""normal"", I had heat this winter, and best of all....seven months in and I haven't had O.N.E. problem or issue with the 4Runner. Amazing huh? Especially since Honda said it was just me....Run and don't buy a Pilot or at least get a 2008-2015. I have friends who are still rocking theirs at 300k.Update! I’m now 12k into my used 4Runner and it’s been a gem!!",1

Acura has lost a lot of respect because of this 9 speed so WHY Honda do you put this in the new pilot???? Consumers Report has info on this issues saying to be careful or you'll be sorry. I trusted the Honda name so didn't do my homework before buying.

Our 2006 Explorer was extremely reliable and required very little maintenance.  We favor Explorers for two main reasons: it has a good towing capacity (5000lbs) and it easily carries or 2 kayaks when we put all the rear seats down.  We use it to tow our 19 foot boat.  We like the newer features of the 2016 such as the rear camera, bluetooth, synch, and touchsreen controls for entertainment and climate controls.   It is very roomy (can seat 7 passengers) when we need to take more members of the family with us.  It has always performed well in winter driving.  It is a very comfortable car to ride in and has a great safety rating.  It also has a lot of space to take skiing equipment in the winter time.",5

Not only does the hood of this vehicle already show corrosion (and it's been garage kept), the paint is also flaking off in that area. Of course it's not covered under warranty. I also had the keyless entry go bad on the driver's side panel and the battery needed to be replaced (again not covered under warranty since I was over 36,000 miles). I'm already beginning to have transmission issues with it and can't help but feel there will be some small print somewhere as to why that's not covered.  I can't decide if I should dump this vehicle now or just keep it until it falls apart... which by the looks of it, may not be too long. For a vehicle that is two years old, this is just unacceptable. After this, I'm DONE with Ford.",2
1958, on 05/18/18 03:44 AM (PDT),Marcus ,2016 Ford Explorer  Limited 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Great Vehicle but horrible seats," On paper this SUV This has everything you could want, the performance is good, the road holding and handling is amazing, it inspires confidence and looks good in a discreet way. However there are two major failings that mean we cannot wait to get rid of it. The Infotainment Navigation system is awful outdated and slow, virtually useless. And the main issue, the front seats are too short, they are hard, and no matter what position I adjust them to, they give me terrible aches and pains after only a few minutes driving. Previously I had a Chevy Equinox, 2013. That car had the best seats I have ever encountered, you could drive for 8  hours in that Chevy and never feel any discomfort. The Ford is a disaster, feels like they have totally compromised front seat comfort, and note that the middle row is also tight on space. All this in order to fit 2 barely usable jump seats in the back. This is a company Vehicle and is intended to be used for long road trips all over the US and Canada. I have covered 60 000 miles in 2 years and honestly cannot wait to be out of it. Wherever practical now I rent a vehicle or fly on business trips. I have driven everything from a Toyota Sienna to a Dodge Challenger and never come across another with such discomfort and pain. This is a pity, otherwise it rides and handles great, the steering and suspension inspire great confidence, it has been 100% reliable and not required any repairs. I cannot stress enough, that you need to really make sure you can get comfortable, the other comfort issue is the left footrest is at a strange angle and contributes to the aches and pains in my legs. I am 6'3 and 200 lbs so tall but by no means a giant, my wife, who's much smaller also hates the seats and finds herself getting numb and achy on all but the shortest trips.",3
1959, on 01/25/18 18:54 PM (PST),Kim ,2016 Ford Explorer  Limited 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Never again," I did a lot of research before buying our 2016 Ford Explorer and sadly it is NOT worth it!! I love the concept of it but it has barely been two years and we've had so many little problems with it! It currently has 40k miles on it and I want to be done with it. Within the first 5k miles, the controls for the radio stopped working. Since then, exhaust fumes come into the car when the heat is on, the side view mirrors stick, the driver side memory seating stopped working, the hands-free power lift gate doesn't work, and the 2nd row seats get stuck when they get folded. Oh, not to mention, quite impossible to access the 3rd row seats when you have carseats. I am so disappointed in our purchase. Ford has such terrible customer service that I can't believe anyone buys their product anymore. They also messed up our alignment and ruined our tires before the 20k mark. Never again will we buy another Ford product. I really wanted to love my SUV but it is just too much of a headache and burden than fun.",1

Would not accelerate, went into ""Limp Mode"" wrench symbol came on and engine light. Could barely get through an intersection from a stop, very dangerous. Brought it to my closest Ford dealer and after a few days, they replaced the clutch. Got it back and it was driving fine for a few days and it happened again. Brought to dealer again, but they couldn't get a trouble code, the wrench/engine light went off. Got it back again and it drove fine for two days, then lights came back on and went into ""limp mode"" again. Dealer told me if the lights go on and it doesn't accelerate, drive it right to the dealership and don't turn the car off. I did this and went for a ride with a tech to show him. When we were returning to the dealership, lights went off again and it drove fine. Tech said it was very strange, but they would be able to get a code, even though the lights went off. So now I'm on my 3rd rental and they are trying to figure out the problem. Luckily it's a lease and under warranty, so Ford is covering the costs. Super frustrating and clearly they are having serious problems with these drivetrains. Just glad I didn't buy my Explorer!

In the first 7K miles, oil leak, cooling fan noise, drivers seat heat/cool stopped working. Under 16K miles passenger seat heat/cool stopped working and axle assemblies needed replacement, thrust bushings??? and folding mirror squeak. Our Auburn Ford dealer just made all these issues worse. The squealing radiator fan they won't touch because it's  a ""normal"" squeal. Over a week on axel assemblies to be delivered. The Ford service system DOES NOT WORK. Its bad enough when things are defective but 10X worse when the FORD SERVICE department is incompetent. Check out your local dealer reviews before buying.",2

I was so excited because the car is beautiful looking.  The San Diego Police Department uses this model. It drives smooth and is very comfortable. The reason I am not buying out the lease is because I had two problems with the car 1) it started to overheat while driving this summer  (June 2017, I yr old). I took it and was told the the vent that closes and open's to keep the engine cool got stuck in the close position. It was fixed-customers service in Ford Perry in National city were great and professional. The car has been driving great; However this past week (Aug 2017), now the air conditioner stop working and I have been driving in a heat wave here in San Diego,  not cool, specifically since the car is only 1 yrs old. Once again took it in to Perry Ford and I am waiting for them to call me and tell what is the problem with the AC. So now I am debating if I should keep the car after the lease is over on may 2018... my brother tells me give them the car back and go for a toyota 4runner. I read their reviews and overall seems like a dependable car. I am sad because  I really like my 2016 Ford Explorer, but I am worried with getting stock with a car that keeps on breaking on you.. and cost money and headaches. I did lease a jeep cherakee on 2015, first week transmission was defected. . On before that I own  a toyota carmry 2004.had it for 10 yrs 250,000 never had a problem never only took it in for regular wear and tear maintaince/oil changes.

We are a family of 5, two mid-30's adults, two kids in car seats, and a young but arthritic grandmother. We also have two dogs. So we use the Explorer for everything. Things that are great, is that the vehicle is almost the size of a large car, but has the carrying capacity of an SUV. Also, the third row seats are great. Some things that are bad, however, is a completely limited view. Sides and sideways is difficult at best, and if you're driving around a curb, you better remember how that curb looked 10 feet earlier, because you won't see it at all. Also, the headlights are LED, ultra bright, really nice. BUT EVERY OTHER LIGHT IN THE SUV - to include the interior, high beams, and side lights, are yellow incadecent bulbs that don't give off any light! SMH. The Kia Sportage comes with ultra bright interior and exterior LED's and costs $5k LESS than the Ford Explorer, but nope, not the Explorer. It's like the Ford Factory had a billion extra bulbs left over, so they went ahead and used them. Really weak sauce in the design department. Also, if the sun is at your back over either shoulder, the interior silver trim reflects the sunlight right into the driver's eyes. The GPS system is weak as well, requiring you to spell everything out, and the mapping isn't the best, maybe a 2.5 out of 5 stars for the onboard GPS system for having tiny font. The seats have three memory settings that include seat, steering wheel, and pedal position. BUT THEY FORGOT TO ADD THE MIRRORS - EVEN THOUGH THE MIRRORS self adjust to a 'default' setting! SO every time you get in, you have to readjust the mirrors! Then the dashboard setting gives you all the information you might want, but gives you two tachometer settings (one with engine temp, one without) while leaving the MPG's on a completely separate outside setting. Also dumb. Seriously. This car is almost great, but the designers really dropped the ball on doing what was needed.",4

That not true, because there is definitely a nasty carbon dioxide smell when ever I an driving and I step down on the gas pedal. the smell is so bad and dangerous that I have to let down all four windows to get the smell out, I called the ford dealer two times about this problem that I am having with the explorer, I was basically I was told to take back the vehicle to the dealer, and that ford was working on the problem, so if ford is aware of the problem and has not solved the problem as yet, why is the agent telling me to take the vehicle to the dealer, makes no sense, any how the agent said that Ford would notify me by mail when they find out what is causing the smell.  I am not happy with the way Ford is handling this   problem and,   I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE HAVING THIS BAD ODOR IN THE CAB ACCORDING TO THE  FORD EXPLORER REVIEW",4
1973, on 02/17/17 16:07 PM (PST),CaliMom ,2016 Ford Explorer  Limited 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Don't buy a 2016 Explorer," I love the smooth and controlled ride of the Explorer but that is the end of my praise. I have owned this SUV for over a year and I'm so terribly disappointed. This vehicle is lacking in comfort and reliable electronics. The seat length of both front buckets and 2nd row bench are short, cramped and just all-around uncomfortable. Legroom is non-existant. I have 3 kids and a tall husband and this SUV is way too small for us. The 3rd row is tiny and hard to access. Cargo space is nice but robs the car from much needed leg room. The entire vehicle is just designed narrow and cramped.  There is so little room that my purse ends up on the cargo mats daily, covered in dirty shoes. And the electronics... I often refer to my car as having a mind of its own because the horn randomly beeps at me for no reason (much to my teenage daughter's extreme mortification). The cargo hatch/door on back also refuses to close on occasion for no reason... and sometimes closes on my head while loading groceries. And... after one year, the door lock has broken on the passenger side, one of the backseat seat belts completely shattered just from tilting the seat forward, and the poorly placed and cheap USB port covers have broken off. Really??? Come on Ford. You can do better.",1

Great ride, very roomy, and aggressive looks! Sparsely equipped until you've up into the sport and platinum packages. Ultimately bought a Chevy Traverse.  Got heated seats, Sunroof, and remote start for less than the Explorer XLT would cost.",4
1975, on 01/01/17 18:55 PM (PST),Dan ,2016 Ford Explorer  XLT 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Needs serious redesign of seats and interior space," I had a chance to drive 2016 Ford Explorer XLT 4WD for 9 days as a rental vehicle.   Throughout the years I have owned, rented and test-driven almost all vehicle makes and models of cars from economy passenger cars to luxury sports sedans, SUV's and even pickup trucks.Unfortunately I'm going to cross Ford Explorer off my shopping list and I cannot recommend it as a potential family vehicle even though I liked the previous Explorer I test-drove back in 2011-12.  It seems there are two vehicles within the Explorer.  On one hand you have a vehicle with a very nice drivetrain: a capable relatively apt and powerful engine (this is just a sub 300 HP V6 mind you in a heavy vehicle); an intelligent 6 speeds transmission; and a very comfortably tuned suspension.   We drove on freeways, mountain highways, uphills, downhills and engine and the tranmission coupled with Sports mode and steering-wheel mounted shifters enabled you to accomplish all the feats without much problem.    On the steeper hills though, regular Drive mode would behave more intelligently when going downhil, holding on the lesser gear and helping you brake with the engine.  On the uphills, regular Drive mode would however tend to constantly upshift even when you would manually downshift.  Once in the Sports mode, these problems would go away and the car would behave accordingly.However there is the other part of Explorer and that other part unfornuately makes the Explorer not so much attractive.  The faults I will list out are not new, but as have been already been pointed out by others in the reviews here.Seat design/driver comfort1) Terrible front seats with narrow hard bottoms, hard and high bottom bolsters. 2) Poor legroom area for the driver in width3) The above 2 is accentuated with absolutely terribly designed foot rest area.  The foot rest is very narrow, has a weird angle and also there is no space to rest your foot outward or stretch your foot  outward.   (And I was coming from just driving a Corolla and Camry).Many people here pointed out that these issues might be experienced partly because of the driver height.   But I'm a pretty short guy and I've experienced all these issues to a such degree that after about 30 mins of renting the car, I was complaining non-stop and had to tell my wife that I could not bear to drive it any longer.  Even after I switched to the passenger front seat, the 1st issue was still bothering me there as well.   I was ready to ditch the car and the only thing that stopped me was that I couldn't reach the rental agency and we were already far away from the pickup location.   My wife however was not bothered as much.  This leads me to believe that this is not as much of the height issue as the female vs male issue.  Females naturally don't mind seating with their legs close together whereas we males prefer to open our legs as wide as possible. Only after putting some bath towels, we luckily had, in the center of seat and thus leveling the surface I was able to somehow mitigate issue 1.  Child seatOK, so you would think that given how large the Explorer is and it's target audience it would do really well in child car seat accomodation department.   I was really hoping that I could install my convertible seat in the most safe position possible - center seat facing rear.  But I could not.  I couldn't use the center position even for the front facing installation.4) There is not that much space in the 2nd row seats as you would think, even with the short drivers and passengers5) The mechanism for folding the seats in the center seat is so large and obstrusive that it conflicts with seat installation, both front and rear.6) The same mechanism makes it hard to use latch installation even on the side seats especially in the rear installation.Minor thingsNow these things by themselves maybe minor but when coupled with the things above just add to the less the desirable portrait of the vehicle.7) Car very loudly honks when you exit with the key and engine turned on and there is no way to turn the feature off.   This proved extremely annoying and aggravating as you are trying to warm up the vehicle and it's interior and need to exit in and out of the car.8) Multimedia and instrument screen controls are needlessly complicated.  It took me  awhile to literally figure out how to do even the simplest things such as browing the folder structure on the MP3 CD or to reset the trip odometer.   There were absolutely no hints or labels on the controls to suggest that they would accomplish this or that feature.9) Locking the car.  Till the last day I could not figure out exactly how to easily lock the car by using touch feature.  Sometimes I would have to touch it twice, sometimes I would have to hold my hand there for a couple seconds, sometimes it would refuse to lock altogether no matter what I did and I would have to use the remote.10) Only one charge port upfront ???!!",2
1976, on 12/27/16 07:53 AM (PST),Tom Hueber ,2016 Ford Explorer  XLT 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Do not buy Ford Explorer not worth the money," We’ve had older Honda’s over the years with no issues with them besides normal ware and tare when things “should” go wrong and we paid way less for these cars.  So once we decide to give Ford a try and we spend a $30K on a car and get a newer car, all within a year of having a new $30,000 Ford Explorer with 20,000 miles on it we’ve a had a ton of problems with it since day 1.  It’s pitiful a $30K car is made so cheap and is basically a [non-permissible content removed].  The first two weeks we had it the drive belt snapped in half while we were driving to Dayton.  Within the next month both motors on windows broke and needed both motors replaced. Then we take it in to get brakes checked and they tell us all 4 rotors were rusted and had pits in them at like 28,000 miles, wow rust and pits in rotors already when the car is pretty much brand new.  We’ve had the car looked at again prior to 36K warranty expiration for belts because it sounds so bad and loud and they supposedly say everything is ok but you watch one of these belts are going to break again.  The leather seats in front are so horrible looking and look worn and wrinkled already and the heated seats barely work but it’s past the warranty and they wouldn’t do anything about it when we took it to Ford so we left as is.  Then 2-3 weeks ago my passenger side door would not shut and a piece of the chrome handle fell off around the lock and we finally got the door to shut, went to open door the next day and the handle completely came off and lock fell off.  I am surprised the whole door has not fell off the cheap ass thing.  Really???  a 2 year old car where the handle completely falls off????  And now we are getting a $380 bill to replace all this shit in the door when Ford did not obviously put it together correctly in the first place.   And it’s funny almost every ford has recall on their doors except of course the Explorer.  This is so freakin ridiculous.  Anyone know what we can do about the door issue with all the other recalls going on with all of their other cars???  Should we call Ford Corporate???Once we fix the door, looks like we will be trading it in for a Honda Pilot and WILL NEVER BUY FORD AGAIN.",1
1977, on 12/22/16 06:18 AM (PST),Jill P. ,2016 Ford Explorer  XLT 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),...after 13 months of ownership," I purchased my brand new Explorer in April of 2016. Here we are over a year later and despite loving my car I find it to be quite ""buggy."" First of all, the alignment was off since day one.  Finally took it in to get looked at today and it's not covered by the warranty because I'm over the mileage limit  – despite being an issue since purchase. In August, turned on the car and drove away. Within 50 feet I experienced a loss of power. The car stopped and I did all I could to move it to the side of the road instead of stopping directly in the middle. Dealer was great and knew what it was before even looking at it. They had a backlog of 2016 Explorers that needed the Throttle-body replaced. Luckily they had one in stock so I was only without my car for two days.  Nothing else major has occurred. But small things, e.g. going in reverse the back-up camera comes on and then stays on for several miles, even when shutting the car off/on or I've had ""Park Aide Fault"" messages – in other words the sensors around the car that help me park weren't working. Then my Navigation wouldn't connect for about a day. The Sync wouldn't pair with my phone for a couple of hours.  Also, it doesn't have enough cup holders or small storage areas. Despite all this, I love driving the car. It's very roomy and comfortable and will hopefully will serve us well when we start our new family. Although, I am nervous about the future and what major repairs may be in store for us.Update: I still encounter periods of time where the entire entertainment/nav/phone system shuts down and reboots.  And I can use anything for at least 5-10 minutes.  I get ""SD Card Fault"" messages, which prevent me from using the navigation.  The technology portion of this vehicle gets a ""Poor"" rating in my book.As soon as I hit 36,000 miles, my ""Park Aid Fault"" error message came on and has not left.",4
1978, on 12/14/16 16:29 PM (PST),Nicole ,2016 Ford Explorer  Limited 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),FORD refuses to stand by their own vehicle," My husband and I bought a brand new 2016 Ford Explorer (which was in the showroom). This cost upwards towards $50,000. Less then two months later my roof started leaking and my center console had a puddle of water in it, electeonics were soaked, seats soaked and floor wet. Took it to the dealership and they claimed it was a pinched drain in the roof and the problem was fixed. Less then one week later I went to get in my car and it was soaking wet again. Took it back to the dealership and they stated they poured water from a hose on the car for ""two hours"". They took the headliner off and found the other drain pipe was NEVER installed from the factory. So now they poured water on the car for two hours while there was no drain pipe installed. Called the Ford manager of Ford (not the dealership) - his name is James - and he claims there is nothing they can do other then pay ONE lousy car payment and extend our warranty for 5 years ... this is funny because the warranty does not cover mold and mildew. I am highly allergic to mold and my 2.5 year old son is too. This allergy triggers my asthma. James did not seem to care and reall didn't seem to want to help in any way. We are now in contact with our lawyer. I will NEVER but a Ford product again and cannot believe the vehicle passed the factory inspection - how many more of these are out there? Now since it was a FACTORY defect, it somehow is now OUR headache. I will tell everyone I know to never buy a Ford.",1

1980, on 12/06/16 11:40 AM (PST),Nicole ,2016 Ford Explorer  Platinum 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl Turbo 6A),"Turbo went out, causing smell of fire & smoke"," I leased my 2016 Platinum in Oct 2015. March driving home on my commute, on a hwy I received an error that my off road traction had been turned off, didn't know that it was on, and looking at dial it wasn't on. Just moments after that error came up I began to smell something burning. I thought it was from outside in the air so wasn't too bothered. As I went another couple miles, now on city streets the smell got stronger and by the time I got home a few more streets away I was very worried. I got out and my car was smoking but not on fire. I had it towed to the dealership for service. For the first couple days they couldn't figure it out and had a Ford Engineer come out and investigate. They determined that the turbo had gone out, not sure if that was the real problem or just their way around something more severe. Problem fixed. Just a couple weeks ago my cross traffic and blind spot fault came up, and this was during Thanksgiving, so waited until after the holidays to call for service. During that time went in for work and came out at 5:30pm to find my vehicles side mirrors folded in, so got in my car and they wouldn't open up, I tried to open up my windows to manually push the driver side mirror out, and the window wouldn't open for both driver and passenger. It is so dark during this season, but still drove home. I do not recommend driving at all with no side mirrors for any amount of distance. This 40 miles home in the dark on a freeway was beyond stressful. As I exit the freeway, another fault comes up - tire pressure fault. I take it in the next morning without an appt. I had to rent a car for 2 days since they wouldn't cover it. They reset the codes and all is fine. I pick up and 3 hours later all the same errors and window and mirrors go back to acting up. I drop it off at service Saturday morning and no one is there. I talk to the Sales Manager and let him know what is going on and tell him I will not pay for a rental, and that Ford will be picking up the bill. He did not hesitate as I have 3 kids in the car. It is now Tuesday, and I haven't heard from service manager regarding my car being there. Not sure what is going on, but this really worries me that it is so easy for them to just reset the codes and not actually fix the problem. Overall I love everything about this vehicle, and hope that this does not continue after I purchase it.....extended warranty is in my future.",4

I have driven Jeeps and a Tahoe in the past.  I am disappointed with this vehicle in that within the first year of purchase under 15,000 miles the transmission went out with a snap ring failure inside the clutch and additional sensor issues.  Transmission went out and left me unable to accelerate while driving down a busy highway with kids in the car.   It was in the shop over 2 weeks for them taking my car apart trying to figure out how to fix it and get the parts.  In addition the headliner was cut too short from the factory and continues to fall down on the passenger side door.  We paid the premium price Platinum addition and do not expect to have a headliner that is falling down.  It's been to the dealership twice to fix this issue and it is still not resolved.  Finally, my tire tread is already worn out and tires need replaced.  Really?  brand new car, less than a year old, less than 15,000 miles and I need new tires?  I drive in town on regular roads.  I am assuming the tires from the dealership are crap and Ford's taken the cheap tire approach.  I will not purchase a Ford Explorer again and will be trading this vehicle in the near future.",1

The front and rear cameras are a plus and love how they get washed when you use the washer fluid, the interior is roomy and comfortable (front seats could use some work, but I got used to them). I use it to tow and the motor has plenty of power. Trans is smooth. The ride is quiet and smooth.

A couple weeks ago, the vehicle lost power in the middle of a busy intersection.  Luckily, my wife was able to pull to the side of the road without being clobbered by another car.  The now infamous ""wrench"" light came on and the vehicle would only idle at about 2 mph.  No response to the gas peddle.  We had the vehicle towed to the Ford dealer.  They told us it was a issue with the software that controls the electronic throttle.  The dealer flashed some new control code and called it good.  The vehicle has exhibited some strange quirks, like an erratic idle at stop lights, since getting the new software.  Took it back to the dealer, but they insist it can take up to 500 miles before the computer learns our driving style again and that it will start acting normal sooner or later.  My wife won't drive the vehicle anymore.  I don't blame her.  What if the vehicle loses power again turning left in front of a semi or trying to pass someone on a two lane road.  I've been a Ford man my whole life, but I think that's about to change.  Thinking hard about trading in the 2016 Explorer on a Four Runner.  After some very heated debates with the service manager, they finally agreed to swap out the entire ETB.  The vehicle has run fine ever since.

However, there are a few things that are popping up and are annoying me.  MPG is low but then again I didn't expect it to be great ( it is a big and heavy vehicle) I average 18MPG in combine driving and 21 on the HWY.  Not too bad considering Chicago's traffic and me driving a bit on an aggressive side.   Interior driver's side floor sill trim is coming loose at the corner.  Leather steering wheel starts to peel at the top which is crazy considering the car is only 4 months old.  Looks as others had similar complaints.  SYNC crashed 3 times ( other then that it really isn't all that bad as people complained about)  Front seats suck.... they are too narrow and with stupid bolster so close it digs into my leg driving me crazy.  I'm 5'11 about 190lbs.   At the end of the day $50k paid for something that really looks as it belongs on $35k cars.  Wanted to go back to FORD but now I'm starting to regret it.Update,  the truck now has almost 14K miles and it's used a lot.  Ford replaced my peeling steering wheel and loose trim. Today, i still hear some creaks and noises from back door panel area that are not consistent so i can't pin point where it's coming from.  MFT crashed once but for the most part i actually like it better than the SYNC 3 i have played with.  Graphics on SYNC 3 look boring and basic. The seats still suck,  my hope was that after a year the side bolsters would give in a bit making it more comfortable, not the case.  They are still stiff.  The 2015 explorers had more comfortable seats.  Mechanically the truck is fine and that's the most important thing to me.21K update, i  truly hate these f....... seats.  Front seats are narrow and bolster too high digs into my leg.  I think i'll try to peel the leather and cut the foam down to be flat.  Why they even use bolsters on SUV???? they are not sport cars fricking moron engineers.  Mechanics are still good, but battery is corroding and looks as it has a defect from factory as i can see a dent by positive terminal so i'm sure that's where the acid is leaking out.

1987, on 08/28/16 12:20 PM (PDT),Mo ,2016 Ford Explorer  Sport 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl Turbo 6A),2016 Ford Explorer Sport 401A," I purchased my Ford Explorer Sport in June 2016 because I travel a lot and needed more space and reliability.  As of now, almost Sept I've put in over 9,000 miles by myself!  So I definitely have some input with long hours spent in the vehicle & I LOVE my Explorer.  First I'd like to start with a couple cons that are high on my list.  I hate the pedals!  The brake is significantly higher than the gas pedal which makes it very uncomfortable when transitioning to the brake, especially when traveling long distances.  The pedals are adjustable but they move  simultaneously.  My suggestion for future models is that each pedal have separate adjustment capabilities for better comfort.  While the leather seats are very stylish they aren't the most comfortable.  What I do love about the seats is that they offer adjustable lumbar support and after hours spent in the vehicle, the heated seats really comes in handy for any back pain!  You're also able to adjust the height of the seats, which I often have fully extended to compensate for the high brake pedal.  The GPS often gives last minute signals which has occasionally caused me to miss turns & exits.  I've noticed with the 2017 model they have changed they're GPS, offering zoom capabilities which the 2016 does not offer.  It would also be great if the vehicle offered different route options such as Google maps, so that you could see the different options on the map prior to choosing.  I find myself using both google map from my phone and the vehicle's GPS simultaneously to avoid errors or unnecessary routes.  Enough with cons...  At the end of the day, I couldn't be happier about my purchase!  If I had the option to do it again, even if offered the 2017 model at the same price, I'd choose the 2016 model I have today.  Though the SUV appears smaller than some SUVs on the outside, the inside feels very spacious & overall comfortable.  When driving, I literally feel like I'm driving a sports car.  I handle tight turns and u-turn in this SUV better that I did with my previous sedan car!  The ride is very smooth & the blind spot detection is remarkable!  Not even after having my Explorer for a full month, I was rear ended... No body damage!  The tow package cover took most of the damage and the only thing that needed to be replaced was the lower black portion and exhausted cover due to a few scratches.  I'm constantly complimented on this vehicle, it really stands out.  In my personal opinion the gas mileage is great & it takes me no more to fill the tank than it did my previous car, about $40 total give or take.  I almost forgot to mention, the clarity of the front & rear cameras are amazing, better even than some more expensive vehicles I've been in.  I hoped this review helps.  I tried to touch on some of the things that I haven't seen mentioned quite as much.",5

Anytime you accelerated to pass a car or just sped up, there was a smell of exhaust fumes in the cabin. After many trips to the dealer and finally filing a complaint with Ford, they reacquired the vehicle in October of 2015 and we purchased a  2016 model. We were told that problem had been repaired on the 2016 model. That was not the truth. We are now going through the same process with a complaint. Not sure how this will turn out but will not have another Explorer. And that is really sad because we love everything about it with the exception of not being able to breathe when the cabin fills with exhaust fumes. 2-28-18 Wouldn’t own another Ford if they were half price! Worked with Ford a few months to repair problem but was never repaired. They finally stopped returning our calls so we traded it off for a vehicle we could drive that didn't almost cause us to pass out.  We love our Toyota Highlander and will NEVER own another Ford!! Of course we lost a boatload of money on the trade in.After several trips to have the problem repaired (and it wasn't), Ford  cleared our complaint and stopped taking our calls. We finally bit the bullet and traded it in at a high loss for a Toyota Highlander. We love the Highlander and will NEVER purchase another Ford product!!",1

If your feet are just under the bumper & you are getting something out of the back, it can start to close on you.  They state that it will stop if it feels there is something in the way, but way too much pressure must be placed against the gate for it to stop.  Several of my friends have been bumped hard on the head.  Also,  once when I was opening my automatic  garage door (my car was parked about 1 foot away from the door) the lift gate started to open even though no buttons in the car nor on the key fob (it was in my pocket & nothing bumped it) were pushed.  The bottom of the gate was jammed against the door which made the garage door stop opening.  The bottom of the gate was bent & I had to get it repaired at the body shop ($1,000).  I decided to disconnect the sensor so it wouldn't work.   It can still be operated using the remaining buttons.",4

Great Family SUV. 2018 update," If you want a SUV that has great acceleration, the bells and whistles technology has to offer and fits your family comfortably for long road trips this is the car for you! I originally had a 2014 Limited Ford Explorer but 290hp is not enough for a heavy SUV. (aka CUV) So I traded it in for a 2016 Explorer Sport and WOW love this one! With 365 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque it's the engine my Explorer needed. My husband and I tested it in the real world. We were able to get 0-60 in 6 seconds flat, not bad for amateur drivers;). This car is so comfortable for long road trips. Traveled straight for 9 hours with my husband (um we did stop for bathroom breaks three times) , my 81yr old mom, my 6'1 tall son and his girlfriend and every one was so comfortable. I know people think the third row leg room is small, but my son is 6'1 and he rode in the third row just fine. My 81yr old mom is able to get in second row seats very easily because the design of the foot entry is lower then other SUV's.  For example she couldn't get in the Jeep Grand Cherokee I was thinking of getting before I bought my Ford. I also love the new additional front camera on my Sport it helps me menuever tight corners like at some fast food drive-thrus. My Sport is loaded with Adaptive Cruise Control, Blind Spot warning which is a definite plus, we used it all the time during our 9hr road trip. Sorry to read some reviewer's Explorers breaking down on road trips, but my personal experience with my 2014 Explorer Limited and now my 2016 Explorer Sport is that they both have been driven with no problems except the Sync system shut down twice and we had to reboot it by turning off the car and then on again, other than that absolutely no problems with engine, comfort or technology. 13,800 miles driven so far.Update 2018: After putting in 30,000 miles we still had no problem with our 2016 Ford Explorer Sport except for the Sync system which was really slow. All is solved now! We traded it in for a 2018 Ford Explorer Sport with the 365 hp eco boost engine.  (Note: This is NOT the XL with the outside sport trim, I don’t know why Ford decided to offer that, it confuses people!) It’s loaded with 2nd  row bucket seats which I highly recommend. So happy that the new 2018 Sync system works like a dream! It has Apple Car Play and Android Auto capabilities! Umm..It’s just my own taste but the Explorer Platinum model is just too fancy for me.I’m done now. This 2018 Ford Explorer Sport is a keeper!",4

Need to get a recall on this car.  I was lucky - I was only in a 45 mph area when all of a sudden the lights come on and the car slows down -- I have time to pull over and take care of things, but I can only imagine if I was on the highway going 70 mph.

This vehicle is not worth the money.  The advertised fuel economy on the sticker says 18 city and 26 highway for the 4 cylinder and AWD.  I'm lucky to get 15.5 combined.  The acceleration is tepid and the transmission keeps looking for the right gear to be in.  It's not confidence inspiring.  Ford's advertising with the ""unstoppable"" and ""fight song"" are even more of a joke when you consider how poorly designed this vehicle is.  The interior leaves a lot to be desired.  With a $43,000 MSRP, this is getting dangerously close to other vehicles that are way more luxurious and not based on an old Volvo platform.  The plastic trim used in the interior feels cheap.  There doesn't appear to be any foam or soft touch paint on any of the plastics.  It feels like this vehicle was designed as cheaply as possible.  Getting in and out of the third row is an exercise in acrobatics and don't put Grandma in the back if you want to see her come out alive again.  You have to climb over the second row seats to get back there.  Visibility on this vehicle is terrible too and the seats are really uncomfortable.  The test drive I took was not extensive enough obviously.  Save yourself some money and don't get this vehicle.  Aside from the exterior styling, this is a complete disappointment.  My first and last Ford SUV.  I'll go back to the other brands I used to drive before this.  I'm glad this is only a 2 year lease.",2

I would have given it 5 stars, but I believe Ford could do better with acceleration and gas mileage, even with the tow package option.  The navigation system is quality, but has difficulty learning voice pronunciation; could have used a better onboard GPS system.  The ride is very smooth and the vehicle handles very well, even with significant water accumulation on the road, etc.  Interior is well appointed, controls are well located and responsive.  My purchase has the tow package and the 6 cyl. engine did extremely well pulling my utility trailer.  Frankly, if they could improve the overall mileage on the 6 cyl. (when not towing), this will be an excellent all around choice.  Personally, I am very pleased with my purchase so overall the car really ranks high in my opinion when compared to the others in this SUV slot.",4

Overall I would give the vehicle 4 stars for attractive redesign and decent road manners. The vehicle had alot of nice features for the price of that model. It was all wheel drive and averaged only 21 mpg, but with a heavy foot (avg 85mph on interstate). It held the road well at high interstate speeds. The six speed auto behaved well outside of the almost always wanting to downshift at the slightest hill. The best word to describe the feel of this SUV is ""pudgy"". It is thick...dash, pillars and body. It drives similarly...not fat like a truck based SUV but you can still feel the weight in its performance. I found myself looking for more power on occasion, but the V6 is a decent mover when pedal is mashed. Nitpicking small things annoyed me like the design of the steering wheel. You cant hold the bottom of the wheel and the buttons for the functions were numerous and difficult to discern by feel...you have to look down to find right button...not good. The cloth interior (Black) was actually pretty nice. Durable and easy to keep clean. I didn't miss the leather and sunroof, but I did miss the auto climate control and auto rear view mirror. I hated having to constantly adjust. The third row lays flat nicely and the depth of luggage area increases when seats are pulled up which comes in handy, but still, as with most midsized suv third rows, its pretty tight in the back for people and luggage when the seats are up and not easy to climb back to the back seat for an adult. Overall though I would rent again. If for no other reason than decent space and comfort.",4

We're now back on our 9th, 10th+ visit to the dealership depending on how you look at things and yet now answers to a fix. Attempt on our part to bring Ford Corp. into the picture to help resolve the issue has only complicated matters and not provide one bit of feeling that they're really concerned and working to fix this ongoing problem. Less that 3k miles on the vehicle and many have been put on by the dealer and/or the back and forth to the dealership for service. A lot of talk but little action. They say they'll somehow make it right in the end for us...not sure what that means, but the air has long left our balloon after doing a significant amount of research on the vehicles that appealed to us and that met our needs, and after spending a whopping near $60k.

2000, on 08/02/16 21:48 PM (PDT),Disgruntled Ford Owner ,2016 Ford Explorer  Limited 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Found on Road Dead," I own at 2016 Ford Explorer.   I was on my way to Chattanooga, TN last week when the wrench light came on and the SUV lost its ability to travel over 3 miles per hour.  It had 4,800 miles on the odometer when this incident occurred.  This incident occurred approximately 35 miles from Chattanooga at 1:40 p.m.   I called Ford roadside assistance and they are about the most useless group of people on the planet.   Making a long story short, it took over 3 1/2 hours to have a service truck dispatched to take me to tow me to the nearest dealer.  I arrived at the dealership about 6:50 p.m.  The Ford roadside assistance people offered no assistance in helping me to obtain a rental car.  Ultimately, I was left stranded at a closed dealership and had to take a $50 cab ride to the airport to rent a car.  The problem with the SUV ended up being the throttle plate.  It is very troubling to me that Ford is selling an automobile that they know can at any time leave you stranded by the side of an interstate.  Even more troubling is the fact that when this happens, you are basically on your own.  Ford roadside assistance is a joke and the people that I dealt with could not have cared less about my situation. The National Transportation Safety Administration should require an immediate recall of the 2016 Ford Explorer.  If they fail to do so, eventually this problem is going to end in tragedy for someone.",1

Last week when I was coming home from the beach driving over the Robert Moses bridge, the car lost power.The wrench light came on with a message to check the manual. Somehow I managed to cross lanes to get into the right lane. However, there was no safe lane to be in. Cars are driving at a speed between 65-75 mph. There was the railing and the ocean below!! I had my son and his two friends in the car. I was terrified we were going to get hit and go into the ocean! I had my hazard lights on but I think it was difficult for drivers to see in the daylight.  Cars had to swerve to avoid hitting me or stop short when unable to get in the middle lane. Luckily no one was hurt, but this could have easily turned out differently. When I brought the car in to be serviced the sales department seemed to be aware of the problem. Turns out the throttle needed to be replaced. Ford needs to correct this problem before someone is seriously injured or killed! Now I'm afraid it will happen again.",3

BE CAREFULL!!! 8400 miles," I NEED to post a review with the rest of the people that have experienced this issue and Hopefully Ford will finally do a recall!! The same issue happened to me this weekend when my family and I (5 people) took a 4hr drive from New Hampshire to New York City. About 2.5hrs into the trip all of a sudden my 2016 Ford Explorer with 8400 miles started sputtering and running rough and I when I pressed on the gas nothing happened and the wrench light, check engine light and air bag light all came on. I had to drift over the breakdown lane on the highway! Luckily it happened where it did, there was a big enough breakdown lane, there are big stretches of the highway that only have jersey barriers and NO breakdown lane. If that was the case a major accident could have happened! So here we are stuck on the side of the highway (Saturday) with basically a brand new SUV, calling AAA and finding a ford dealer that is open. Called about 6 of them and finally found one that was opened past 12:00 noon. Luckily they told me to tow it to them (45mins away) and they will bring it right in because they knew exactly what the issue was since there fixing a lot of them. They said if they can't fix it right then we were pretty much screwed because all the rental car places close at noon. So basically we would have to rent a hotel room and wait till Monday! After waiting on the side of the highway for for AAA to tow the truck, we also needed had a cab pick up my wife, daughter and boyfriend because the AAA truck can only carry 2 people. The cab came first and got them after an hour and my son and I waited the additional 2hrs for AAA, (3hrs waiting). While I was waiting I looked online to see  what the issue is and read everybody's review on the same experience happening to them and still NO recall. The dealer ship was able to replace the part (in 15 mins) and get us on our way. This was at 5pm when we should have been in NY by 12:30 so the whole day was ruined. How do I know this won't happen again? The same part was installed not the recall part! The 4hr drive back to New Hampshire was the most stressful i think i have ever been not knowing if my truck will just shut down with no notice on the highway with my family. This experience could have killed us or someone else. Please tell every 2016 Ford Explorer owner you run in to..",3

The Ford has all the appointments that a Euro/Japanese Lux SUV would have at much lower price point. I got stuck with the vehicle in limp mode on a semi-busy road at rush hour with my two boys. Roadside Assistance was very impressive through the whole thing, but by reading blogs and comments on different forms I believe Ford should issue a formal recall for the throttle body. It was a one day fix and I think I am good now. I still would buy the car again based on the value / dollar spent ratio versus high end SUV competition. Love the new LED and LED fog lamps, it's almost like never having to drive in the dark. Brakes are a bit soft and feel challenged to come to a stop quickly.

Dealership was not the issue ford and ford quality and customer service set a new low that I did not expect.  Three weeks after purchase blind spot and cross traffic indicators began to fail, this lead to nag aviation failure, A/C failure, front windows stopped working, seat adjustments failed, seat memory failed, seat massage ceased working in very uncomfortable position, defrost may be on with no way to turn off, and tire pressure alerts (tires were fine).

After taking a new car apart and putting it back together unknown times and a Ford engineer coming twice to work on it - I was then told it was now fixed - it is no longer a new vehicle, it has accelerated depreciation due to all the mechanical issues and I can no longer trust it for what it was purchased for.

There isn't a single option that this car doesn't have in it.  The vehicle handles very well and is extremely comfortable to drive.  My two daughters love it too (ages 8 & 10).  They especially love having a console between their two captains chairs. The 3rd row seating is descent in size and comfort.  The interior is luxurious and appealing.  In terms of controls, everything I need is right at my finger tips.  My previous SUV was a 2007 Mercedes GL450 and it was no where near as comfortable and did not have all of the extra features I have now in my new Ford.  My Mercedes was also extremely expensive to maintain and repair.  One  impressive new feature I have now on my Ford is the park assist.  It's amazing to watch the car literally park itself in either a parallel parking spot or back itself into a perpendicular spot with minimal effort on my part.  I also love the key-less entry feature and push button ignition start.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a new luxury style SUV.",5

Thank God this didn't happen to me as I was driving on a busy Los Angeles Freeway like I do during the week!!!

The service guy at the dealership told me that he's had a boatload of 2016 Explorers come in with the same problem and that a recall should be coming soon.

It adds some really high-end interior finishes and some handsome 20"" wheels to the offerings of the Limited, and it truly is the definition of luxury. The ride and handling are superb, and the acceleration is smooth and exhilarating. It is REALLY fun to drive. After months of research, I chose this over other similar vehicles because it had exceptional power (365HP versus 290HP for most all competitors, which you can REALLY feel) and it has more total technology offerings than any of it's 2016 3rd row vehicle competitors--without escalating into the true luxury vehicle segment (like a Volvo or BMW). It's counterparts in 2016 lacked at least one (but usually many more) features such as adaptive cruise, pre-collision warnings, power-fold seats, lane keeping assist, parking assist, front camera, power-folding mirrors (with auto-fold), rain sensing wipers, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, intelligent access (based on proximity with key on your person), remote engine start, adjustable pedals, and door keypad entry. Yes, this is an expensive vehicle. But, it truly compares more with a higher-end model, like a Cadillac or Lincoln, than it does with it's true competitors (GMC, Toyota, etc.) in this segment. If you are looking for THE BEST 3rd row SUV for a great value (meaning, not luxury vehicle), this is it. If you just want the cheapest 3rd row SUV, then this is obviously not your market. But, if this is your market, or even if you're looking in the luxury market, this may just be the vehicle for you--unless other manufacturers make some pretty decent changes in 2017. I am thoroughly impressed and extremely happy with my purchase.Update January 2017; 7700 miles: No major issues to report. I have had a problem with my front wipers--and had the dealer replace both the blades and the arms (at no cost). The driver side was especially bad. It would not make good contact with the windshield and would leave streaks and sections of water. It wasn't extreme, but it was directly in my field of vision when driving. I'm not 100% pleased, but it does appear to be improved upon installation of new arms. I may try some other brands of blades to see if it is just the OEM brand. I saw an Amazon review of a 2016 Explorer owner who bought the OEM replacement from Amazon, who also said his originals and the replacement streaked. So, I believe this is just a poorly designed part, and I will be trying the aftermarket brands. Other than that, I've had no problems, and I am still HIGHLY pleased with my Explorer.",5

I was on a major highway with my 3 year old child when going from 80 mh the car just completely came to a complete stop. I was hysterical crying. The manager at the service dealer informed me shut the car off and restart the vehicle I did it multiple times till finally it started again, he informed me to try and drive it and or call the tow truck i called the tow truck and was informed over an hour wait. so i proceeded to drive to get off the major highway, the vehicle shut off another 5 times before getting off the major highway. The dealer had my vehicle for exactly 17 days waiting on the part. i was hoping it fell under the lemon law being its a lease. My service manager stated he can't guarantee it not happening again.

We could have be in a serious car accident. FORD is knowingly selling people these cars playing Russian Rullete with you family's safety and lives. The part has been on back order for months and the internet is lighting up on this issue with these cars yet FORD has failed to issue a recall even now. At the dealership they begged me to keep my car because giving me a new one would lose the dealership so much money. Like I give a damn about their profit after they knowingly sold me a vehicle that puts me and my family at risk. Do your research on customer complaints about the SUV and ask that the part be replaced before purchase if you really are shallow like me and still want the car for its sexy body.

Last week, while driving on a major highway at 70mph in the center lane, it just shut off.  I'm so lucky that I didn't cause an accident.  Finally got it working again and was able to get home.  The dealer scheduled it for service but didn't seem concerned and it would be a week before they could see it.  The next day, it did it again on another major road 4 TIMES.  I barely made it home and then called a tow truck.  It's been at the dealer now for 6 days.  The Throttle Body Sensor is on backorder (probably from so many cases) and they have no idea when it will be in.  They would not offer a rental car because I didn't pay for the extended warranty.   So not only was this VERY dangerous, I'm now without a vehicle for almost a week or more b/c of this.  Ford should at least offer a rental car.Update on 12-29-16 with 11,000 miles.  Ever since the throttle bottle sensor was replaced, I've had several issues with this Explorer.  The computer doesn't work right:  Memory seats don't always work (once it moved my seat all the way forward while sitting in it),  the volume on the blue tooth and navigation change on their own, the lane change assist doesn't work right, the side mirrors get stuck in the closed position, there is a delay in the acceleration and several other issues.  Took it in for service and they couldn't find anything wrong because they said the computer didn't show any problems.  Hello?  The computer isn't working right!",3

By doing this, I learned a lot about the vehicle and about prices, etc.  I decided to buy from the dealership I've been faithful to for 12 years with my old Highlander.  Big mistake.  They had no loyalty to me and everyone there, from the top to bottom)  lied to me.  I guess they think all people are dumb and won't figure that out.

This vehicle ranks high in Consumer Reports as well many other reputable reviews to include top safety reviews.  The major items for improvement are:  1.  need for LED headlights, a car at this price point should not have mediocre halogen lighting that lags behind the competition.  2.  transmission is not as smooth as it should be.   Minor items:  1.  stopping distance in severe inclement weather could be shortened, it is ok and ultimately secure.  2.  The amber airbag light is constantly on high on the dash and is a constant unnecessary irritant. 3.  The ""power"" setting needs to be a button next to the transmission for instant on/off without having to click through a menu of options.  4.  The menu needs to be more user customizable (eg seeing range and max speed posting or other combination there of).  5.  The Navigation screen has too much glare in high sunlight conditions.   The unit also lacks Apple Carplay.   6.  The ""chromtec"" wheels are a cheap plastic cover that is bonded on the wheels.  It is impossible to repair them when nicked or scratched and requires a full expensive replacement.  7.

2037, on 08/21/18 10:36 AM (PDT),WLueder ,2018 Toyota Highlander  XLE 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Great car with some exception," I have had the car for almost three months so  feel qualified to make some observations.                                                                    Here are the positives about the vehicle:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The ride and comfort are excellent. I am 6'4"" tall so front seat room is important. I require room to stretch my legs while driving distance and the Highlander provides that room.  Other SUVs I have tested don't always provide as much room. I have driven a couple of long trips and have been quite comfortable.  On the trips I have taken I have averaged 26-28 mpg. I believe that is very good since I am usually driving 70 - 75 miles an hour. The leg room in the front and second rows is excellent. I appreciate the safety technology in the car, especially the safety features such as the lane departure warning.     The storage in the back of the vehicle is very good with and without the second row seats down.                                                                                                                                     Negative aspects of the vehicle:                                                                                                                                                                                  The fact that only certain phones work with the Enture system is disconcerting as my Motorola phone does not work with it.             The Navigation system is WAY behind others.  My Garmin and Waze are light years ahead of the Navigation system. It does not take me the best or shortest route.  Also, if I do not follow the exact directions when close to the address, I get false “you have reached your destination”.  As an example, I turned a block early from the directions provided and when I passed a block behind my destination, it said I had arrived!  When returning to my home, the navigation wants me to go the long way around ( an extra 2-3 blocks) . When I go the short way, going behind my house ( the shorter route) I get the same arrived at destination message.   I also get false “slow traffic ahead” messages.  The blind spot detector , while nice to have, only gives the warning when the car in the lane is actually in the blind spot.  My Hyundai Sonata has a computer that determines how fast the car in the lane is going and then provides the warning MUCH earlier than the Highlander. In the Highlander I still have to look which kind of defeats the purpose.  In the Sonata, I rarely even have to double check.   I am surprised that Toyota’s electronics are behind my three year old Korean Sonata.   As others have said, the third row is not very good for adults unless we move the second seat forward which then necessitates moving the front seats forward to give the second row adequate leg room.                                                         I like so many things about the Highlander, it is a shame that the shortcomings are so glaring.",4

I do not like that lane warning system it pulls the steering wheel out of your hands to correct once almost put us into a wall. Do not like the cruise system we can slow the truck down ourselves, storage room in back is small, our last vehicle had more room. My wife is short and we find the vehicle hard to see out of, she sets the seats then it drops down. I should be in control not the damn truck. All in all made a mistake I made a very large mistake for purchasing the SUV. Took the thing on a long trip seats,(all seats) were very uncomfortable. I guess the only thing that was ok was the gas mileage. If I could I would get rid of damn thing I would , but I would loose a lot of money, so I am stuck with it.",3
2039, on 08/21/18 07:08 AM (PDT),Charles Hammes ,2018 Toyota Highlander  XLE 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Using navigation? Don't buy Toyota.," If you are considering buying a new Toyota with Navigation, you need to read this.  I have a new 2018 Toyota Highlander XLE and the GPS is BEYOND ABYSMAL.  Better GPS units existed ten years ago and NO, I am not exaggerating.  I have persisted with the GPS in ten states now and this is a hardware, map data, and algorithms problem.  The navigation system is junk and Toyota has to knows it.  With the navigation system, you will drive a lot of extra miles, take slower routes, go to outright wrong locations, be warned repeatedly about bad traffic when NONE exists, and the list goes on, and on, and on.  Contradictory navigation information is displayed on the monitor and the control panel.  The same item of navigational information is move around the monitor at different times -- and my favorite -- you will frequently be told to turn after you are through the intersection.  If there are several turns is short succession, secondary and tertiary turns are sometimes never announced.  Also, if you have music playing from a USB, (I have not tested the other audio sourced yet) the volume is not adjusted and voice directions are unintelligible. Yes, it is that bad.The worst part is that there is no good work-around.  If you are hoping to use your smart phone GPS to get ""real navigation”, you will suffer badly.  First, if you use voice recognition to enter a destination on your smart phone, your voice commands are routed to Toyota Entune and it will try to make a phone call.  That’s right. If you say 252 North Road, Albany, Entune tries to dial your phone and fails. (Unbelievable.)If you key in the address into your smart phone, you are also punished.  You will have no voice directions.  They are disabled by Toyota.  This means you will need to read the directions from you smart phone while you are driving.  (Hardly safe.)Next, you can get full smart phone GPS functionality, if you disable your Bluetooth connection to the Toyota.  But, then you are punished again!  Once Bluetooth is turned off, the hands free phone feature no longer works.  You will need to answer your phone manually and hold it to talk.  You will also have to dial your phone manually.  (Hardly safe.)  This also means you loose all of the other apps in your cars Entune system; that includes the ability to stream music from your phone.  (So why did you want to buy a Toyota?)If you NEVER want to use the GPS on the Toyota or use the GPS on your phone, a Toyota is fine.  The vehicle is mechanically sound, is highly reliable, has good breaks, and won’t rust.  All of those things that were so 90’s.The last time I checked, this was 2018 and GPS systems are a lot different now, if you do not buy a Toyota.  Did I mention that the voice recognition is 10 year old technology?  (Don't get me started.)  Toyota is a good hardware company who obviously has no idea how to do software or was too cheap to buy the real thing.   I will NEVER buy another Toyota after being cheated like this.  I hope this helps unwitting victims of Toyota’s drastically inferior navigation.  Many other manufactures have “modern” GPS systems.  Do your homework.I am greatly dismayed that this obvious information was not made explicit by professional reviewers.  Toyota was given a pass based on past performance.  It is time for the pros to step up to the plate do their due job.",2
2040, on 08/18/18 16:30 PM (PDT),Chris Hornberger ,2018 Toyota Highlander  Limited 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 8A),2018 Toyota Highlander," My wife and I bought our 2018 Toyota Highlander in mid-May of this year. Two weeks later we noticed a loud humming sound from the AC blower when the auto temperature control would go up or down. At the same time we watched the radio/navigation system randomly cut off and re-boot while attempting to use the hands free Bluetooth phone option. Videos and pictures were available for the dealership. They fixed (replaced) the AC blower and (supposedly) replaced the radio all together. The car had a whopping 1500 miles on it when all of these issues occurred. Over the course of the next two months going into late July, the car was back and forth in the service center for continual radio glitches where it cuts out and re-boots in its own. Contacted the BBB to file a Lemon Law Complaint on Toyota only to find out that Toyota does not participate in the BBB Lemon Law program. Toyota claims they have a non-biased approach to dealing with such complaints. Anyway, per the owners manual, we contacted the Toyota Corporation and filed the complaint on the safety concerns at this point with an undetermined short of sorts on the radio/Navi combo. They had me bring my Highlander back in for their Field Mechanic to look over the car. When the corporate office called me back, they were immediately trying to push blame on my wife and I as to this issue being our fault because we had one iPhone 6s and one iPhone 8 Plus. Then they said, well the emojis are causing the system to have issues, again, as if this was our fault. Then, we’ll, maybe you have too many phone contacts and it overloads the capabilities of the radio. When asked how many contacts were too many, the person said a 1000? Between my wife and I we might have 600 contacts. I posed the question back to the case manager and this is my fault how? Here is the long and short. The car is a lemon and Toyota does not want to admit fault and or fix my car which stickered for almost 47,000.00 US Dollars. My recommendation to anyone reading this is to stay as far away from Toyota and their products. We will get resolution to this at some point via arbitration if needed, but for you, stay away from this vehicle and company! They do not care about the safety of their customers and will stop at nothing to keep from losing and admitting a mistake!",2

Great ride, lots of standard features (leather, moon-roof, good sound system, navigation, 3 rows, power lift, blind spot, pre-collision) all included - to get the same from the other 3 you'll likely be about $5-8k more. I have approximately 10k miles on my Highlander, it has had nothing but an oil change (Included maintenance for 2 years or 25k miles).

I've had it for three months now and very much regret buying it. Overall, it's a very good SUV but the transmission/drivetrain is a failure. The 8-speed transmission is uncertain and unpredictable at lower speeds (less than 30 mph). It hesitates, stalls, downshifts, and does whatever else it decides to do without any warning or sense of purpose. We live in Washington, DC, and driving in stop-and-go traffic in this Highlander is frustrating and dangerous since we don't know what it will or will not do when we need it to go now! I drive a lot of rental vehicles and have never experienced anything this bad; in fact, the 1996 Nissan Pathfinder I gave up for this was far, far smoother. It does have the automatic stop/start (which I really like -- they've had that in Europe for a long time), but the issues I describe are with the vehicle already running. I brought it to the dealership and the service department did a road test -- said it checked out normal and there were no outstanding service bulletins.

We had a Chevrolet Avalanche with only 39,000 miles ...total LEMON!  GM was horrible and so was the local Chevrolet dealership!!  Since I had previously owned six Toyotas, including a Land Cruiser, I decided to go back to reliability.  I have the 2018 Platinum Limited Highlander and I love it!  All the reviews here are spot-on.  It is awesome in every way.  I can't believe how smooth this car is!  It is going to be my FOREVER car.  It was a very difficult decision because there are so many choices, but now that I've had this car for over a month, I absolutely love it in every way and I am convinced that this was the right pick.  The moonroof is awesome!  The style is awesome!  The comfort is awesome!  The features are hard to believe!   My ONLY negative is the automatic stop and start feature.  I'm having to get used to that and honestly, I wish I could permanently turn it off.  I think it gives me such bad memories of my Chevrolet Avalanche stalling.  I have to constantly remind myself that this is a TOYOTA!  It is so good to be back in a Toyota!",5

It is what I've grown to expect from Toyota. I didn't buy the Highlander with all the bells and whistles and it meets my needs. I do not like the electronics, especially the the automatic slowing of the vehicle when the cruise control is activated. The dealership tried to disable it, but it won't disable. It almost got us killed. We were on a four lane divided hwy. The Highlander was on cruise control as it approached another vehicle. It automatically slowed down my vehicle as designed. I moved over into the open inside lane and the vehicle went back to the set speed of 70mph. There was other cars that was following behind me as we moved over to pass the slower vehicle. As my Highlander, with cruise control still active, was passing the slower vehicle there was a turn lane to the left allowing vehicles to turn across the opposite lanes. The automatic system somehow picked up a car in that  turning lane. Keep in mind my lane was completely clear in front of me. However, the Highlander's auto system picked up the car in the turn lane somehow and practically locked up my brakes as I was going 70mph almost causing vehicles behind me to crash. I was able to quickly disable the cruise control and accelerate. Not a fan of this new electronics and the dealership can't seem to disable it. It has sensitivity settings and I had it on the lowest possible setting when this occurred. It needs improvement or there could be injuries from a crash in a situation like we experienced.",4

So because Toyota allowed these Highlander's with a dash deform to leave the factory, it's not their problem. Our doors won't lock by touching the door handles. Wind noise is terrible and inside of doors get covered with road dust and dirt due to poor design. We have also had the front bumper pull apart from the fender to where you can see the clips.

My choice was between the Toyota Highlander and the Honda Pilot, both top of the line models. The Pilot had an edge because I already own one. After test driving both vehicles at least a couple of times, I found that the safety features on the Toyota Highlander were better than those on the Honda Pilot. With the Pilot, I found that I had to purchase features such as a video system in order to get the lane shift feature I really wanted. I love the Highlander, which surprised me since I've really enjoyed my 2012 Pilot. The Highlander rides like a luxury vehicle. In comparing both 2018 models, the Highlander was a more luxurious, comfortable, feature laden car. ",5

I had owned 4 Toyotas previously, so we felt good when we decided to purchased our 2018 SE AWD Highlander.  I do miss our auto window up from our previous vehicle.  Also, there is no digital speed display available on the dash.  It only shows the cruise speed digitally when the cruise control is applied, not what speed the vehicle is actually doing.  Which I find funny, because the 2018 Tundra we leased at the same time, has the option to do this. Those are easy accept, however after only 2800 miles, the transmission has now failed.  New transmission installation will be complete tomorrow, and I'm very skeptical of a vehicle with this significant of an issue this early in ownership.  Will certainly continue to update this review if able, going forward, but take this under serious consideration before buying one yourself.",3
2063, on 03/21/18 09:08 AM (PDT),John A. ,2018 Toyota Highlander  Limited 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),"Great, but lots of road noise on some highway surf"," I bought the 2018 Highlander due to the many standard features, great reviews, and lastly price comparison.  No matter what the price, if you don't buy what you like, you'll never like it, so why cheap out.   There are many great features in the highlander, nice interior, power, safety features.  My previous vehicle was a 2010 explorer and I found it nearly overwhelming to test drive and compare all this new stuff on different vehicles.  It’s a lot to consume in a relatively short test drive; it takes days to get to know a vehicle.   I settled on the Highlander, considered Jeep, Kia and more.  Other reviews pointed out there are many things that beep at you.  Yes, but all are expected, seat belts beep if you take it off, lane departure alert beeps, if you have it turned on and change lanes without signaling.  Also the lane Alert button is a ""sticky button"" and does not reset each time vehicle is started, so I only turn it on when I want it for long highway drives.  Love the adaptive cruise, makes CC useable.  Love the collision alert, have heard the beep and actual braking once when going into a turn a bit too fast (distracted by all the new stuff), it detected the trees on the outside of the turn and braked just enough to slow you down a bit and alert the driver.  So I think this was an appropriate response.  Obviously there’s a lot more to these systems that I am yet to experience.  Lane departure will nudge the wheel in the right direction, but ultimately the driver is in control and the nudge I deem appropriate.     I like everything about the new Highlander (including auto headlights, lots of driver legroom, good GPS, great looks, plenty of power, smooth ride, quiet around city, and more)  except, the LOAD road noise on some highway surfaces.  Need to determine if the Toyo tires are the cause or what I can do about it.  I spent 8 hours in it this weekend on Highways and hated the road noise as 91N and 89 through VT seemed entirely like rough surface that produces too much road noise.  The road noise changes dramatically with the road surface and I have not noticed/experienced this with previous vehicles including the2010 Ford Explorer I drove 142k with various tires.    Also, the JBL speakers are not good. I have a good ear for music and no level of adjustment could make it sound good.  The front speakers bounce off the windshield and the whole system is tuned too much for base. I turned base way down but still not good. I never tried the stereo during test drives , assuming it would be good enough and didn’t want to blast the sales person or spend the long time it takes to check all these things, stereo was lower on the list.  I was wrong.    I would like to hear other reviews/comment on road noise and sound system.   The styling of the Highlander is also great, and I like the interior over all. Driver’s seat is VERY comfortable for me and adjusts many ways.  Overall I like the Highlander a lot, but the road noise is a big issue for me, and if reduced would help the sound system.   With only 2150 Miles, I’ve gotten to know it but will update this review and I hope it helps someone.",4

After three months, we feel like the quality has gone down some compared to previous year models, however, the cost has gone up quite a bit.

There are times where the temperature over heats inside the vehicle although the the temperature setting is in a normal range.

2075, on 02/12/18 09:24 AM (PST),Dennis ,2018 Toyota Highlander  Limited Platinum 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Review for serious shoppers," Fair warning, this review is long, intended to provide the kind of consumer details that professional reviewers won’t notice in their few hours with a car.  I generally agree with the professional reviews, and if only looking for a 30 second summary, my review is not for you.  We’ve owned our 2018 Highlander Hybrid AWD Limited Platinum about a month now.  Other contenders included a Lexus RXL, Audi Q7, Acura MDX and Honda Pilot.  While never unimportant, price was not the top concern and we bought which one we like the best.  That was the Highlander, including over the luxury brands listed.  Because we were comparing to and shopping the luxury brands, we ended up at the very top trim level possible.  Comments:  We’ve been getting about 25 mpg.  While not the EPA rating, the EPA doesn’t drive 75 mph either.  For a 4500 pound vehicle with over 300 hp, I’m hugely satisfied with the mpg.  While many reviews single out the infotainment center as a “con”, it was a huge plus and primary selling point for us.  I hate anything that looks like a tablet was stuck to the dash or involves a mouse, joystick, wheel or any other weird input method.  The Highlander uses a touch screen, flush mounted in dash, as it should be.  Regarding device connectivity, you can connect both a phone and another device for music (like another phone) at the same time if you want.  Convenient to have the kids DJ from the back seat, while still keeping my phone connected.  The system downloads all contacts, can directly control device music, reads your incoming texts aloud, streams Pandora or other content from a device.  OK, it’s not CarPlay……but I think it’s better.  Takes about a day to learn, but awesome after that.  Toyota, don’t change a thing.The 5 USB power ports (2 in front, 3 in back) are a big deal and a “must have” for our family.  Not all competitors had this.  The 110 AC household plug is nice too….already used it to keep the crockpot plugged in and warm enroute a Super Bowl party.At the higher trim levels, the interior is luxury level.  On par with the Lexus RX, better than the Acura MDX in our opinion.  As professional reviewers have noted, the seat comfort is world-class.  By far the best of any comparable vehicle we looked at.While I can’t disagree with the professional reviews that XLE is the “value” trim level, it’s not ridiculously more to move up.  Limited adds $3K, then Limited Platinum adds another $3K. For perspective, each is well less than 10% of the vehicle price, or collectively, about 15%.   For that, you get the following - upgraded wheels, upgraded audio, panoramic moonroof, surround view cameras, front and rear parking sonar, 2 person memory driver’s seat, power passenger seat, LED daytime running lights, heated 2nd row seats, heated steering wheel, heated mirrors, air conditioned front seats, rain sensing wipers, cargo cover.To us, it seemed very worth it, especially if comparing to and considering luxury brands.  On the luxury brands, the option packages cost more than that and often don’t even deliver nearly as much.  While not “required”, many of these options are a big deal to us and certainly worth paying for.  We use them all the time.  Heated second 2nd row seats…. our teenagers love ‘em.  Surround view cameras and parking sonar, tremendously helpful.  Driver memory seats – needed for a family vehicle where more than one person drives.  Panoramic moonroof that extends all the way over the 2nd row – kids love that too.  These are great family vehicle options, which is exactly what the Highlander is.Drivewise, the ride is mini-van-esque, which is a good thing (doesn’t drive like a truck).  Nothing exciting, but pretty much what you want in a family hauler.  While I wouldn’t call it an everyday 3rd row, the 3rd row is very serviceable for occasional use and more than met our expectations.  When folded, it also looks neat and flush.  Some of the competitors didn’t.  In summary, the family features are what make this car.  Specifically, all the USB power ports, the panoramic moonroof, the heated seats for everybody, the adequate 3rd row, the driver memory seat, passenger power seat, the ability to connect multiple Bluetooth devices simultaneously.  Most vehicles just focus on the driver.  The Highlander focuses on the whole family, especially at the higher trim levels, which is exactly why we bought it.  A month later, we’re still loving it and are 100% convinced we bought the right vehicle.",5

So far the SUV is great, except for a couple of things.  We didn't realize that the speedometer didn't have a digital readout.  Not really a big deal except we have had this on our vehicles for a long time so it will take a while to get use to not having it.  The reason we bought the Platinum edition was because we wanted front parking assist.  Our other vehicles have had this on them since 2012.  We rely on the front parking sensors a lot.  The sensors on the Highlander are WORTHLESS.  Our other vehicles systems will give you plenty of warning before you get too close to something.  The Highlanders sensors point out to the front corners and there are no sensors in the middle of the bumper so it doesn't pick up an object that is directly in front of the vehicle.  Plus they will not warn you until you are 2ft. from the object that is on the front corners.  Very disappointed",4

I am surprised that they do not have BSM with rear cross traffic alert as standard, part of Toyota Safety Sense because those two things are needed to avoid many accidents.Not so good - No Android Auto or Apple Carplay, No garage door opener, sluggish engine/transmission in Eco mode, MPG much lower than advertized - 22-23 MPG on highway (although this may improve as I put more miles, have only 3k now), flimsy doors, no power driver's seat for a car with a sticker price of almost 36K!. The other car we have in our family is a KIA Sorento and in many aspects Sorento beats Highlander with its powerful 2.0 turbo engine, solid built and fantastic MPG of 28 on highway. The Highlander had the same sticker as our 2016 Sorento and we have many more features for that price in Sorento like dual power seats, leather heated seats, push button start, BSM, rear cross traffic alert, power tailgate, integrated shades for 2nd row and 110V outlet. Just comparing the Sorento key fob to Highlander tells the story. Sorento's fob is so nice that it really can be compared to a luxury SUV. The doors feel solid in the hand compared to Highlanders. Toyota has to include certain things like garage door opener/power driver seat/push button start as standard when marketing a vehicle as a semi luxury SUV and charging mid-30s for the price.Conclusion:Overall it is good, but at least go for LE Plus version ($38K) and don't expect MPG as advertized. I would say Toyota has a lot of work to do to keep up with the competition that is zooming past it.",4

Interior could be a bit classier but it is still good. This is a family hauler and it does that incredibly well. This is a solid generally pleasing vehicle. I test drove countless competitors comparable models multiple times. It took me 3 months to make this decision. Overall ride quality and standard options combined with Toyota’s undeniable reputation of quality and dependability won me over. I have to admit though that every American made suv in this class was superior in comfort, quality of interior materials, ride comfort and amenities out shown every Asian vehicle we tested. However these tended to be priced higher and there is of course the questionable reliability. We tend to keep our vehicles for a decade or more so dependability was the ultimate deciding factor. There is one large problem with the Hylander, the outdated and outgunned engine infotainment system. This system is difficult to navigate and lacks basic things like smart phone mirroring. I am at a total loss on why Toyota would install such a poor system especially when just about every competitor has a much more advanced and intuitive infotainment product. I will say this though the navigation programming is excellent. It is easy to set, has nice graphics that make sense and are easily readable.",5

The Cadillac XT5 and Q5 were just a bit too tight in back seat (2nd row) for me.  I found the 3 best were Acura MDX, Audi Q7 and Toyota Highlander.  After test driving, the MDX and Q7 are sportier but the Highlander did everything very well.  The Q7 had buttons in unusual places (at least for me) and the MDX had push button transmission and 2 screens for changing settings that took a few touches to change heat settings.  Coming from a Lexus, I knew Toyota built a great car but the front seat is very comfortable, has all the safety equipment and is very easy to see out of, I chose to save $15K and buy the Toyota.  Reliability, gas economy, resale and initial cost are all better with Toyota and I'll have alot less problems down the road.",4

My EX-L has extremely annoying wind noise by the front driver's window starting at about 55-60 mph and which gets louder the faster I go.  Seals and door seating is proper according to dealer.  Bad design resulted in this wind noise.  The Touring and Elite also have this noise but it is subdued somewhat by the acoustic glass.  Dealer says it's due to the shape of the mirrors.  I've never had a car (and I've had many in my 40+ years of driving a car), where the wind noise was that bad.  Besides that, I love the car.  Roomy, smooth shifting, comfortable right, very quiet until you reach higher speeds, interior configurations are very versatile, plenty of cup holders and storage, love the ability to tell the exact tire pressure in each tire, love the auto locking doors when I walk away from the vehicle. Gas mileage could be a little better.  I'm getting about 22 mpg based on stop and go traffic.",3

The technology upgrades are very significant.  Big learning curve but I am enjoying this SUV.  The fuel mileage is better than expected for this substantial vehicle.  The economy setting helps.  I am looking forward to a longer highway journey in late September to determine how it will do on a long trip.  Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.  I visited three dealerships and drove four vehicles in my search.  I researched this size SUV using many internet resources.  Recommend getting internet prices to enter the fray.

In my online review and research of the 2018 Pilot, I really liked the exterior design, the interior space and design, and apple car play.   When I test drove the vehicle it performed very well.  During the test drive of the Pilot I made a terrible mistake by NOT checking out the apple car play because I was so excited about the vehicle itself.  However, now that I am leasing the Pilot, to my surprise and disappointment the 2018 Honda Pilot LX 2WD DOES NOT come with an apple car play.  Instead it has a low grade, second rate, hard to Bluetooth pair/sync, very basic car system.  As soon as I discovered my mistake, I contacted the dealership but to NO AVAIL I’m stuck with this vehicle for THREE YEARS!! ☹  The moral of the story is if you demo a vehicle online make sure you know the exact model being demoed.  What I discovered is the online reviews and information of the Pilot ARE only the EX or ELITE models.  I will never make this mistake again.",3

I was pleasantly surprised with the Pilot. It has all the creature comforts I want with out the price tag.  Being that it is a Honda also gives me the peace of mind to know it’s dependable.  The car is very roomy and I love the side camera. I wish the moonroof was a bit larger and the armrests on the front and passages side seem cheap but everything else looks great.  The pickup on the touring 9 spear transmission is a bit jumpy but I’m fine with it.  Overall I love my new car and can’t wait to have many years of fun road trips! ,5

Out of all the cars I have had this has never happen especially since the car was brought brand new and is only a few months old. I paid the extra money for the paint warranty and when I took it to Honda to get the bumper painted they made it seem like it was my issue but after pleading my case they decided to repaint the bumper. All the bumpers on the Silver pilot should have the bumper guard added as part of the car. Because I am sure I am not the only customer with the Silver Pilot having that issue.

This went on for several cycles and we were ready to call a tow truck, since the car had been backed into the street. Finally, after shutting down the engine for about the fourth time, the transmission went into ""drive' and ""reverse"" normally.

Very happy with our decision.  We were between the Pilot, Highlander, and Atlas.  The Highlander was smaller and didn’t have Apple CarPlay.  The Atlas, although nice, doesn’t have the track record the Highlander and Pilot have.  Although many reviews complain about the 9-speed transmission, we have been happy.  It does behave differently than a traditional transmission but it just takes time to get used to.  Very happy with how quiet the interior is at highway speed and the ride is great.  Very happy with the mileage we are getting so far.  We only have a few dislikes…the infotainment system is a little slow and not quite as intuitive as it could be.  I wish the auto start/stop feature could be disabled permanently instead of having to do it at each start-up.  Although it has the premium sound system, the bass is lacking but is sufficient for a family hauler.  I wish the Honda Link app would allow you to remotely start the car.  Rear entertainment system is great for trips with the kids.  I can use the HDMI input and use my phone to stream movies.  Overall very satisfied with our purchase.",5

We’ve never owned any car model that was equipped over base models i.e. power windows and locks. We are somewhat savvy with new electronics. That said the dealership (Vandergriff Honda) assumed we got enough of a briefing at the delivery because they forgot us after that. The rear entertainment took over all systems and we had heck figuring that out for ourselves. There are 4 screens for apps and widgets but the system doesn’t allow any or there are none available. I checked forums. Apple CarPlay is the only option that works. Changing from radio channels to navigation on CarPlay needs to be done by a passenger for sure. Lane Keep is taking some getting used to and the new cruise control isn’t built with Texas traffic in mind. You have to set options like door locks and auto lock for each remote. The mirrors are included in seat memory despite what the salesman says. We still really like driving the car though.,3

Since safety is the main deciding factor in choosing an automobile, I am very disappointed that I was not able to add this feature to the EX, as advertised.  I don't need nor want most of the extra features that the next trim up offers, so did not purchase the EX-L- too many add ons, more things that can go wrong with the vehicle. I did want leather seats however, but the option to add leather seats to the EX was not given to me either. I was given the choice of 2 colors that would be available - blue (did no want) & white. The white exterior is very nice but the black cloth interior is a magnetic - every piece of lint, dust, hair, & dog fur is attracted to the fabric! It is a daily routine , every time I get in & out of the car, to use a lint remover-  very, annoying!  I have had to spend a lot of time, money, & innovation to enable my dog to go for a ride in the vehicle, opposed to my last SUV with a more user friendly cloth interior.  I use to bring him for a ride a few times a week, now, because of the interior fabric, my dog has only been in my car 1x over the month & ½ that I've owned the car. I was told for 5 months, that the Pilots would be available & per dealer websites told  that they were in stock, only to keep being told (by my flooring up) nope, they are not here, they would say their website did not update or nope, they are not here, but will be in a couple of weeks. It actually took months before I could even test drive the car! I would be told the 2018 were there (as the website said), but only 2017 were actually for there.  In addition, although the Edmunds dealers offered a price online, when I would respond to dealers's Edmunds reply email &/or visit them they would state that the Edmunds quote email they gave me would  not necessarily be the price they would actually sell the car for;  or they would state the price , after I put in my exact option requests, & then when I contacted them to confirm, the options they said in their email the would be included were not going to be part of the price given.When making the purchase, I was told the out the door price would be X amount but was then charged document/registration/plate charges.I was told the car would be ready by a certain date, but that they wold be putting a later date on the contract. I had to follow up each time to see if the car was ready (which wasn't until the later date then what they told me opposed to what they put on the contract. I asked if i could have a loaner car if it took till their later than i was told/wanted date. They said no.)   I really do wish the side mirrors & rearview mirror had built in blind spot mirrors,- the vehicle is long, so blind spot's are difficult to view unless the turn signal is put on. Otherwise, I do really like the Pilot.",4

This is our 5th Honda(03 Pilot EX, 13 Honda Fit Sport, 13 Honda CRV EX-L, 17 CRV Touring).  I chose the EX-L trim because it was the closest match to my daily needs. I felt the ZF 9speed would drive me crazy with the auto shut off and all the nannies trying to assist me.  The 6 speed shifts smoothly and always is ready to drop a gear. Acceleration is plentiful, especially when merging onto the freeway.  The visibility is superb with low window sight lines and lots of glass.  The seating is awesome with plenty of room in the 3rd row.  The RES will get it use by my son and his friends on road trips.  The driving dynamics are pretty good but the steering is vague and the brakes don't give much feedback, but again this is a passenger hauler not a sports car.  I have had good experiences in the past with Honda's and this one should be the same. I perform all the maintenance on my vehicles and have never had any issues in the past 30 years.  Oil changes, filter changes, and tire rotations are about all I need to do with Honda vehicles.  The maintenance packages offered by our local Honda dealer are very expensive($3000+) and are essentially glorified oil changes.  If we decide to keep this more than 3 years, then I may buy a Honda Car extended warranty. Great job Honda!",5

I looked up “rotten egg smell on acceleration Ford Explorer” to diagnose what I could be smelling to see if it was an issue that I should bring to Fords attention, and I was appalled of the articles that popped up. The smell I was smelling was exhaust leaking into the cabin and was the reason I had been feeling sick. Ford had been receiving complaints about this since 2011 models and was refusing to recall these vehicles and continued to produce and sell them. Ford is refusing to admit there is a problem. The deny all claims and told me that because my vehicle was a 2018 it wasn’t affected by this, although they allowed it to go on from 2011-2017, and admitted to smelling the “rotten egg smell” however claimed my vehicle was safe and the smell was “normal”. They refuse to perform the inspection on my vehicle which would determine if CO2 and other hatful exhaust fumes are leaking into the cabin and I am terrified to drive the car and refuse to allow my family to do so. Ford should be ashamed and I am furious I didn’t do better research before purchasing from Ford, because thousands of complaints over the last 8 years prove their neglect.",1

Drawbacks: slurps gas (I knew this going in).  Does not have active pedestrian detection/ night vision systems which are available on some other Ford models.  I am leasing because I am hoping this will become available in a few years.  Ford, you need to put this on all your cars!

The extended warranty does not cover tires. Obviously I was thinking no problem, the tires aren't worn out, the leaking shocks caused the feathering on the tires which caused excessive road noise and vibration. Although the defective shocks caused the problem the warranty still will not cover the tires. New (installed) tires are $250 each. Aside from that, the gas tank under the front seat is uncomfortable you cannot put your feet near the seat, only forward when resting your non driving leg. The charging ports are in the worst location ever. Don't expect to be able to reach them while driving. The cup holders are too deep or too short. Try putting a 16oz coffee cup in there. You can't get it back out and if you put the flap down to raise the cup up it will topple ever and spill. The seats are uncomfortable and make your lower back hurt. Had to turn the head rest backward or you have to slouch because it's angled so far forward. The interior material is very cheap as is the rest of the car. The plastic handle jams and is going to break any day now. This car is 1.5 years old with lots of highway miles. The only thing I REALLY like is how the back seats flip up or lay down for more storage. Good price point but I guess you get what you pay for. 36 mpg average is good too.",3
2140, on 06/20/18 08:21 AM (PDT),Kristen ,2017 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Great car other than a few minor details," When I first purchased the HR-V I loved it. It drove better than my previous car had a sun roof, blue tooth and I love the camera features that come with it, such as the right turn camera located in the side mirror (I dont understand why they couldn't have put that on the left side too). After a month of owning the car I was rear ended at a traffic light and ever since, my HR-V hasnt been right. The dealership replaced my back hatch and all was good. Until it started making a rattling noise which they say was the strut. So after replacing that I've since been in and out of the dealership for the same noise. They have replaced both struts, shocks and anything they could think of that would be the problem. A couple weeks went by and the problem seemed to be fixed, but nope. Still making that noise and it drives me crazy. I shouldnt be having this problem with a brand new vehicle. The review I really wanted to leave about this car is about the windshield. Im not sure if anyone else has this problem but I feel like the windshield is at a weird angle or too close to the driver because the way the sun beats down on me is like no other car I've been in. I have to turn the A/C on full blast at my fact to even feel a little of it. This in turn makes my feet and overall body sweat while im driving and I hate it. I hope I'm not the only one having this problem. My last complaint is that I hate the 4-cylinder but thats not a problem with the car just my personal preference. I do see they came out with a turbo option in the 2018 version which would have been nice. Overall, I love the car but just wish I could change the windshield.",3

2146, on 11/12/17 13:55 PM (PST),New Honda Driver ,2017 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl 6M),Nice car," Never having owned any sort of SUV and knowing Honda to be a reliable brand, I went there thinking to see the CR-V.  I asked to see the 'small SUV' and was shown the HR-V instead, which I did not know about.  It was several thou less in price, perfectly sized for what I wanted a small SUV and knowing Honda to be reliable, went there and asked to see their small SUV thinking it would be the CR-V and was shown the HR-V which was new to me.  However, it was a fine size, smaller slightly than the CR-V, fine for two people and dogs and periodic need for carrying amounts of things.  After a test drive, decided to buy.  No regrets so far, 5 months into ownership.  Side by side on the street with the much more commonly seen CR-V, it does not seem much smaller; personally, I don't see the reason to plunk down a few thousand more for the CR-V over the HR-V.  Mileage is OK but not great.  Stability on road is fine, road comfort at fwy speeds fine, little road noise.  One sits up higher and visibility is good. Back seats folded down provide excellent carrying capacity; they also have a pull-up thing which makes the rear passenger foot space like a deep well which should be useful at times.  There is good room up front for someone at 6 foot two and decent back seat room as well.  This is the mid level model which for a little more than the lower end one is very nicely equipped; the upper tier is for folks who don't much care about money being spent or simply must have something it offers.   I must say the Honda colors do truly suck, though: white, red, variations on black and grey, and a purple blue which is what we have.  More purple than blue but there it is.  Saw no need for a 4 wheel drive, so bought the 2 and saved another thousand or so.  Even though we bought it on the last day of the month, toward the end of the day, we still had to do the irritating back and forth with the manager/salesperson: that alone is enough to put anyone off buying a car for the duration....  The true test will be in 2-4 years but knowing people who have owned Hondas for years, I expect this will last a good long time.",4
2147, on 09/22/17 14:36 PM (PDT),Jim Galluzzo ,2017 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),HR-V is a great choice!, Really happy with the quality and value given cost.   Odd it doesn't have an auxiliary port for the phone but connects thru Bluetooth which is fine.   No Sat radio unless you have the Nav pkg but the Sirius phone app allows me to access Sat radio.   Wonder what purpose the HDMI port really serves??  Sort of wish the EX had electric seat adjustment for driver's seat but all in all given cost I am extremely happy with my choice of the HR-V.    If you decide on getting extended warranty do not jump at the 1st offer.   It is negotiable for sure.  Updated after 7 months of ownership:   still really happy with the vehicle on all counts.   Now that I am used to the interior and touch screen features I have improved that rating.   The key fob is extremely convenient and now that I am used to it can't imagine being without one.,5

When I was out of town battery went dead when door locks would not quit continuously locking and unlocking.   The seat leather is not quality passenger seat has a small imperfection where leather is pulling apart and I rarely have a passenger except for my purse in the passenger seat. I am dissatisfied with the dealership putting me off on these issues for a year now.  Updating I no longer own the HRV, traded it in at Delaney Honda in Indiana Pa.  The dealership was very friendly, competent and made my purchase and trading in the HRV a pleasure and exciting they are definitely worth the drive if you don’t live close.   Delaney Honda informed me that I did have extended warranty on the HRV that I traded in and I was due a full refund of my extended warranty purchased which I was told by Valley Honda, Monroeville Pa that I did not have and would have to pay for all repairs.  I followed up at Valley Honda with sales Manager to get my full refund of the extended warranty I purchased.

2155, on 03/17/17 10:30 AM (PDT),MG Brown ,2017 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Consider the HR-V for your second or third car.," It is just slightly a month after delivery of our Honda HR-V EX AWD.There were certain dealer-installed options that we wanted, and we found after using the ‘build your Honda’ tool on their website, that installation and other required installation kits were not included in the price of the options. This raised the price considerably and was a bit of a sticker shock. If you are planning to have options installed, check the price of labor, etc. on the Honda e-store for a more realistic bottom line price.Speaking of dealer installation charges, shop around before buying or ordering your HR-V. We saved a substantial amount of money buying either OEM or third party accessories from eBay and Amazon. I feel anyone can ‘install’ a rear cargo tray or floor mats so why pay the dealer’s labor charge for something that you can do yourself?We feel that the HR-V is a good choice for a second or third car (our case) for a small family or a childless couple. In many ways, the HR-V is a throwback to when families had a low-end station wagon as a second car for hauling people or cargo. With the price being what it is- I can imagine some young families looking at the LX model for an only car. I'm not sure if the HR-V is the best choice for an only car so I'd advise people such as that to shop around.Honda surprised us by including some features as standard on the HR-V that I would consider to be luxury oriented and not including some features that I would call practical in nature. For example- both of our other cars have push button memory seats (not available in the HR-V) which is extremely helpful if you have 2-3 people who drive all of the cars.As with most Hondas made in the last 20 years or so, major options are by package so if you want XM satellite radio, you have no choice but to pay for leather seating and navigation also. It’s a shame that you can’t pick and choose more features but I assume it’s that way to keep costs down.I read other reviewers complaining about driver positioning; I can only assume that they have not read their owners manual because our EX model has tilt and telescope steering wheel as well as seat height and backrest tilt adjustments. I am a tall guy but with some adjusting, I can get reasonably comfortable in the HR-V driver compartment.My only interior complaint is that both driver and passenger seating areas have an encroachment by the front wheel well into the interior which pushes back my left leg when driving or right leg when I am the passenger by about an inch. This is just enough to be slightly uncomfortable when driving but less so when I am the passenger. If you are tall or have a long inseam, this may be a consideration for you too.Others have complained about the HR-V’s engine performance; I believe that Honda changed the engine mapping for 2017 and our AWD version gets down the road nicely. I can’t imagine anyone buying an HR-V expecting it to be a rocket. We feel the power and torque are more than adequate and at the same time it delivers good to great fuel economy.The AWD on our HR-V proved its worth after the first heavy snowfall in our area and unless you are really on a tight budget, I’d certainly suggest you get the AWD version.We had another car in the past with a CVT automatic and the HR-V has some of the same characteristic transmission and power train noise that the other car had. It’s a shame because most Honda automatics are relatively quiet.I have heard that some people have complained about Honda not including Apple Play or the Android equivalent in the HR-V. We feel that the HondaLink system included in the EX is all that we need and quite easy and intuitive to use. I understand the infotainment system in the LX is different so perhaps those that have complained have the LX.Our HR-V is a fun and versatile vehicle. The various cargo configurations such as ‘long mode’ and the magic seats in the 2nd row make for a lot of options when transporting stuff from here to there.We have found the HR-V to be a crossover that does almost everything well; it is very practical and economical as well as having a handsome appearance without too much glitz and gadgetry.",4

Along with Honda's history of vehicle reliability, I picked the HR-V for the following reasons:  It's a great looking vehicle with great mpg.  (I am averaging 36 mpg on each tank of gas and I expect that to get better!)  It's very reasonably priced for a vehicle that has heated seats, a backup camera, a right turn lane/signal camera, push start and a moon roof.

I looked around and had never heard of the HR-V until I was looking at a CR-V and remarked to the salesman that it was bigger than I wanted. He asked if I had looked at the HR-V. He had one. I looked it over and the salesman and I took a test drive. It had the magic seats that I really liked in the Fit. It was bigger, which I was looking for, quieter, nicer ride, etc. The features were excellent although the USB, HDMI, and 12 volt power supply are inconveniently located. At the time I was driving my F150. I took it home and came back with my Fit. I then took the HR-V for a ride by myself. I took it home and got my wife and we went for a ride, curvy road, highway, etc. I just had to have it back before the dealership closed. This was a Saturday. I bought it the next week. I just returned from a trip where I drove from Arkansas to Maryland and back. I have no regrets. The car performed fine in every respect, ride, comfort, mileage, etc. The automatic climate control is wonderful. I filled up in Cumberland, MD and stopped for the night in Morehead, Kentucky with still about a third of a tank of gas. I filled up when I left Morehead and had a third of a tank or so when I got home. I used the Honda Nav app that I downloaded to my IPhone as my GPS. I carried my regular GPS along just in case. The Honda Nav App was great. A $60.00 down load, an HDMI cable, a lightning adapter from Best Buy, and a USB charge cord for the IPhone to keep the phone charged and forget the regular GPS. It runs through the 7"" display. I am extremely pleased with the HR-V, price, features, ride, everything. I had no problems in the mountains in West Virginia or Maryland. I mostly left it on economy the whole trip until I hit the mountains and then I turned it off for the the extra power. Car did fine.I now have approximately 16k miles on it. Have had it about 54 weeks. I have taken it to northern Illinois, Maryland 4 times, and Florida once. I am extremely happy with the HRV. I will be taking it to south Dakota soon. Note, it cruised the SD 80 mph speed limit with no problem and I have had no problems in the mountains with it. I basically set economy on and left it. Very seldom do I take it out of economy.I had my 2016 HRV EX for approximately 14 months. I put approximately 18,800 miles on it. I had no complaint with the car at all. I traded it in about 5 months ago on a 2017 HRV EX-L-Navi-AWD.  The main reason I traded was I wanted an AWD. I took it to northern Illinois over Christmas. I cannot say anything negative about the HRV at all. Even with the upgrade to AWD it still gets good mileage, although I did drop some from the 2 wheel drive, but then that is to be expected. The HRV goes about 10,000 miles between oil changes. For me it has been a great car. I wanted something bigger than the Fit but smaller than the CRV. The HRV fit the bill perfectly. It rides and handles well. Acceleration is very adequate but it is not a race car. The acceleration, even on mountains is very adequate. I have run mountains in Arkansas, Kentucky, Maryland, West Virginia, and South Dakota. In my opinion they are great cars. Just returned from a 12 day trip to Arizona. Have also taken the 2017 HRV to northern Illinois and Maryland. Will be going to Maryland again, likely within the next 3 weeks. I love the car. It is plenty big and comfortable for two people to travel in. We also have a Honda Cross Tour. It is a very nice car also. We used it for trips until I got the HRV. Now we use the HRV for trips. If we were traveling with more than just my wife and I we would use the Cross Tour but the HRV is perfectly fine for two people to travel in. Plenty of room for our stuff, plus souvenirs and stuff we pick up along the way.",5

2160, on 07/01/18 21:10 PM (PDT),Rebecca ,2016 Honda HR-V  EX-L w/Navigation 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Love my honda!," I got this little SUV because I had a jeep liberty and wanted something that still sat up off the ground a bit, had the storage of my jeep, and still felt ""sporty"" but was better on gas.  Few things I love about this car. One the gas on it is amazing I live in Hawaii and although it's a small island I still drive quite a bit and I dont fill up but once every 2 weeks sometimes even longer. The seats sit up higher than a sedan so I still feel like I can see my surroundings and it's pretty easy to get in and out of. I'm not climbing to get in nor am I squatting to get down in it. Perfect combination. I love how this car handles the road. It hugs every curve you go through and switches lanes with ease. Which brings me to the right side mirror. Mine has the side view so u can see into the other lane by a camera on your radio, which I thought at first I would never use but I'm almost half dependent on it now. I dont feel like theres too many blind spots when checking over my shoulders to switch lanes either which is nice. The driverside mirror doesnt come with the lane watch but there is a small section already built in so you can see what's over there. The storage is great I love that I can choose to flip my rear seats up and they will stay that way as long as the bar is tucked down allowing for way more space for taller objects. The back seats also fold down completely flat and makes the entire trunk space get at least 1/3rd bigger. I'm about 5'10"" and feel like I could sleep back there. That also brings me to the room in the car. Being this tall I didnt want a car that I would feel cramped I and I have plenty of head clearance.   The back seats also have plenty of leg room so us tall people can fit wherever in this car. The heated seats are awesome too (eventually I'll use them again) but they were amazing in the winter time with the different settings for it. The speakers and radio functions are decent as well. I'm not 18 anymore and dont care to have a ""system"" in my car but this little thing will give you just the right amount of bass if your desire it. Also the radio functions are super easy to figure out. Easy to pair bluetooth with and easy to customize the color scheme to what you may want. The screen is also a touch screen and fairly sensitive so your not spending half of your time mashing your radio to get it to work. There are multiple charging options in this little car too which can prove to be more amazing than not so if you just have a USB or a actual car charger theres a place to plus your phone in about 3 total I do believe and that's just the front. The rear backup camera sits low to the ground so you can actually see where your going and dont feel like your backing up a truck. Which I have seen in other cars. So i personally feel more confident when using it. Although the backup camera is great theres a few things i would improve on it. Theres no beeping to indicate your getting close to something. There is colors showing if your in the clear or not but a beep would be nice. Also I've seen in other cars where it will help you back straight in and your car wont be half sideways. Not the case with this camera. As long as your wheels are straight it says your straight. I would fix that. The headrest are also very comfortable, it's like they have been lined with memory foam almost. One of my favorite features. So now some of the the things I dont like or would change. This is a small car and isnt meant to go 0 to 60 in 3 seconds. If your going up a hill and trying to get around a car super fast your gonna tell your car isnt up for that but other than that I have no problem it accelerates just fine to me other than getting up a hill super fast. The windshield is a little long for me but then again I'm coming from a jeep to a small SUV. And last con would be the break hold. I very VERY rarely use it. It works as its suppose to I just think it's really a useless feature that the car has. Overall I love my honda and even though I settled with this car (I wanted a Mazda cx5) I'm happy I did. I feel safe and can see all around in the car and I dont get the urge to mash the gas and go (which wouldnt really work to well in the first place) so if your 16 and its your first car or 26 and you need a family car or 96 and need something more for you I think that the honda HRV is a all around win. Sporty enough to suit the weekenders who wander but still safe and family enough to suit everybody else. Buy the car you wont be disappointed.",5

Lots of versatility in  cargo configurations.   The Magic Seat is great!  Very smooth ride and good pick up but if you need a little more, you just put it in the Sport Gear and Go!  This was a 2 year old car but an upgrade from my 2007 Dodge Caliber.  I didn't want a lot of extras on this car, that is why I chose the LX not the EX.

Not real comfortable for long trips, an hour or more, electronics hard to work, you have to hit the screen with much pressure to make it work. other than that the HRV is a decent car even though it's feel is not the usual Honda quality feel and if this is your first new Honda, you will probably like it. This is my 16th New Honda since 89 so I expect a lot from Honda and this one ranks low for me. Maybe because it was assembled in Mexico.",4

Blind spot camera is cool although I haven't used it much. Small, Reliably, affordable, and a great first car. Also gets good fuel economy (about 30 mpg with the car in eco mode half the time) and only takes $20 to fill up the tank when almost empty (June 2017). Heated seats are nice when cold. Ample storage for gear and groceries. Only real complaint would be that there are no LED lights on the vehicle what so ever (I know I'm picky). All in all great car, perfect for kids/young adults and easy to park.",4

2169, on 05/25/17 06:00 AM (PDT),Patrick ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Good at being adequate," I purchased a 2016 Honda HR-V LX AWD as my family's secondary vehicle which I occasionally use for work.  I had previously owned a Jeep Renegade that I absolutely loved and my wife had a 2015 Subaru Crosstrek.  (we traded in both our Renegade and a Subaru Crosstrek for a Jeep Grand Cherokee as we wanted something bigger and I had a company car at the time - then I switched jobs and lost the company car, so we needed something ASAP).  My primary reason for getting the HR-V vs. the Renegade or Crosstrek was that for an equally equipped Crosstrek, I was looking at about $25,000, and for an equally equipped Renegade about $27,000.  The HR-V came in at $22,500 sticker price.  I liked the styling of the HR-Vs I had seen on the road, went by the Honda Dealership and got a great deal on a left-over 2016.  I am now about 3,000 miles into owning the vehicle and my experience has been ... adequate.  There is nothing overly exciting about the HR-V.  It isn't a bad looking vehicle, but it isn't an eye catcher.  It just kind of is what it is.  I enjoy the handling of the HR-V, it is great for tight parking lots, around town and city traffic driving. There is a zippy, go-cart feel to the HR-V, reminiscent of driving around my old 1987 Honda Prelude I had in college.  It is also surprisingly solid on the highway and has a solid, upright seating position that feels surprisingly like a real SUV (vs. complaints I always had with my wife's Crosstrek which felt unsecure on the highway and I felt like I was sitting on the floor).  I have never had an issue with acceleration.  I constantly see complaints about acceleration in other people's reviews.  Ok, if you're looking for a sports car, this isn't it.  But one thing I feel everyone overlooks is that if you want better acceleration, there is a ""sport mode"" you can put the HR-V in which gives you just that at the expense of some MPG.  The cargo / storage versatility of the vehicle is its high point as there is a lot of cargo space when the seats are down.  The ""Magic Seats"" are a cool car showroom gimmick but I honestly have never used them nor do I see a need to.  I have not yet had the opportunity to drive in bad winter conditions.    Ok, now to the negatives:  The MPG is not at all what I had hoped for.  The Renegade I had averaged about 26 MPG mixed use, and my wife's Crosstrek averaged about 31.  I am in 3000 miles right around 26 with 90% highway driving, sport mode off and eco mode on.  I will get 30-31 on a straight highway trip, but I am not impressed considering the Renegade got that, and in the Crosstrek we would be at 40+ mpg with straight highway driving.  I did not have either of those vehicles long enough to ""break them in"" either (both had around 10,000 miles when we traded them in, and I was getting that kind of gas mileage from the start).  So I would say the HR-V falls short in terms of MPG.  Also, the back seat is just plain awful.  Yes, there is good leg room and head room (awesome actually), but the seat design is uncomfortable.  The head reads fold down into the seat to provide the driver with better rear views.  If you have someone sit in the back seat, you have to pull the head rests up.  The seat back is still very low with the head rest providing most of your upper back support.  It has a jump seat feel to it .. it might work for kids, but as a 5'10, 200 lb. adult, I found it to be very uncomfortable.  Another complaint is that there are cheap materials throughout the vehicle.  The deck of the cargo area is practically felted cardboard.  I purchased the OEM cargo trey/liner which was not any better.  The carpeted floor mats the vehicle came with are cheap so I purchased weather tech mats.  My number 1 complaint is that with the LX non-leather version I have, the door sills are upholstered with fabric instead of a wipe able surface.  This means that if it is raining and you open the door, it gets soaked.  Since its fabric, it holds the moisture.  I had to exit my vehicle in a parking lot downpour and the door became completely soaked.  I am concerned how this will hold up over time.  I also feel that Honda could have done better with the ground clearance. I bought a crossover AWD vehicle to handle NE Ohio snowstorms, beach driving, and the occasional camp road or muddy event parking field.  With 6.7"" ground clearance there is no chance for beach driving.  Yes, I knew this going into buying the vehicle ... but considering the HR-V's competitors all have 8+"" of ground clearance, I feel like they missed the mark.  I have scraped the underside of the nose on some parking space curbs - in my opinion that shouldn't happen with a crossover.  Hopefully with the next generation HR-V, Honda will have made these small little tweaks which would turn an adequate crossover into a great one.  By then, I'll probably have traded it in for a Renegade or Crosstrek.",4
2170, on 05/22/17 14:33 PM (PDT),Brian ,2016 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl 6M),HR-V not worth it," I bought a 2016 HR-V in December 2015. I drove it for 18 months and put 30,000 miles on it. This car is a big rattle trap! Driver seat squeaking, rattles from the rear end, rattles from the dash, rattles from the sunroof, and several more that I care not to get into. It didn't matter if the road was smooth or bumpy, the issues were prevalent. I finally had enough and traded it for a 2017 Honda Civic EX-T Coupe. I figured that since my daughter has a 2016 Civic EX-T sedan since December 2015 with excellent gas mileage and no issues, I would give the Civic a try. So far, I LOVE IT!",2

They took it out for a ""test drive"" and the ""service guy"" said he didn't feel any vibration and suggested that it was a new car, tight suspension, etc etc. Car was fine in his opinion.

2177, on 01/27/17 10:18 AM (PST),Valerie ,2016 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),from Civic to HRV, I ABSOLUTELY love this car. I was very hesitant at first because I just wanted to replace my civic that was totaled in a car accident. My husband kept saying just test drive it and see. I mean I loved the look but said no. Well when I started to look at the civics and don't know if it was me or that they seemed to be lower than the one I had. So I went to look at the CRV. Still not even looking in the HRV's direction. Test drove the CRV and I was like OK I can do this. But still on the fence. I am only 4 foot 11 so I felt the CRV was a bit on the big side. I was really stuck. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis so getting a civic was not out of the question. When I have flares it would be hard for me to get in and out of the car because it was just to low. The CRV seemed to be the better fit but finally the salesman was like lets just take a look at the HRV. I think it's what you are looking for. When I went to sit in the HRV let me tell you. It fit like a glove. The ease of getting in and out of the car was so easy. My kids have plenty of room in the back seat. I have great space in my cargo area. I mean this car is perfect. It drives great. I did read about the speed and it drives great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Now let me get to the few thinks I don't really care for but deal with because like I said I love this car.  The cup holder is not that great. If you have a medium drink or larger you are good. but if you have a small drink the lift for that size is not very promising. I find myself holding the cup because I feel it will fall out of the cup holder.  The middle console armrest is pretty small. maybe a few pens.  Where they have put the charging plugs in the front is OK but i would much rather have easier access.  Now this is one think I don't understand. The passenger can usually lock the car if the driver happens to step out when parked. But you can't in this car. They have to lean over to the driver's side to lock the car. (If someone knows how it can be done please let me know)  The problems I see are so minor that I tell everyone that asks me about my HRV to go and test drive it and they will see for themselves this is a great car.,5
2178, on 01/27/17 09:50 AM (PST),TheGuySubmittingThisReview ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),HRV exceeds expectations.. Until you use the radio," I got this car out of college, coming from my parent's 2006 Lexus RX330 (it was old but it was a tank, befitting of a 16 year old). Most of my driving in cities, taking trips under 5 miles. Turn radius is excellent, you'll think you're in a smaller car. Parking-including parallel, is a breeze. Both cameras are excellent, the backup has a wide view so you can see the periphery and lanewatch lets you change lanes without turning your head. Brake hold is amazing, and I don't know why this wasn't a feature decades ago. I can actually take my foot off the brake at a stoplight and not worry. In the city, I averaged about 13mpg in the RX(rated 16). In the HRV I average about 24 (rated 27). Taking road trips (~65mph), I would average about 24 in the RX (rated 22), and I get about 33 in the HRV (Rated 31). I'm averaging 27 for the life of the car (9months, 8k miles). The best I've gotten on the highway is 36 after driving about 2 hours at 65mph. 2WD mileage is likely better. Acceleration is fine. It's not as fast as my family's now illegal Jetta TDI, but it's comparable to the RX. I've never had problems passing on the highway; it's just not impressive if you ever go pedal to the metal. Acceleration is improved in sport mode (keeps the engine at a higher RPM), but you lose about 5mpg. As for ECO mode, I've noticed AC it gets severely nerfed. If you live somewhere warm you'll want to keep ECO off. In cruise control, ECO mode is also lackluster. Resuming to 65mph from a full stop at a stoplight took about 25 seconds-in this time 18 cars passed me on the left. I didn't know why it was so slow until I turned ECO mode off-suddenly cruise control accelerated at an acceptable rate. It's fine if you're maintaining speed, but if you have to slow down or come to stops on a long trip, you'll want to turn ECO off. I also haven't noticed a significant increase in efficiency in ECO mode; at best it might be 1-2mpgs. For the interior, space is great. I'm 6' and it's ""almost"" tight, I have the seat as low as possible, but I still fit comfortably. Backseat space is excellent. Easily fits 5+carry-ons. Magic seats are excellent. I was able to fit an entire queen bed frame (disassembled) in the car by folding the seats down. Every time I'm packing a ton of stuff I'm amazed by how much space this car has; sometimes I wonder if there's some voodoo going on. Interior build quality is excellent. I have the cloth seats (leather was not work $4k to me), and I appreciate the soft touch materials. It makes it a lot more comfortable than than the hard plastic materials in the jetta. The fo-leather on the dash looks stylish. It's hysterical to watch some new passengers try to figure out where the back door handles are. My biggest issue is the entertainment controls. They are terrible. TERRIBLE. Changing sources takes 2-4 touchscreen presses, and some buttons are so small you have to take your eyes off the road to look. Climate controls are slightly better since it's black on white, which is easier to see in your peripheral. Still not great. I find myself relying on the steering wheel controls to control volume and other audio functions. That's not a story of ""Great! The steering buttons work fantastic!""; it's a story of ""The touchscreen is so bad that I'm taking every opportunity to avoid it"". It's also unintuitive-I find it easier to change something myself than explain the layout to a passenger. I did buy a phone mount that snaps onto the air vent and offers wireless charging to my phone, and I connect over bluetooth. That works like a charm, and it lets me easily change audio sources within my phone (podcast republic, pandora, spotify, etc) and use google maps. Connecting my wireless charger, I did notice one big drawback-the ports. My EX comes equipped with a car outlet, two USB ports, and a HDMI input. first off, the HDMI is worthless. It lets you pump something to the display, but only when the car is stopped. I don't see any point in connecting something like a laptop to a SMALLER screen. If you want it for the audio, just use bluetooth. The USB ports don't provide enough power to charge a cell phone. They're meant for data only (mp3 hookup). This perplexes me both because EVERYONE is going to try to charge their cell phone from those ports, and NO ONE is in a scenario where they'll benefit from 2 MP3 hookups. I dunno what they were thinking, and I had to get a usb adapter for the power socket. In conclusion, this is a great car for the city and highway. I just got my first oil change, and have had no maintenance or repair issues other than the tow hook cover coming off in a wash ($100? really?). It gives you headroom without sacrificing MPGs. The electronics need some redesigning for usability, but for its price point, the HRV is a 9/10, magical automobile. Give me android auto and it'll be a 10/10.",5

I have low standards, however, I got this car for my daughter, thinking that Honda reliability will make us be worry free for the next few years. First issue, front windshield blurry in the bottom inch before the dashboard, hey, what can you do , its not perfect, its a $21000 dollar vehicle, not gonna bring it to the dealership to replace it, we can live with that. Second issue , no engine temperature gauge, I mean come on now, how hard can it be for Honda to put that in, okay , I guess we can just get a scan gauge to remedy the issue. Third issue, its been raining here in Los Angeles, the past few days, and guess what? the rear passenger side has some leaks ,primarily the seat belt is soaking wet, aside from that the trunk has leaks too, in the same side. I mean, wow , this is supposed to be Honda...what happened to your quality control.?I've only had the HRV for 6 months, at 6300 miles, garage kept . pampered and babied like my other old Hondas..Now I have to bring it the dealerships here in L.A. I'm not sure how long they will fix it or not and they might not even offer a loaner car, I think, hope i'm wrong ...what a disappointment. Imagine the molds that may be in those wet areas ...Now i'm stuck with this HRV, can't wait to get rid of it....",1

2181, on 01/16/17 17:46 PM (PST),Pam ,2016 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Economy air and heating," My biggest problem with the HRV was the heating and cooling system. I drove for over an hour with the AC on max and it felt like I had a fan blowing in my face. It never got cool. If the temp is over 80 be ready to sweat. The dealership told me it was an economy car with an economy heating/cooling system. And they totally correct!! The heater would eventually heat up but the the air was never cool. I kept it on max at all times. Test it on a hot day, with the car sitting in the sun and you will have a good example of how poorly the system works. If you just need a car without air then it's great, got great gas mileage. But I had to get rid of mine, burned up or froze 9 months out of the year",2

What you will realize after driving for a while is that the seat will cause back pain.  It is because the seat tips backward a bit.  No matter how you adjust it, it will be uncomfortable.  If you like sitting up straight - don't buy this car.",1
2184, on 01/04/17 07:26 AM (PST),zy ,2016 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Not a Bad Car But Not a Great Car....," This is a very Mediocre car.  The Good is it was under $25K done with the joke...  ($24,995).   The interior wasn't designed for people who like pockets for stuff like your sun - glasses, purse and or ?  Other women have said the same thing.   The console needs to be redesigned and it will be...   Love the backseat manipulation designed * why I bought the car.    Disappointments, yes more than one:  1) How bad it handles in snow for a 4 wheel crossover, 2) lack of Power even for a little old lady... 3) Hatch back sticks and no option for auto release or shut (old school manual shut) If you can get it open!!!!    4) HONDA SERVICE  minus 10 company doesn't care.   5) Mileage is low more in the 25 in city.   6) Service at the Honda Dealer in Westminster, CO  once you've got the car it's your problem.  Next car won't be a Honda already looking at the New Mazda 3X after only 18 month driving this car.  Think hard Is Honda going on the past history and not living up to their  promises.   All good things come to an end.......Only thing IT IS Better is the Subaru Crosstreck which we all know is Subaru's mistake.",3

The oil gets bad fast and i have to change it too often.  I can`t stand the brakes on this vehicle, very poor acceleration, I feel the transmission on this car is no good at all. Ac does not cool enough, the car gets hot in minutes. The brakes make a strange sound and i can feel as if it hit my foot as I press the brakes.  I don`t feel safe at all.  Also the interior looks very nice but I only have this vehicle for ten months and the seats look like a five year old car.  The sound from the outside, inside the vehicle is too loud.  When I am driving I feel like if the windows are open when they are all close.  If I am park any sound from outside is heard clear inside the vehicle, sometimes people close their vehicle doors park behind me and I can hear like if someone hit my car with something.   I definitely want to give this car back and get my money.  I paid around $35,000.00 for this car and is not worth half of it.",1
2186, on 12/19/16 10:20 AM (PST),Jay schickling ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Nice little car with a few shortcomings," I was coming from an 07 rav 4 with 2 wheel drive.  I have bounced back and forth between compact vehicles to SUVs.  I was looking for the fuel economy of a smaller vehicle, with the safety and AWD options of an SUV.  Aside from Subarus, the options were scarce.  I'm disappointed Toyota doesn't have an option, and was excited about the upcoming Toyota CHR, but after learning it will not have an AWD drivetrain, it didnt meet my criteria.  (I'm not sure why Toyota would do that).  I also considered Mazda's cx-3 which looked promising on paper, but it had a very hatchback feel and drove extremely low to the ground.    I found the HRV to have the best blend of what I was looking for and is the first vehicle I've seen that truly ""feels"" like a small SUV inside of its cabin, but offers the drive-ability and fuel economy of a compact sedan.  The cabin has plenty of space and feels like my RAV4, but it handles like a car and has very responsive steering.  No issues with traction of AWD which are requisites in a north-eastern climate.  The vehicles continuously variable transmission takes a little while to get used to, and its admittedly under-powered.  I didn't find it straining to accelerate on the highway or anything highly noticeable, but its not peppy.  The cabin noise was less than my RAV-4 and I'm hoping that doesn't change as the vehicle ages.  The stock soundsystem and screen in the LX model are garbage and I will replace with an aftermarket headunit and integrate the factory back up camera and steering controls into that unit.   Overall I'm satisfied with the vehicle, its pretty much what I expected it to be, and was the only option on the market I found to meet all of my criteria to some degree.  My biggest disappointment was the factory warranty being slightly shorter than industry standard, and the dealer trying to push a third party warranty from zurich.  I'm guessing with Honda's reputation for reliability, the warranty is less of a concern from the manufacturers side.  I cant yet speak to reliability or cost of ownership.",4
2187, on 12/07/16 12:14 PM (PST),Skye ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),"’16 Honda HRV, not bad, just good"," After stalking and researching this vehicle for a year since its release in summer 2015, I finally own it… well it is financed. I must say I enjoy the car and everyone that has the opportunity to ride along with me always ask – is this a Honda CRV and always entertained or thinks the rear door handle location is pretty cool. PROS** Fueling up is easy on the purse ** Space is more than sufficient for my 2 French Mastiffs or 3 adults and I.** Miles per gallon is average on these Atlanta street and highways. I have not really got to the 33 mph, most I can get when oil quality is 50% of better is 28.6 MPG and when oil is at 40%  27.7 MPG.** Bluetooth feature a plus, connects to my phone without any issues. ** Navigating out of a small space – exceptional – turning radius is on point.CONS** Headlights illumination is not great when traveling up a slight to extreme incline; visibility covers about 5-10 feet ahead of your vehicle (could be more). The directional of the light appears more downward toward the pavement illuminating right below the license plate/bumper area if other vehicle.  ** Seats are moderately comfortable but would not recommend for long distance road trips if you have back issues.** Extremely bouncy on poorly paved roads ** USB port is not compatible with my android phone and it cannot be used as a charge port for mobile devise.** Cabin noise is horrible on certain areas of the HWY in Atlanta when traveling 50 ++ mph, sounds like all the windows are down but in actuality all the windows are rolled up. ** Lining through the back of vehicle (floor panels) cheap. At the end of it all, it is mine and I will make the best of it but there is definitely room for improvement.",4

My negative comment is not enough storage compartments in the front.",5
2189, on 11/27/16 18:34 PM (PST),Brandy Mull ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),"Fell in Love, Still in Love!"," When Honda came out with the new HR-V I fell in love. And I am not a Honda fan. I'm a loyal Toyota girl. I had a RAV4, but just felt ""blah"" about it. I love the gas miliage on my honda, I'm averaging 28 mpg & less than $20 to fill her up. Her engine is not quiet by any means & the ride is not smooth. I reminds of you of driving a small truck, but FUN to drive! I'm 5'0 ft tall and I feel like this car is the SUV for us short gals! Easy to get in & out of , my 5 yr old has trouble reaching the door handle, but climbing in & out is getting easier for her. I do want to say this, in regards to safety. I had a car literally slam on their brakes in front of me a few days ago & got to use the anti-lock brakes for the first time! And all I can say is WOW!!! The stop was immediate, we all slung forward but we had our seatbelts on so all was well. I was VERY impressed by the braking system in an emergency, esp since I had my 3 kids in the car! The back seat is not comfortable with the head rests, so my kids removed the backseat headrests the day we bought it. Other than that, I give my car 5 stars! I will say the Bluetooth in my Toyota's worked ALOT better....but I still wouldn't trade my HR-V for a RAV! And it won't let me change it, but my HRV is EX model. I've had my car almost a year now & still love it. I literally get compliments daily on my car from folks I don't know, that says a lot about this car.",5
2190, on 11/21/16 21:00 PM (PST),KW ,2016 Honda HR-V  EX-L w/Navigation 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Perfect AWD Size; saving me $$ at the pump!," Love the size of this AWD Honda, great on gas, sits up higher than a car and has the peace of mind that Honda and AWD offers.  Nice cargo space with the hatch back but lacks a little change compartment/ limited on storage compartments in the front or back seat area.  The biggest disappointment thus far is the lack of technology----let me explain.  The navigation system does not seem to ""re-route"" you if you take a different road?  My phone seems to do a better job and I would really like the car nav to be just as good if not better because of the large screen and the sound throughout my car--very disappointed.  It would be nice if they would have an update and also install on the 2016 models too.  Another disappointment is that it can not read text messages from I phones!!??  Or emails or even email notifications!!  Very disappointed once again....perhaps Honda will send out a recall for all of us to go in for a system update?""  Another feature that seems a little clunky is the voice prompts?  But perhaps I just need more practice?  Overall I really do love this vehicle and I think it is a great value.  I would just like to see Honda offer a few more bells and whistles like a heated steering wheel and a remote control start app that I can start my car from anywhere not having to be so close in case I am in the long check out line at the grocery store.  I know the other ladies know where I am coming from especially those of us who live in cold weather!!  The last option on my wish list for Honda would be to add the built in  ""booster seat"" like some other high quality/safety car companies do.  It makes it so nice and convient no matter who you are taking along for a ride.",5
2191, on 11/21/16 02:39 AM (PST),Clarence S. ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),HR-V--OVERALL GOOD BUT...," Good overall value. Interior space and layout good. My LX model has fewer tech features, just essential items, nothing fancy, no sunroof to leak, etc. Suspension needs improvement. Ride on delivery date was very rough and bouncy. Ride home was about 25 mi, let tires cool overnite, found tire press to be 35 psi on all tires. Placard reads 32psi front, 30 psi rear. Reset  tire press and ride improved slightly. Still too rough riding for a new car. Leased my suv 7/21/16, has 2000 mi as of 11/19/16. Currently, ride seems to be a little smoother, but still too rough/bouncy for a new car. Air cond seems under powered, cools but slowly and takes awhile to really cool car. I live in Hawaii and local temp is on avg- < 90 degrees. Tires are Michelins, which ride rough and are a little noisy at freeway speeds < 60 mph. I want to replace the michelins with goodyears for a smoother ride but its a lease car (3yrs/36,000 mi) so no sense buying another set of tires. However, if I had ""Bought"" the car, I definitely would sell the Michelins and get some Goodyears. After reading several buyer reviews about other service issues, poor dealer response, etc., I am glad I only have to deal with possible probs for 3 yrs, then turn in the car at lease end.  Overall, the hr-v is a good value except for the poor ride. With my low expected annual mileage, I may not experience the range of issues reported by other owners. I did get an ""Excess wear/tear"" warr to cover me when I turn in the suv.  I definitely would look at the mitsubishi outlander as a replacement suv.  So, I hope I don't have probs or service issues like other owners. If things change, I will definitely update this review. So far, no probs. Perhaps a 3-yr lease/rtn is best. Keeping my fingers crossed for no probs!!",4
2192, on 11/18/16 16:55 PM (PST),CJ Mund ,2016 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Another Great One From Honda," I had a 2011 CR-V and thought about trading it in for Crosstour. I'm glad that I waited, because I purchased the HR-V this year, and it is a classic Honda vehicle.  The thing I love about the HR-V, other than it's roominess, is the fact that it actually feels beefy. I was not expecting to sit up so high, but there really is pretty good clearance on this thing. We also own a Fit, and there is considerable height difference in the two.  I recently drove it in downtown Seattle, and the thing can turn on a dime.  The handling and the drive are wonderful.  The Fit has such bad road noise, so I was hoping the HR-V wouldn't follow suite, and it doesn't.  It's very quite at 70 and even 75 mph. I have been getting about 33 mph on my commute to and from work. Overall, I love this car. I don't see too many of them on the road yet, so a lot of people will stop and ask me what kind of car it is. Love it.",5

The head rest on the driver seat tilts your head forward and cannot be adjusted.   Absolutely no lower back support or adjustment ability to the lower back driver seat.  So many corners cut to cut costs on this thing.  If it was 12k I might give it more stars, but for 24k, no way!  No cupholders in the backseat. No side storage space in the back hatch section.  Left-hand driver side armrest is rock hard and uncomfortable as hell.  No knobs on dashboard controls make it very difficult and awkward to adjust the music and climate controls.   A few positives with this car would be good gas mileage comfortable right arm rest for the driver seat and the right turn lane camera. Gutless motor and no legroom for the driver made this a bad choice for me and l'm pissed I bought it.  I had to eat my loss and trade it back.",1

I needed the AWD and reliablity for New England winters. The HRV filed the segment I was looking at very well. I have always liked the reliability and style of Honda and Acura. I looker at the Madza CX-3 and CX-5. They were sportier but cost of ownership and reliabilty was higher. The CX-3 interior was too small and unfinished for my taste. The CX-5 was more than I wanted to spend. The very happy medium was the HRV. The safety and AWD of the CRV and sportiness of the Civic.,5

The quality of the interior is just superior to other SUVs in the same price range. Mileage is very good, better than most SUVs and it looks very stylish, especially the ""cooper sunset"" a beautiful new color. I love the CR-V EX has a passenger side camera so you can see your blind spot when turning right or just in close city driving.  Also, I love the key-less entry, so that you can have the key in your pocket (or purse ladies) and walk up to the car and grab any handle and the door opens ( big plus when you are carrying a package or it is raining. The 7 inch LCD monitor is bright and easy to see. It is so easy to backup with the larger 7 inch view and the monitor displays yellow curved lines so you and see where you are backing up and the lines change as you turn the steering wheel so you can easily back up between two cars everytime.",5

Take my advice and don't buy these Mexican made junk piles.   I've regretted my purchase since day one.    The selling dealer has been great however;  they can only do so much.   I cannot wait to trade in on better vehicle- and it won't be another Honda.   Now six months later, the exhaust has a terrible rattle under certain speeds when accelerating.

2221, on 07/22/16 11:56 AM (PDT),Kathi Morgan ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Finally got my HR-V!," After wanting an HR-V since summer 2015 (when my CRV reached 170,000 miles), they are finally a bit easier to find.  I purchased an LX, which I absolutely LOVE.  Compared to the other small crossover/suvs in it's class, it sits higher, which is a must after driving an suv for over ten years. It also handles well, (though the ride is a bit rigid), is more spacious inside, and has intuitive controls and technology.  It is my 5th Honda, and they have all been super reliable, and long lasting, with great re-sale value.  After owning my HRV for 5 months, I am still pleased with it overall, but wish I had gotten leather interior instead of cloth.  The cloth on the seats, headrests, and doors is not very high quality, and acts almost like a dirt magnet.  It has also developed a loud squeaking/rubbing sound in the cab which I am having looked at by the dealer soon.  I also wish the headlights were brighter, and the heating/AC system was stronger and more quickly responsive.  I can definitely see/feel the difference in quality from my 2005 CRV EX, but still believe it is a good little car for the money.I have now owned my HRV for 18 months.  I said it all in my 5 month review, though now I wished I had gotten heated seats and side mirror defrosters as well since the heater is not super strong and takes awhile to warm me and the car up.  I assume because of the smallish engine.  The squeaking/rubbing sound has resolved itself (?) so that's nice.  I would buy this car again, it suits my budget and needs well.  And, sits higher with better visibility than the Mazda 3 or other crossovers in it's class.",4

Naturally, if you live in the country or Iowa you probably should look elsewhere.  Pros: -Looks great-Small turning range-Honda Lane Change (Life Saver)-Honda Back-up camera (Life Saver)-Ample cargo space-Ample Front Row seating (I'm a 5' 11"" big guy and I'm very comfortable in the driver seat)-Bluetooth-Touchpad Climate Control (Some stupid old school Auto Critic argued they missed the knobs.  The thing to remember is the old-school Critics are the Knobs.  Apparently, they never used a Touchpad or Smart Phone.)   -Great Gas mileage (35 mpg on the highway as promised)-SunroofCons: -Honda's Android apps are useless (Don't expect Honda to ever upgrade them to being useful.)-Garmin's Navigation that Honda uses (Honda give it up and just install Android Auto in every Honda so we can all use Google Maps or Wave.)-This is nit-picky but the front windshield wipers are both on the drivers side.  The Passenger wipers uses an exceptionally long arm to wipe the windshield.  Which when it's not running during a rainstorm and you're speeding down the highway it shakes.  Annoying.-Windows could be a bit thicker to keep out the road noise.",5

The acceleration is fine under normal situations.  However, when at a complete stop, if I accelerate quickly, it doesn't respond well or when merging onto the highway...if I press on the gas pedal heavily, it won't move out as quick as I want, but these are rare situations and now I know what to expect.  The interior is quite roomy, seats are comfortable, but manual.  There's plenty of leg room, rear seats can fold down or lifted up for traveling with bulky cargo.  I live in an region where winters are rough on cars.  In traffic, I had to brake quickly and the car just slid.  I was in an area where salt trucks aren't out as often as where I live or maybe they couldn't keep up with the continuously falling snow.   I like listening to music on the radio, unfortunately my car doesn't indicate the names of songs/artists automatically. The manual was not helpful on this subject.

2227, on 06/14/16 16:57 PM (PDT),mike hausner ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl 6M),Base model with 6-speed manual," We wanted a car that we could tow behind our RV.   That said we chose the HR-V with the manual transmission over the CTV automatic.   From a re-sale stand point this may not be a good choice....But I am having too much fun driving this car to care!   The gearbox is easy to shift even though I have never had a ""6-speed"".   When in traffic I sometimes skip a gear, like go from first to third to fifth and sixth.   The engine has good torque down low so as long as you are not giving it a lot of gas it doesn't care.   The cornering ability is great too.   It corners like it's on rails.   I told you I was having fun with this car.   On top of all that it's getting over 31 MPG in combined city / highway driving.The other thing that amazed me was the interior space.   It is tight without being cramped.   I am 6'-1"" and 275 pounds so getting in and out of some cars can be difficult for my 70+ year old bones.   However I can easily get in the front or back seat and have plenty of head room.   The EX and EX-L models have a sunroof which takes away some headroom so I opted for the LX model.   It is easier to get in and out of than the Honda Odessey I traded in.   The cargo space is very good for a car this size and with the rear seats folded flat it's even bigger.From the outside it looks more like a sport coupe than a 4-door SUV/Crossover.   Most people don't realize it is a four door because the rear door latch is semi-hidden in the C pillar.   All in all I really like this car!",5

Technology was a no-brainer improvement over having none.  I personally hate all constant velocity transmissions (CVT) as I am old school.  This car would be more powerful with a decent 5 speed, but AWD requires the CVT, so AWD won out. Other than the CVT, this is a really innovative vehicle and we both love the back seat configurations for storage space.  If you want small, and you prefer to sit up higher than most sedans, this is the car.  The styling is sexy and sleek with off-road clearance.  The ""transformers"" looking, over-styled Toyota C-HR was just too bizarre looking.  The HR-V was well priced and sporty around town, but no passing gear AT ALL.",5

2233, on 08/29/18 12:04 PM (PDT),jodyk2 ,2018 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Compact SUV Feels Like a Car," I hadn't really planned on buying an SUV as I don't feel that, in a relatively flat state, it's particularly necessary. But, I was tired of not being able to see around the cars next to me at lights and stop signs, so I gave in. I didn't want anything too big, and I wanted it to feel like a car. My immediate previous car was a 2014 Chevrolet Sonic that I inherited, but before that, I had a 2009 Honda Fit. I LOVED the Fit. (The Sonic, not so much, except for the Bluetooth.) So, I was excited to see that Honda had a compact SUV; it felt like coming home. Unfortunately, they did not use 2 of the Fit features I really liked: the numerous cup holders (especially by the vents) and ample cabin storage. The HR-V has only 2 cup holders in the front (but bottle holders in the doors. Very odd.) and virtually no storage, except for a tiny space inside the arm rest. There are USB ports, but they are very awkwardly placed behind the gearshift -- which, for whatever reason, is up rather high. The other annoyances are that, in the non-navigational model, there is no compass. And, for some reason, they chose a dial for the speedometer, rather than digital numbers. The other thing I don't like is that, if you choose to leave the setting so you can see the mpg, you have to be on Trip A; you can't have that paired with the odometer. I also wish it came with lane/backup warning; there is a good backup camera, but it doesn't make a noise if something is in the way. Lane warning is not available on cars for the U.S. And, while I don't find the entertainment system particularly difficult, it is annoying that it ALWAYS displays the safety warning and then all the various choices each time you turn on the car, rather than defaulting to the last screen setting. It will play whatever you last had on, though. Onto good things: First, it came with Michelin tires. My dad was most impressed by that. It gets great mileage: I've consistently gotten 30 mpg in the city, and the rare times I've been on the highway, it's gotten up to 36 mpg. I also like the economy button feature: while some have complained that it makes the car feel sluggish, I don't find that to be the case, although I do turn it off when merging onto a highway, as it will give a little burst of energy. The seats are very comfortable. Shortly after I got the car, a friend and I took a 4 day road trip and neither of us was uncomfortable. The driver's seat adjusts up and down, as well as back & forward & sitting to more reclining. I rather like that the armrest slides, although if you move it up, you lose access to one of the cup holders.  The cup holders are also unique: you can adjust them to be deep for bottles or shallow for cups. There is also ample cargo area storage, and the seats fold into a variety of positions. And, not as important to others but it was to me, the HR-V is nice looking, with its shorter hood and rounded body style.  It feels roomy inside as well. All in all, I am pleased with my purchase. I feel confident in the car's reliability and safety, and I'm amused by its keyless entry and operation.",4

I love the safety features and the convenience of the on-board computer/Bluetooth connection. My only regret is that it did not come with a built in GPS. Why, Toyota?",5
2262, on 04/22/18 09:14 AM (PDT),Richard ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),I bought it ..I like it," Yes it has a 4 cylinder engine. It is not a turbo, It does not pop your neck at acceleration. You want navagation...Get a portable Garmin that talks to you as your drive...can be updated on your computer for life for North America for free. Outside of that, this is a comfortable car, it has eye catching styling. You do have a blind spot on the sides, but if you know how to drive a car, you know how to use a rear view mirror and car outside mirror and use turn indicators to indicate lane switch. I first thought I would not like the review view camera in the mirror, but it really works because you should be looking at the rear view mirror also, and not looking down at a screen. The sensors are great. The interior fabric if taken care of properly will be no problem. I have owned some high dollar cars and some average. This is a car I like to drive...almost compares to my BMW for holding the road and curves. 18# tires make a big difference. You have a sport and Echo setting, which like a hybrid, require you learn to change your driving habits to get max performance. In short, it is a good value for the money and Toyota builds a good car. Go drive one and decide for yourself.",5
2263, on 04/09/18 13:57 PM (PDT),Kate ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),I dont really like this car, Would not recommend this car if your looking for gas saver car. I had my corolla 2017 and decided to trade it to  C-HR 2018 i usually put $30 to my corolla and thats full tank and will last for 5 days even tho im 15miles away from my work still last for 5 days. But when i put $30 to  C-HR it only last for 3 days only. I wish I could bring back my Corolla.,2
2264, on 04/05/18 09:45 AM (PDT),steve ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),"People keep staring, it is eye catching!"," This thing caught my eye and has not failed to impress. All the extras have made this the most fun vehicle i have ever had. I think reviewers who say it has problems accelerating,  haven't put the car in sport mode. in sport mode it flies. The toyota safety package is what sold me on this though, the other comparable crossover suvs dont offer near what toyota has standard here.",5
2265, on 03/11/18 11:14 AM (PDT),Michael White ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),A Flashy and Fun FWD Crossover," Had a chance to do an extended test drive of the Toyota C-HR and found it much better then many of the pundits have rated it. Overall its a very capable FWD crossover with great handling and comfort. I noticed no issues with acceleration and speed at all and found it right in line with any other compact car or SUV. I think the issue is many people see the styling and expect a race car experience when it's really a corolla in a different body. I drive a Mazda CX-3 AWD as my daily commuter and can say the C-HR definitely offers a more comfortable and stylish ride. The only knock I can put on the car is the terrible factory radio (easily replaced) and no hybrid or AWD version here in the US. I would expect both of these options will be added down the road which is why I'll probably wait to purchase one. Bottom line is if you are in the market for a smaller SUV and don't need AWD the C-HR should be one of the first vehicles you look into, it definitely does not disappoint.",4

It looks great,handles and brakes perfectly.The interior is spacious and well designed.Have never had a back seat passenger yet but not much legroom back there.Missing navigation which would be nice but my phone works fine. Overall I am very happy with my ch-r and will probably get another one,but the mileage could be better and the car is under powered and needs a bigger engine to go along with the racey style. Hopefully Toyota will remedy these drawbacks in the future.",4
2268, on 02/14/18 09:41 AM (PST),Y2Flu ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Love it so far," Purchased the radiant green base model. I like to be unique, flashy, eccentric, and flamboyant, and this color definitely stands out in a crowd. I had read some negative reviews regarding its lack of “get up” but I haven’t noticed it. Then again I’ve been driving a Sonata the past four years so I don’t have much to compare it to. The backup camera on the rear view mirror doesn’t bother me either. My only minor qualm is that I wish it had a CD player (I’m old-school) but I know that doesn’t match its modern-ness. Also wanted to note that I’m 6’3”/235 and I fit in it just fine with plenty of room to spare.",5

2270, on 02/07/18 19:09 PM (PST),Jay ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),2 Week Rider," This is a magnificent vehicle.  I went with my mother to purchase a Pirus for her, but she fell in love with the style, price, and comfort of the CHR and got the CHR.  After helping her program and operate certain things on it, I took a liking to it and decided to get one myself.  It’s a big step.  Not only is it my first Toyota, it is my first foreign vehicle.  So far it is already paying for itself with the difference in gas and insurance.  All the neutral ratings I put in were because I have not had it long enough, accept for the acceleration.  The acceleration is not impressive but not weak.  Consider however that this is compared to my Camaro. I rather have the acceleration stay as it is with the same price than have a turbo charged one for thousands more.  This vehicle is also uniquely designed.  Extremely original without a freakish look.  It is the most professional new look I have seen developed in a long time.",5
2271, on 01/09/18 19:09 PM (PST),Jaime ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Will buy again," Kinda slow. But once speed up, you will be surprise how QUICK it reach it's potential. You're mileage average will be in the low 30s. It is really fun to drive- you feel safe and there is that smile that you have as you come inside. Go get one and have that pleasure that you richly deserve.",4
2272, on 12/29/17 14:00 PM (PST),Mel Mann ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Almost great," I found it interesting that the C-HR's I test drove early in the model introduction were under powered.  When it came time to buy 8 weeks later they were much better at acceleration.  The handling and breaking are great.  The body styling for the back seat door handles creates a large blind spot on the right side.  I do lengthy highway drives and use audio-books to keep me company; all 2018 Toyota's have discontinued having a CD drive in the entertainment system.  This may be great for a younger audience who lives their lives through a smart phone, but I miss the CD.  In so many ways the car exceeds my expectations, then in other ways I had not previously considered important...it is a frustration.",3
2273, on 12/19/17 18:59 PM (PST),Diane S ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Cute but lacking some things, No rear window washer . No rear latch within the car. Mileage is only 23 a Mile in town . Rear door is heavy.,3
2274, on 12/19/17 16:31 PM (PST),A.Kocka ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Sexy little SUV, This is the perfect vehicle for the woman in your life. At 5’2” it is easy for me to enter and exit the car. The front seats are very comfortable (being a person who has had back surgeries) that is very important for lengthy trips. I also like the fact that the rear camera is located within the rear view mirror as that is the natural place your eyes 👀 go to when backing up. The voice controls are awesome so you don’t have to figet around when driving. Nice night detailing. When you open the door Toyota CHR illuminates on the ground which gives it a classy feel. The ride is very comfortable and the safety features are amazing. I have only had my C-HR for a month and I really like it. It not too big or to small it’s just right.,5

2277, on 11/21/17 20:48 PM (PST),Fred From Utah ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Love My CH-R," Fun to drive. Great styling. Feel great sitting in the drivers seat. Wish it had satellite radio, Cd Player and had a backup camera not in the mirror. The only thing you must be careful of is when pulling into a space it is easy to scrape the front low bumper. Wish it had a front camera for parking. But overall I love my CH-R. When I drive down the street I see heads turning to look at it. And when I park it people come over to ask about the car. They call it very snazzy looking. I was going to get the Nissan Juke until I heard it takes premium gas. Glad I did not get it as I love my CH-R better. For some reason the glass is hard to keep streaks off of it after cleaning. That is my only complaint. Are they using inferior glass?",5
2278, on 11/20/17 08:10 AM (PST),SWH ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Not so big and not too small," Yes, I've read the knocks on the acceleration, I had a V6 Cadillac, but truthfully where can you drive that fast any more?  The speed is perfectly adequate and may be the only downside to the car. The blind spots are thoroughly taken care of by the Blind Spot Detection.  I think it may be the safest car I've ever owned.  I drive it on the turnpike every day and acceleration once you are up to speed isn't an issue - you only see it when you try to accelerate from a stop.  The ride is close to my old Cadillac - it probably would be spot on with beefier tires, but it wouldn't look so great.  Steering is terrific. I love the rear view camera in the rear view mirror, makes total sense and is one of the reasons I bought the car.  I have the blue with white top so it's hard to find a cuter car.  Surprisingly my 6' husband has no issue with getting in and out or sitting comfortably - up higher than sedans.  The bluetooth is awesome but did miss XM radio so had it installed and it really should have a button to open your garage door.  It would also be super cool if your apps would show up on the big touch screen then I could see Waze better.  I would like to see it have 4 wheel drive, but that's going to increase the price a lot. I bought the car in October and its June now - and I would still say that I absolutely love this car.  Haven't had a problem, it's absolutely perfect.",5

2281, on 10/07/17 14:21 PM (PDT),Sober Boss ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Super Sporty," I owned a Subaru Legacy and had thought to buy another when the time came to purchase. I was blown away the first time I saw this in a parking lot. I love that it looks like a 2 door. Felt like it would be above my price and was happy to find it affordable for a beautiful new car. I test drove it and then walked away for a week. Went and drove a Subaru Crosstrek, Nissan Rogue Sport and Mazda 3 then went back to the CHR. I smiled and laughed the whole time I was driving this car. So much more fun then the others. Handles great, speedy and sporty. I have had so many comments that it looks like a car from the future or a spaceship. I love that, couldn't stand the thought of a boring sedan. I took a risk and went for the red, I had the windows tinted and it looks hot! No worries about it being a new model since it is a Toyota. Dealership was wonderful and made the sale a pleasure. Hope to have it for a long time. The only down side is the small back windows do create more of a blindspot than I am used to and if I had children in the back seat I don't think they would be able to see out. But since I don't have kids it is not an issue for me.",5
2282, on 10/01/17 13:40 PM (PDT),Janet Cunningham ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Great value and safety features, I really like this car! I am a single very small woman and I just leave the back seats folded. I have read that they have limited vision for passengers. My dealer is wonderful and the first 25000 miles of service is included. I am very happy with the standard safety features.,5
2283, on 09/18/17 15:23 PM (PDT),George ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Great little car, Before I purchased read all the reviews (europe) included. Front legroom is great unless you're a basketball player as well as rear legroom. Used to own a 5.7L hemi V8 and while the power is obviously less in the sport mode it's still pretty peppy. If you want a good radio/nav system you'll have to go aftermarket like I did and put the rearview camera through that screen and not use the rear view mirror screen (sometimes too much reflection). Love the safety features and the styling. Good gas mileage and plenty of power entering the highway and passing. Want better gas mileage use the economy mode.,4
2284, on 09/04/17 08:57 AM (PDT),Anthony Sanseverino ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Zips Right Along," After reading a couple of other reviews that said acceleration (especially to Highway speeds) was poor, I was quite apprehensive about leasing/purchasing this vehicle. But, after a test drive that allowed me to accelerate quickly, and get on the freeway, I've come to the conclusion that those other reviewers must be use to V-6, or V-8 power. Or, they aren't use to the smoothness of the CVT. As someone who transitioned from a 4-cylinder 2005 Toyota RAV-4 to the 2018 C-HR, I believe that the acceleration is quite adequate. And, a couple of times, I've had my head pushed back against the head-restraint. While I'm not one who needs a Navigation system to show me where to go, the Bluetooth connection for my cell phone (though, I don't use it often) is a great thing to have. Now, I've only had the car for a little over a week, but so far, it's been AWESOME! And, if the on-board computer is to be believed, the MPG on each trip has ranged from very good to absolutely fantastic (ranges between 22.6 to 40.8). While the SmartKey system took a bit of getting use (I've been turning a key for over 40 years :) ), it's a great feature. My only complaints are: the base model should also be equipped with the BSM system, RCTA and Backup camera; considering the sportiness of the car, dual-exhaust would have been neat (luckily, I can buy (and have bought) bolt-on dual-exhaust tips; and a choice of interior colors (I love the exterior Metallic Silver Knockout, but the black interior gets hot during the summer months in Phoenix, AZ).",5
2285, on 08/30/17 06:28 AM (PDT),Mitchell ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),HR-V is far Superior," Test drove the C-HR and was completely underwhelmed - specifically with the power train, driving dynamics, and tech. Engine is completely uninspiring and the CVT technology seems like it is from 2010. I would not trust safely passing anyone in this car on a two lane road. Steering feel is numb and light, which I expected for a Toyota. Handling was OK, the car felt somewhat secure going around turns when trying to drive with some gusto (very difficult to do that due to the weak powertrain). No Carplay or Android auto is unacceptable for a 2018 model and onboard infotainment is nothing to write home about. Truly a shame because the exterior styling of the car is attractive! I test drove a Honda HR-V after this and found that it is a superior car in every category - I ended up purchasing it later that day! My opinion - don't buy this car until you test drive an HR-V.",2

2287, on 07/30/17 00:07 AM (PDT),Marc ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),"Interesting looking; lacks power, small interior"," We liked the exterior looks of this car, but lack of power and small interior made this is no-go for us.  The front passenger seating required that knees practically be touching the dashboard.  I floored it at a green light, and no one could tell - it just gently accelerated up to speed - I would hate to think about trying to pass someone on the freeway or going up a steep hill.  Blind spots due to large pillars to the left and right of rear window, but Toyota Safety Sense standard is nice, though this car has the pared-down version for smaller vehicles, not the full-featured version like the RAV4, Camry, etc.  We wound up purchasing a RAV4 instead - more power, more room, more features, etc.  But don't expect to use Toyota's telenav through your smartphone - it's worse than using a printed out map - my 2002 Lexus GPS ran circles around it.  Come on Toyota, admit your mistake, dump telenav, and go with Android Auto and Apple Car Play like everyone else has figured out, or do you want to lose hundreds of thousands of car sales?",2

We have owned Jeeps- everything from the new Cherokee, to Grand Cherokee (and still have a Wrangler) for the past 30+ years.  I wanted a small crossover, and decided to go outside the Jeep family only after I first laid eyes on the CHR.  I absolutely fell in love with the styling.  At first glance I truly thought I would not be able to afford it, but was pleasantly surprised by the price tag.   I have owned it for just over 2 weeks and really love the way it handles.  Being used to the lower gear ratio of the Wrangler, the CHR feels like a speed demon.  I would love to see this vehicle with a sun roof and navigation... I am hoping that they come out with these options.  This is an awesome vehicle and I hope to be driving it for years to come!",5

(loved the car- Ext warranty run out)  We decided not to go back to Ford as the Edge has design and structural flaws in the newer model. (first had experience through Sister-in-law - Ford could not fix) We looked at and test drove VW, Jeep, and did not like the looks of Mazda, Nissan, Chevy, and did not want the high-end models, BMW, Porsche, Jag.  I had seen the Ch-R in reviews - So I suggested Toyota - WHAT? We have never owned a Toyota, Drove the Rav 4 (edge like and size) drove the 86 (too small) Drove the CH-R. Wife loved it (5'-2"") sporty 2 door look with 4 doors, hatchback, good gas mileage, and I (6'-1"") rode in the back seat without too many problems, comfy even.

I wanted a the SUV feel & the small size of a car.  Didnt want to have to jump in or crawl out & the C-HR is just that, perfect, compact, right height of getting in & out of the vehicle.  Still have the feel of SUV by putting the seats down & carry what I need at any time. Love the way the seat just wrap around me & sit so comfortable.  Dash is at the perfect angle where the driver can see & do if needed, since the controls are on the steering wheel you just need to glance at it.

With the Kona you can only open it if you are standing in the back and lift it open, its annoying to me because I have to put stuff down to lift it open instead of pushing a button and having it lift automatically.",4
2303, on 08/02/18 17:32 PM (PDT),Becki Saldana ,2018 Hyundai Kona  SE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Kona Power!," My husband and I started looking at the new 2018 Hyundai Kona on line. We had owned a 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe for years and were very happy with the low cost of maintenance and dependability. So, when we decided to trade in the Santa Fe for a new vehicle it was a no brainer. But, we also wanted to check out other small SUVs to compare deals and the quality along with performance. OMG, we drove so many and visited so many dealerships! The Ford Eco Sport not only was tiny, it was very uncomfortable and felt so cheap. Especially for the price. Plastic every where. I felt as if I were driving a toy. Next, we drove the GMC Terrain. Again, felt cheap, uncomfortable and the price was staggering! Then the Chevy Equinox. I actually enjoyed the ride, it was comfy, but, not economical. With gas prices the way they are, you need economical! The Honda CR-V felt tiny. The Honda pricing was difficult to swallow. So, moving on. We kept thinking about the Hyundai Kona and decided to check it out. We feel in love immediately! We are not small people, and there are three of us including our 6’ 3” large teenage son. All three of us fit comfortably! I was shocked to say the least. From the outside the Kona looks small. But, it is definitely large on the inside! The Kona is an absolute blast to drive. Fast, OMG! I love the Sport driving mode. We pass other vehicles on the freeway with ease! The gas tank is only 12 gallons, but, the fuel economy is awesome! We get close to 400 miles per tank and that includes city stop & go driving! The instrumentation is very well thought out and easy for anyone sitting in either front seats to reach and operate. I love the big touch screen panel! The system picks up every one of our Bluetooth phones. Operating the entertainment, climate controls, phone, everything is easy! We chose the base model and got it for a steel! The dealership gave us everything we wanted and more. This Hyundai Kona takes corners like it is on rails! Steering is smooth and responsive. Breaking is perfect. I can’t say enough about the Kona! We are so very happy with it and would not trade it back! Thank you Hyundai for designing and small SUV that packs a serious punch!",5
2304, on 07/23/18 23:14 PM (PDT),Bruce Levin ,2018 Hyundai Kona  SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),First model year beware," That the 2.0 engine is adequate in normal mode and very sporty and quick in sport mode. I am also getting better mileage than listed. I drove the Mazda CX3 and the Honda HRV and the Kona was the car I chose .Fun styling, huge value and one of the best cars I have driven. Most cars on the road are monochromatic = Black, White or silver.I opted for the blue body and the Charcoal top. This color really pops and exemplifiesthe great lines of the vehicle.Driving on the highway in a spring winter storm the aerodynamics of the body cut through the 35 MPH WINDS and the 3 inches of snow. I highly recommendthe Kona, great 5 year, 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty! 100,000 on the drivetrain! So DON'T beware of this 1st year vehicle!! Grab one!",5

Good gas mileage, better acceleration than reported.  Handles great and fun to drive.  Big info screen is great and interactive.  Issues are these.    1. Headliner keeps dropping down and rattling. Brought to the dealership, they did not have an answer after a week of having the car.  Still no solution 2 weeks later.  2. Back hatch does not properly close unless slammed.  3. Apple car play is hit and miss on connecting to the same phone.  4. Sun visors flip up so hard they cause the sunglasses holder to pop open time and time again.  5. When windows are opened in back and front not the whole car shakes, big airflow issue.  6. Storage is tight, very limited with cargo space, should not be considered an SUV.  7. Radio volume is quite lower than expected, dealership did not install antenna when first purchased.  8. The base options on the Kona are much lower overall quality the the 2017 Tuscon we also own. Overall a good little car, sub compact class.  3rd Hyundai we have owned, just the fact that it is a new car design and class, seems to have quite a few bugs that must be remedied in order for this to be a successful new car launch.",2

I went for the Limited AWD after comparing to a few cars in the class and it had so many features you can’t get on other cars for the price. After about 2 months, I am so happy with my purchase! It has the feel of luxury but also sporty. The sport mode is so fun! I can’t wait to put it to the test this winter in the North East.",5

It has plenty of cargo space for what I need, the front seats are super comfy. The only problem I have is the visibility at night. The low beams are nice and bright but pointed too low. If you're any more than 2 seconds behind someone, too close for high beams, there is a big black void between you and the car you're following. I'm going to see if they can be adjusted a bit higher. I live in a mountainous area, the roads aren't level, the headlights are pointed directly at the road so it's hard to see what's standing on the road. Like moose and deer.",5

Really sharp looking and has all the bells and whistle's but the cost was less than a Honda.  I took it for a test drive and was impressed with pick up and control.

The safety features are fantastic, especially the glass pop up screen that tells me my speed, shows me cars approaching on either side of me, and shows me my next navigation turn.  It holds the road like a champ.  It does everything automatically -- turns my lights on and off, turns the brights on and off, and runs the windshield wipers at whatever speed the rain requires.  The electronics are a bit complicated, but very exciting once you've mastered them.  (Love that it  charges an i-phone 8 or higher by just lying it on the shelf under the dashboard.)  I'm a senior and feel that this car makes me a far safer driver.  It won't let me make a mistake.  It beeps at me for everything from wandering out my lane to leaving my keys in the car.  Navigation is not as good as Google maps, but I use it anyway as I like having my turns crop up on the glass panel.  Also, really crowded in backseat with  grandkids' babyseats.  Think this new model offers a huge value for the price.",5

The ride and comfort of the KONA is unusual in this sub-compact segment.   We werre really surprised when we went to see it two weeks after hearing about.   Purchased it at the second dealer we visited.  It was a same day deal.   It beat out a huge discount on Ford Escape, a larger vehicle.    Over the last year we had looked at Honda HR-V, Toyota CH-R, Mazda CX-3, Nissan Juke, Jeep Compass, Chevy Trax and Buick Encore.    For our purposes the 2.0 L base engine is fine.   I did notice the cargo and passenger rating is an additional 860 pounds.  Traded in a 2015 Honda Fit EX-L Navi.  The Kona has Android Auto which when used with a Android smartphone will handle the Navigation aide task just fine.   I appreciate the variaty of four trim levels and additional optional equipment being available for those that choose to upscale.   We are fine with a SEL.  I'm a 6 foot 3 420 pound senior citizen and the comfort, legroom and headroom UP FRONT is just fine.   The front shoulder room is fine.    The rear seats are restricted.   The front doors are easy to get in and out.   Defintely appreciate the standard warraanty..  traction control is fine.   safety aides are controllable and not a nuisance.  Greatly appreciated.",5

Steering wheel didn't telescope close enough and seat never felt right.  Passenger seat was too high, non adjustable, not very comfortable.  Didn't notice it on the test drive.   Crusie control hunted.  I've never have CC vary in speed and operate so un-smooth.  It fought with the transmission logic.  So it would either have too much power or not enough power.  Had to hurt fuel economy.  SPeed would vary by +/- 1 mph and RPM swings by 500RPM on FLAT GROUND and even on a constant downhill!   My Honda Civic with same drivetrain doesn't do this at all.  Cargo area and rear seat space ad HUGE.   Best in class and probably rival full size SUV's and full size luxury cars.  Really nice back seat.  Automatic Climate control  wasn't very accurate and we constantly had to make temperature adjustments.  Again, my Honda Civic works much better.   Engine was a great compromise with plenty of power and great economy.  Never felt underpowered.  But the transmission could use to hold gears a little more even if it gives up some acceleration.  Too responsive.  Overall, I'd prefer a good 7 speed DCT or 8 or 9 speed conventional automatic.   On my Honda Civic, the CVT is a better match.  GET THE HONDA OEM STEERING WHEEL.  Cost $600 to have it dealer installed.  Don't know why this isn't standard on EX-L and above in the USA.  It is in Canada.",3

My car came with M/S tires and they are noisy on rough surfaces - worn concrete blacktop that has been torn up by studded tires. I do think that a lot of it could be taken care of with a less aggressive tire tread. I am about 1/2 way through a 3 year lease and the car has only about 5500 miles on it so will not invest money in different tires until I make a decision to buy the car at the end of the lease.

The performance is surprisingly good for a 1.5 turbo. The front seat comfort is excellent Fuel economy exceeds advertised MPG and the interval between service is great.  The car is enjoyable to drive either around town or on the road. The only downside is the touch screen radio controls, it is necessary to take your eyes off the road to change radio stations, and the car lacks a CD player which makes my extensive CD collection obsolete. Also I have to re-connect my phone every time I start the car, but that is probably because I use an old flip-phone. The pros far out weigh the cons on this vehicle and I would purchase it again.",5

We bought the CRV as we live in Chicago and thought we would enjoy the AWD features and the historical reliability of Honda. However, a few months in... in the dead of winter... we started having significant heating problems and fuel smell in the cabin. We did not think much of it until we realized the the turbo engine has a problem with oil dilution which can cause a myriad of other problems. In total, in the few months we had the CRV, we had problems with heating, sluggish acceleration, fuel smells in the cabin, needing (full synthetic) oil changes every approx 2,500 miles, and shaking at high speeds, and all our of safety features disengaging during the worst of weather without reason. Despite requesting support from Honda, Honda is not recognizing any of our issues as valid despite repeated requests, case numbers, and more. With that said, we said -- enough is enough -- and in May 2018, we will have officially traded our CRV for something much more reliable. Don't let the Honda name fool you, this vehicle is one heck off of a headache. We are currently getting approx 22pmg. This car costs way too much money for these kind of troubles.",2

2342, on 05/07/18 12:32 PM (PDT),David ,2017 Honda CR-V  EX-L 4dr SUV (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),electronics have a mind of their own," A great car overall in all aspects - comfort, economy, handling, etc.  But, I find the electronic features often have a mind of their own.  I'm driving down the freeway with no other cars within a hundred yards of me and all of a sudden the orange ""brake"" warning light comes on.  It goes off within a second or two.  Also, driving along, the left turn blinker light in the left side mirror goes on and the warning beeper sounds.  I haven't touched the turn signal lever and there are no cars to my left - zip, nada.  Again, the light and sound go off in a couple of seconds.  The brake thing has happened twice in the ten months or so I've owned the vehicle and the turn signal thing happens about once a week.  In addition to these issues, twice I've had the ""low tire pressure"" light go on, the first time causing me to get off the freeway only to find the tires all look perfectly fine.  I put a spritz of air in them and re-set the warning light and all is well until the same thing a few months later.  I think there's either a malfunction or the sensor is too sensitive to a loss of 1 or 2 psi.  The most recent kerfuffle was finding all four windows down and the sunroof wide open upon going out to my car in the morning.  I've since learned that it's an issue with my key fob - holding down the unlock button too long - I guess something pushed against it while it was in my pocket.  Overall, I have to say it's a great car and I'm glad I bought it but the electronic features are a nuisance, especially the ""safety"" issues that put me into a near panic mode thinking I'm missing something when there's nothing there to miss.  I'm also disappointed there is no cd player.  Come on Honda, you can do better.",4

It does have a lot of bells and whistles which do take some time learn about all of them. The average mpg since owning it is 32.5. iWhile the engine is very economical it struggles in going to a strong headwind.in regard to mpg. In driving back from Florida with a steady speed on the interstate the gas usage gage on the dash would show 38 to 40 mpg. In going into a strong head wind the gage would show 20 to 22mpg. 3,5
2344, on 05/01/18 15:22 PM (PDT),Bill N ,2017 Honda CR-V  EX 4dr SUV (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),One year review," I've had my 2017 for a year and a day now, may have written an early review, but thought I'd weigh in after reading some recent reviews here.  I'm liking this car more every time I drive it.  My wife and I bought it because we wanted something that sits higher than the 2010 Civic it replaced.  My first turbo, so I may not know what lag is, but I don't notice any delay in acceleration.  I find it has plenty of pep, and I keep it in ECON mode almost all of the time.  I don't understand when people say it's slow.  With 6200 miles on the clock, on-board telemetry says 32 mpg.  That's 2/3 city, 1/3 highway miles, so I'm not complaining.  I like most of the safety features, the exception being LKAS.  It has to ""see"" the lane lines, so when there's a break for off/on ramps, or driving into the sun, it can't track.  And there are times on western freeways when I don't WANT to be in the center of the lane.  The adaptive cruise and low speed follow are great.  Blind spot monitoring and lane departure have already saved my bacon once or twice.  The collision mitigation has warned me to brake a couple of times.  My favorite feature is the brake hold, which makes city driving much easier.  I feel it is a very safe car.  Comfort is good, some might find the seat cushions a bit short, but this is the first car I've owned for many years that I didn't need a folded towel or pillow for lumbar support.  This is also my first infotainment system, had to dump both the CDs and the MP3, and got an i-pod.  Once I got familiar with the controls, I have no issues.  I wouldn't recommend trying to change balance or tone while driving, but those are pretty much set and forget unless there's a whiny passenger in the back seat.  The interface with my smart phone works well.  I've driven Hondas for 34 years and hope this one is as trouble free as the other three.  So far, so good!",5

No problems here. The Sports mode when you need to move is adequate compared to older CR V’s. This vehicle is so much more refined than previous generations and I am sure the higher end model owners can attest to that even more. This past winter was the winner for me,the vehicle handled better than expected on all season tires.",5

Black metallic with black interior. I was thinking about purchasing the 2016 CR-V, but then the dealer informed me that there will be a complete design change the following year. I was NOT disappointed. The new CR-V looks sporty, drives exceptionally well and definitely gives all of the 200 HP available. I happened to purchase the EX version and there was so many features included for the money. For instance, lane keeping assist, lane departure, blind spot warning with cross traffic, moon roof, and one of my favorite feature, wood trimming inside. I was very impressed with the drive when I test drove it originally. Currently, I use it everyday to commute to school, and it definitely picks up power on the freeway. If you use Sport Mode (S), then it will definitely boost up the acceleration. Gas mileage it says you average about 27 in the city and 33 on the highway. I almost ALWAYS average near 30 MPG on one tank of gas (and that is a combination of surface streets and freeways). Sticker price for the EX is about $29,000 but I was able to get it a little cheaper due to 2 trade-ins. Overall, you will not be disappointed, technically its my first car I've owned and Honda has always continued to impress me!",5
2348, on 04/08/18 17:03 PM (PDT),First time Honda owner ,2017 Honda CR-V  Touring 4dr SUV AWD (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Nice SUV with major engine problem," During the first 3000 miles I would have rated the CRV excellent in most categories. It is comfortable and roomy for both myself at over 6 feet tall, and my wife at 5 feet tall. The acceleration and gas mileage (25mpg around town) are both very good. I miss having a heated steering wheel and vented seats, which are not available on the CRV. However, at 3200 miles a serious engine problem showed up. At 70mph the car suddenly slowed, lost power, the check engine light came on, and multiple electrical systems reported malfunctions in the dash display. The car was towed to the Honda dealer and diagnosed with excess gas (approximately one quart) in the oil. The oil and filter was changed as a temporary solution, and a tech line case was opened with Honda. I was told at this time there is no permanent recall or fix. I was advised that this is a known problem in cold climates where the car is used for short drives and does not warm up completely. Since then I have learned that all CRVs with the 1.5 liter turbocharged engine have been recalled in China for the same problem. If you live in a cold climate I would not recommend this car at this time.",3

Dealer found the torque converter was not functioning correctly and replaced it. After researching this issue, I believe Honda has an issue with the Torque Converter / Transmission over heating to the point that the fluid is breaking down and causing other issue. (damage to: torque converter, needle bearing, solenoid) This has been in an issue in Honda models since 2005. I expressed concern to Honda of North America and I was stonewalled. I have concerns that the repair made by our dealer will not last. Torque Converters / Transmission issue should not be present for 200000 miles plus.",3

The noise continued throughout the weekend.  We made an appointment with dealership immediately.  Honda Corporate and the Service Manager determined through video chats and conference calls that the cams were destroyed in my engine.  They believe this had to do with fuel and oil mixing and getting into the engine.  Honda Corporate (800-999-1009) requested that dealership replace the Head of the Engine.  They have no fix for the problem with the fuel and oil mixing and destroying the engine.  The Service Manager said because the government is involved due to emissions, this issue will be continuing, and at this time there is no fix.  He also stated that Corporate informed him this was a Regional issue due to our climate, and they are currently trying to figure out a software fix for the problem.  No resolution at this point.  Corporate further stated that they are seeing this issue when the temperature is between 10 and 30 degrees.  I was offered a 100,000 extended warranty and recommended that I go to the dealer every 500 miles to get an oil change to see if fuel is mixing with the oil.  Shocked at the lack of resolution, I asked the Service Manager if Honda Corporate was comfortable giving me my car back after the cams were replaced with no resolution, and he said Yes.  I do not believe this is ethical at all for Honda to not have a fix to an engine problem that could endanger myself and/or my family.  I am not comfortable taking this car back knowing that the engine could be “scorched” again while driving to a destination.  It is neither safe nor prudent to drive a vehicle that has such engine problems considering it has less than 6000 miles.  This is a BRAND NEW Car!  On day 19 with no car and not final resolution in sight.  I am required to pick up my car when the head is replaced.  PLEASE DO NOT purchase the 2017/2017 CRV EX 1.5 turbo models.

Purchased the 2017 Touring CRV in August 2017.  First of all NO CD player--No pocket behind drivers seat-no comfortable arm rests for driver & passenger. Replaced it with a cheap piece of plastic that is annoying. It slides back and forth.  Use to have storage area on each side of the middle counsul. Did away with that.  I'm sorry I purchased that car. I was told ""It has everything"" Well needless to say after I got on the road I found it did not have everything.  I will choose another make of vehicle next time.

However, I have only had it for a couple of months. After a serious auto accident that totaled my previous sedan, I opted for the larger CRV with added safety features. The assisted cruise control is great, slowing up automatically when a slower vehicle is in front of you, preventing you from coming upon the slower care too quickly. However, the lane keeping assistance has room for improvement and at times can be dangerous. For one thing, it does not function well in the rain or when the windshield wipers are on. The more serious issue occurs in construction zones where there may be multiple lines painted on the road with new traffic patterns. On one occasion, there was a new traffic pattern in a construction zone with jersey walls on either side and the lane keeping assistance was confused by the painted lines and pulled me toward the jersey wall.",5

Chrome trim on tail gate, exhaust trim, and along bottom of doors ($1400 in parts) is noticeably corroding after the first 6 weeks of winter. Schomp Honda (CO) and Honda America both say the observed corrosion is caused by magnesium chloride applied to the roads and is not the result of defective material performance because it's due to ""outside and unforeseeable influences."" Aren't all parts of the vehicle subject to ""outside influences"" the moment you drive it off the lot? And if those parts begin to fail within a few months then there is something wrong. Dealer and Honda admitted that they've seen this corrosion on many other Honda vehicles. Honda knows that mag-chloride has been used since mid 1990s, so shouldn't they have designed parts that wouldn't corrode halfway through the first winter? In fact,  some chrome parts (front grille) are not corroding yet and appear to be designed or treated differently. After owning Honda cars for about 35 years I'm extremely dissatisfied with Schomp dealer and Honda and will never buy a Honda again.",3

I owned it for 6 months and absolutely loved driving it. The sensoring features on it kept me awake on my long commute to work. The off road departure, lane assist and cruise control pacing were/are a necessity for me now. I can't imagine driving without it. I was in a wreck where I rear-ended a vehicle sitting still on a dark, two-lane busy state route. I popped up over a hill and there was the car. There was not enough time to stop. My air bag deployed as I slammed into the back of the vehicle. The whole front end of the CRV was crushed and crumpled up to the windshield. I was perfectly fine - only one minor scratch on my hand. The amazing thing was I didn't even feel like I'd been in a crash. I didn't even get sore. The front end of the Honda totally absorbed the impact of the crash.

Our 2017 CR-V is 7 months old and has 5,000 miles on it and we have had multiple issues daily with the Apple CarPlay feature. Many times it will not show up on the display at all that a phone is connected even when plugged in. The dealership said it was because we had the phone connected to the vehicle via bluetooth and CarPlay and we were using a low end cable (we weren't) and we weren't plugging the phone in before the vehicle was started. I expected the next thing to be that we needed to hold our breath, keep one foot outside the vehicle when starting, and touch your tongue to your nose in order to make this feature work. We bought the top of the line CR-V - AWD, Touring, nearly every feature you could get, the only problem is that they don't work which is pretty disapointing from a brand like Honda and after spending $35K for the vehicle. We're being told that ""Apple updates the phones faster than we can update the vehicle software, but we know this is an issue"", however you aren't doing anything about it. In addition to the CarPlay issues we have had several other electrical issues with sensors, particularly the reverse/back up sensors (which have to be installed at the dealership and are not a factory option) not being loud enough to be heard with the radio at a reasonable volume (10-12). We have also had issues with the blind spot sensor on the driver's side indicating that there is a vehicle there when there is not a vehicle there. Does that mean that sometimes when there is a vehicle there it isn't working? We have also had issues adjusting the brightness of the driver display (all digital). Sometimes it will allow you to lower the brightness, sometimes turning the adjustment/trip knob does absolutely nothing. Lastly, when using navigation through CarPlay the volume does not go up high enough to be heard on the highway, and the volume of the radio does not lower to allow the turn by turn navigation instructions to be heard over the radio. While the vehicle does start every morning it is very concerning to have all of these electrical issues wtih a push button start vehicle. There are body pannel/trim fit issues on the vehicle that we didn't notice until we brough it home, its feeling more and more like we bought a lemon. We're currently considering trading the vehicle for something with functional technology or pursuing the Lemon Law here in Texas. It's been a real inconvenience to make multiple trips to the dealership for the same issues without resolution. Short story long...I'd buy something other than a Honda CR-V if I were in the market today.",2

However, the small 1.5L engine feels like it’s struggling at times to pull the weight of the vehicle.

The day I went to take delivery the salesman was doing his walk around with me and showing me how to operate the car. They were all ready to let me drive off the lot when I pointed out that the drivers seat bolster was malformed and deflated. The mechanic comes out and says they never saw anything like that. So I take the car home and make an appointment to drop it off so they can disassemble the seat to find out what is wrong. After 3 days they get the parts and put the seat back together. I go to pick it up. They seat is ok. Not perfect and the nice tan leather interior is covered in black greasy hand prints. So they bring another guy out to clean it. Which should have been done before I even got there. Fast forward 6 months and it is time for the 5000 mile check up and oil change. I tell them I have been hearing lifter noises and a strange whining from the transmission. After an hour in the waiting room they take me out to the garage to show me the underneath of new car covered in some kind of fluid that is leaking from somewhere under the motor. They don't know what kind of fluid it is. So I have to leave my car while they try to figure out what is wrong with it. A week later I get a call saying they think it is oil and it is the rear main seal. They tell me it was probably like that since my last change, at which time I point out that this is the first oil change on my new car so they say it was probably installed wrong at the factory and has been leaking like that since I got it new off the lot. They also tell me they don't know what they sounds are that I was hearing. So I guess I was hearing things! 3 weeks later they finally have the car back together and are going to drive it for 50 miles and make sure that there is no more leak. I opened up a case with Honda Motor Corp. because I have serious doubts about the reliability of this vehicle since it has been like this since the factory how do I know what kind of damage it has suffered internally? They mechanics say they didn't see any metal chips in the oil but I still don't trust them. I will be getting rid of this car. I don't trust. Honda Quality has gone right done the toilet.",1

No fix yet from Honda. If they can't figure it out in my opinion they shouldn't be selling the 1.5 turbo. The rest of my review remains the same. If the temperature is under 5 or 10 degrees f. the engine absolutely will not warm up. I can run it for five minutes and then make my 10 minute drive to work and the heat indicator barely starts to show. At negative temperatures it's miserable to drive because the interior never warms up. The dealer tells me they are all like this and say to leave your fan on low, crank the heat to high and don't use the auto-start. Not so easy to do when you live where it's sub zero for half the winter. Only other problem so far is my phone won't stay paired, that may be a phone issue. I actually like most things about the car but I gave a 3 star rating because the operating temperature problem is just not acceptable.

There are no changes from 2017 to 2018. This SUV is very roomy from front seats to the cargo area. Ride is very comfortable and CVT transmission seems to be smooth. I will not nit pic much as it is not a Cadillac. The road noise some refer to is not that noticeable even on the highway. Crappy tires can cause road noise in any car. Don't let those reviews turn you away from checking out this SUV. So far I am satisfied. Cannot speak for reliability as Its our first Honda. Honda's reputation speaks for itself so I hope to find myself in that family of happy long time owners some day. Acceleration is adequate for its size. Still breaking it in so I have not really opened it up. Again its not a Cadillac or Porsche. The radio/entertainment system is nice. EX Model does have Sirius XM despite most window stickers do not tell you that. Yes it is somewhat tricky to use at first but you have to sit in the car with the salesman and go over the features before you leave the lot. The fabric appears to be strong and seats firm. There are a lot of positions the driver seat will adjust to. It has tilt and telescopic steering wheel as well. Only time will tell how it holds up but first impression is an everlasting one.,5

The vehicle is ok for its class but in its class are a lot of other choices that are much better.  So do your homework before buying.  My major complaint is the heating system and that is why i am writing this review for it has a major flaw as most honda vehicles have.  The dealer says that this vehicle and the vehicle he drove to work this morning would not warm up on his way to work for the temps were in the low teens. Seems funny since my 2017 Escape that sat outside warmed up after a 1 1/2 mile drive and i was nice and toasty.  The temp gauge on the crv would not get off the cold mark after sitting in our garage and a five mile drive.  This was our second trip to the dealer for this problem and the second time they said it was normal.  After much dispute the dealer agreed to order a thermostat which is on national backorder and install it when it comes in.  Why is it on national back order?   Is Honda having some issues?  Oh and by the way the first time it was in the dealership the car was warmed up for 15 minutes and then it was a 10 mile drive to the dealer and we pulled in and the service person saw the low temp on the gauge.,3

This car got my attention and after having it a month, it has kept my attention.  It really is a great little car. There are no other cars in its class. I got a free life time warranty  on motor, drive train ectopic. I also purchased a lifetime extended warranty. What a deal and no other warranty like this. I guess this shows exactly how dependable this Honda CRV really is. I highly recommend  this car as it is far beyond the competition.  You want be sorry with this car.",5

Enjoy the heated seats but was driving over the holiday (outside temps in the teens) and it took a while for the interior of the car to warm up.  Love the fit and finish, the interior, the outside color and grey interior, etc.  The only real issue is that I have had a problem with the rear wiper - the bracket is broken and I've lost two wipers in the past month.  The dealership has been good to replace but I've called them about getting another replaced and hope they will not only replace but fix the bracket in which it fits so I don't lose another.",5
2379, on 01/02/18 15:50 PM (PST),Shaw ,2017 Honda CR-V  EX 4dr SUV AWD (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Never buy Honda CR-V," I bought a new Honda CR-V EX 2017 in February 2017 from the dealership, Castle Honda, in Morton Grove, IL. The car has problem getting started and, as a result, has become very unreliable and undependable. It has happened four times already and three times in less than last three weeks. First time the problem happened in August 2017 when I tried to start it after not driving it for a week when I was in vacation. I was able to jump start it with my other car. Second time the problem happened on 12/11/2017 and I was not able to jump start the car. I had to call the Honda roadside assistance on 12/12/2017 to tow the car but the tow truck guy was able to jump start the car. I drove the car to Castle Honda, the service department did some testing of the battery and said the battery was fine and they did not know the reason for the problem. I told them about the tailgate door not working properly as well, they tested that also and informed me that the struts were broken and and they ordered those parts. I drove back the car home hoping that the problem was fixed. I drove the car to Castle Honda again on 12/14/2017 to install the tailgate door struts. I am yet to find out what else is wrong with this car.Third time the problem happened on 12/29/2017 and I was not able to jump start the car. I called the Honda roadside assistance and this time they sent a guy to jump start the car. I drove the car to Castle Honda, the service department tested the battery again and said the battery was fine and they did not know the reason for the problem. They told me to tow the car next time the problem reoccured. I again drove the car home hoping that the problem was fixed. Fourth time the problem happened was on 12/31/2017. I had to wait and seek roadside assistance on 1/2/2018 as the dealership was closed on 12/31/2017 and 1/1/2018. I called the Honda roadside assistance around 6.30 AM and requested specifically for the car to be towed, they said the expected time was between 3 and 8 hours. The tow truck showed up to pick up the car around 11 AM. The tow truck guy from J-TEAM AUTOMOTIVE declined to tow the car and started showing lots of silly excuses of why he could not do it. I did not want to let him go and wait another 5 hours before any help arrived and so I let him jump start the car. I drove the car to Castle Honda and turned it off while waiting in the queue in front of me, the car could not be started after that. The dealership service department tested the battery and this time found the battery to have issues and replaced it. I do not know if this will resolve the issues with the car and the car continues to be as unreliable and undependable as it were.It appears to me that the dealership sold me a faulty car which has caused me lots of inconvenience and has costed me quite a bit in terms of hassle, time spent on the issues and missed work. I have been in contact with American Honda since 12/11/2017 and they have opened up a case on my car. The case manager keeps telling me that they bear no responsibility for the dealership or the roadside assistance and also only thing American Honda can do is to fix any issue the car may have since that’s what warranty is for. He does not appear to understand that having too many issues like I experience make Honda CR-V a inferior quality product, American Honda a low-grade manufacturer and Castle Honda a low-grade dealer. I have extremely negative customer experience with Honda CR-V, American Honda and Castle Honda. I will never buy any Honda product and tell others not to buy Honda products as well.",1

On a scale of 1-10 I would  rate it as a 4. The shift mechanism is a bit cheap as has way too much plastic and is a bit wobbly. Not nice and smooth operating.

This is the first Honda I purchased thinking I would trade it in in a few years on something else.  There is much to like about the CRV, but the driver's seat is not comfortable compared to my Odyssey and other vehicles I tested and it is not as attractive as other 2017 makes and models.  I also do not care for the sound system in the CRV.  It sounds cheap.  I decided on the CRV based on resale value.",4
2383, on 12/28/17 07:11 AM (PST),Peter ,2017 Honda CR-V  EX 4dr SUV AWD (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Coldest car I have ever owned," I live in Chicago, IL. We just started experiencing cold weather. I leave the car parked in my garage overnight, every morning I remote start it and then remote start it again 10 min later. I get in the car, the temperature gauge shows that the engine didn't heat up at all, not even 1 bar after approximately 15 min of running. The problem with this is that the car also doesn't blow hot air until the engine is heated up. I literally drove the car for 10 miles when the outside temperature was -2 F and it still didn't heat up the vehicle. I have heated seats and they do help but not enough, I hate the fact that I bought a AWD car for the winter and my main problems with it are happening during the winter. Absolutely the slowest heating car I have ever owned and if I had known that I would have never bought it. Other problems that I have experienced are with the car's entertainment system, it needs a software update. Very slow and laggy. fuel consumption is bad for me, I only get 23.2 mpg. I wish I could return the car now and get something else. Unfortunately I will be stuck with it for at least another 2.5 years until my lease is up.",3

Well let me tell you, throw those ratings right out the window. I traded in a Ram1500 and a Jeep Compass for TWO Honda CR-V's. One is an LX, other is an EX, both AWD. The EX has already experienced a dead battery - left me stranded after only 6 weeks of ownership, something that has never happened to me before in all my years of driving, and I am 64 years old. The dealer replaced the battery, but I still feel like something else might be wrong - - the electronic dashboard keeps doing goofy things. Also, this vehicle is plagued my countless rattles. The other one - the LX, is also plagued by countless rattles, and is at times, hard to start. The only good things I can say at this time, is the vehicles are roomy, and do get good MPG's. I personally prefer the 2.4 engine in the LX, over the 1.5 turbo in the EX. For Honda's so called great reputation, I am highly DISSAPPOINTED, in these 2 CR-V's. I wish I would have stuck with Chrysler products. My recommendation is do not buy Honda.",2

There was a moldy musty smell in the cabin of the car every time it rained. After months passenger floor was completely soaked through from below. The car continued to develop mold and water, but the dealership denied there was water at all. After 5 months of being told the car was fine, the mold became unbearable and I became sick from driving in it daily. It was finally taken in and the dealership tried to find the cause of the water coming in that was flooding out below the passenger seat and footwell. After 1 month of trying to find the solution they gave up, eradicated the mold and put it back together. After being told by Toyota to go get a lawyer, I did just that and filed a lemon law complaint. The company is now buying  back the car but the process has been horrific.

Test drive this car at night before you buy.  This car is extremely dangerous if you live or drive on unlit narrow, curvy, hilly rural roads at night.   In designing this car's headlights, Toyota has put form over function.  It has packed the RAV4 with all kinds of safety features, including numerous airbags.  You will need them, since you cannot safely see to drive at night.   The IIHS rates the headlights as ""marginal,"" and states that on curves the high beams are inadequate in all 4 tests conducted.  At night with the headlights on, the lack of illumination is dangerous.  The top half of the windshield appears dark as if it has black frost on it.  You can see through only the lower half of the windshield, which has limited visibility through which you can see straight ahead, but have little peripheral visibility. Going down hills cuts the visibility considerably, at times to as little as 50 feet.  Sharp turns to the left or right are blind.  Toyota refuses to fix the problem, since the headlights are ""working as designed.""  Great--a design defect.  Wish we had known.  We have had 3 Toyotas previously, which we loved.

I would Trade up across the Toyota/Lexus Range, and its bye bye German Cars, storage space is significantly better but I was trading up from a series of Station Wagons, In Car Tech could do with a refresh.

2417, on 10/29/17 07:45 AM (PDT),Pogino1 ,2017 Toyota RAV4  XLE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Very very Disappointing car from Toyota!!!! Rav4," Rough, hard, unconfortable ride, hard and stiff suspension. Slow pickup, too high center of gravity. Poorest features. Cloth instead of rubber mat and cargo mat. No door edge protection. Poor cloth trim. Nice alloy wheels. Cheap small cargo lights.Very far features from Toyota Camry LE 2011 and Camry LE 2014.I am very disappointed with Toyota. I bought Toyota Camry 2011 brand new - excellent car, great ride and very reliable. I bought  another Toyota Camry 2014 brand new- semi excellent car. Reliable but 2011 Camry was better. I am a Toyota loyalist!!!So bought another Toyota this time a 2017 RAV4.  This car is so bad and way far below from 2 Toyota Camry's that I have bought from 2011.  This is the ugliest and worst features a Toyota car that I have.  From a new owners point of view, I wish I did not buy this and I will not buy another Toyota anymore. Not recommend Toyota to my friends.Last service experience 2017 at Toyota Auto nation for my 2014 Toyota.  Just came in to replace one tire that had a punctureAt the left front tire and an oil and filter change. Seems simple for one hour job!All my four tires were still good and still had a lot of traction and treads on all my four tires. Instead I was being sold by Oscar to buy four new Michelin tires for about $755 installed.  I felt there was something fishy and untrue to what he was saying about my tires. He was very insistent to sell the new tires. Something dishonest so I declined.Instead of a mere 1 hour for an oil and filter change it took almost 3 hours and I wondered what they were doing? Oscar told me they were fixing it.  Guess what, after I declined to buy tires from Oscar, after waiting 3 hours, when I returned homeI found the left front tire that had a puncture was now in the left rear and I found the 3 other new tires that I hadHas been replaced by Toyota with 3 old tires with very minimum tire treads. What a service. What a disappointment. What a dishonesty. What a bunch of thieves. I lost sleep over it and I am sure they will deny it so what's the point of dealing with dishonest service shop.  So I went to another shop to buy all four new tires aligned and installed for only $640. I was very happy with this shop. I was very angry with Toyota and will never buy from them again.",1

2428, on 09/10/17 20:54 PM (PDT),Steven ,2017 Toyota RAV4  Limited 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Review From Car Dummies," Toyota's Pre Collision System is not reliable.  The emergency brake system will beep you, however, the PCS will not reduce or stop for you.  At night, it gets worse, the radar will not detect vehicle in front of you most of the time.  If a vehicle in front of you is moving forward even an one mph, and you are approaching at low or high speed, the Toyota PCS will not even warn you.  The PCS beeps under several conditions only:  the vehicle in front of you is complete stop position, and it has to be daytime, if you are approaching at about 20 mph, the pcs will sometimes beeps you about within 20 - 25 feet away from the vehicle in front of you, which in real world, the distance and the reaction time to take action may be too short for the average people to react and it won't avoid collision. The rear vent A/C panel is located on front dashboard, very inefficient, most of other automakers rear vent a/c is located by rear side of center console compartment.  The master window switch compartment has only one button is illuminated; the driver side, all other has no lights, makes hard to find switches at night time.  The flooring material is made of cheap fabric, feels like made of thin cardboard like material, easy to ripped off and not durable.  The led headlight is not brighter than regular halogen bulb.  I do not see any advantage of led brightness.  The interior such as dashboard and overall design is made of hard plastic and overall interior quality is below average, compare to Nissan Rogue, Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester, Mazda CX-5, Hyundai Tucson and etc.... The acceleration, steering handling, ride comfort, cabin noise levels are good and acceptable. The Navigation system map is bit confusing in terms of display, this maybe cause I've been using Garmin System for many years.",2

Entune audio plus with JBL speakers, has a problem which Toyota will not acknowledge. You cannot hear any sound from the rear speakers. I took the car in to have it checked only to be told it was working . The service manager listened to it and agreed . He searched Toyotas website for any info and  came up blank. He looked for another car in inventory with the same radio number to compare it to and it was the same. He said he would search further and get back to me. I searched the net only to find out this has been a problem since 2014 that Toyota won't acknowledge. Also the LDA(Lane Departure Alert) warning can't be heard.

2432, on 08/11/17 19:49 PM (PDT),cyclocrossboy ,2017 Toyota RAV4  LE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Not a vehicle for me," Okay I drive a Subaru WRX, my wife a Crosstrek, my son a Outback and in the base a Legacy.  So from that POV on a recent trip I rented a Toyota RAV4 for an two week hiking trip in the Northwest to Mt Hood, Mt Rainer and Mt Olympia; I would be traveling on a number of dirt back roads and wanted an SUV.  Lets start with the positive.  The vehicle was new... it had less the 5 k miles and still had the new car smell.  The storage was more than adequate for our back country gear.  The AC was good and the controls were generally intuitive except for the A/B Odometer control.  Now for what I did not like.  Even though this is an AWD vehicle it drives like a FWD vehicle; the torque steer is quite noticeable on acceleration.  The handling is very vague not crips like I'm use to with the Subaru's I've driven; cornering at speed can be disconcerting.  Braking is fine.  Many speak of the advantage of the height of an SUV but I found the nose of the RAV4 hiding what was directly in front of me.  Now the rear view camera was a disappointment; the guidelines superimposed on the image were off and placed my too close to surrounding vehicles.  As for the transmission, I found myself having to manually set the gear on back roads because it was constantly switching between gears or lacked need power to get up the steep inclines.  So in a nut shell I really wish I had rented a Subaru Outback because the handling, and power delivery are superior.",3

Honda CRV and Subaru Forest interiors are way to dated.  Kia Sportage seem to have a cheap interior and was pricey with all the bells and whistles.   CRV is way too much road noise.  Not sure why so of the reviews say RAV4 lacks power it’s an SUV to me it has enough power you not going out and racing it.  Don’t base your purchase on a company’s review but base it on the consumers review and go out and test drive for yourself.  I am getting 30 miles to the gallon on the highway with ac running full blast and temps outside at 100 plus.  Around town I’m getting 25-27.  Yes, the RAV4 doesn’t have any rear air vent but believe me when I say it doesn’t need them.  It has one in the center dash that blows straight to the rear and this AC is the coldest Ac I have ever had in a car and I have owned Chevy, Old’s, Fords, Subaru, Hondas and Kia’s.

The new XLE version is so much quieter than our older 2011 RAV4 and has a much improved ride.  The Entune sound system is likewise deserving of high marks, and even though it doesn't have Apple Car Play, it works seamlessly with both Bluetooth and the lightning/USB connection for music, calls, etc.  Very impressive.   On the mechanical side, the RAV has real good pickup and has kept us in the 30-31 mpg range on our two highway trips thus far.  For an AWD vehicle that's not too shabby!   Overall we are extremely pleased with our purchase. Given Toyota's legendary reliability, we expect to enjoy the RAV4 for quite some time.

The 2017 RAV4's only offer a 4 cylinder engine, the 2016's offered a 6 cylinder.  The SE comes with the ECO/Sport modes.  ECO I'm getting about 29mpg, Sport mode close to the same, although engine is more peppy in sport mode.  There is plenty of power for merging onto highways and for passing in my opinion.  Interior is quiet and road/engine noise into the cabin is minimal.  The SE's suspension is more stiff, a little more rough than I'd like but ok.  Almost no vehicle lean going around corners, electric steering feels fine also.  Stereo is great!  Cabin speakers more than adequate, better than my Escape's.  The seats are not as comfortable as I would have expected, a bit disappointing!  The headlights and tail lights have the LED trim which looks very nice.  Great visibility at night with just low beams on!  Back seat is spacious, cargo area fine.  The only thing I wish I had is memory button for drivers seat and a power passenger seat.  Other than that it's a nice vehicle, but I only have a little over 550 miles on it so far.I've had my Rav4 now for 13 months....accumulating 32K miles on it so far.  Here is what I think now about it.  The front cup holders are in terrible locations, I've spilled drinks due to this, very irritating!  The seats , front and back, could use more padding, not comfortable on long drives.  Big problems are night driving, not all buttons are lit!  You better know where they are in the dark!  The dash lights only go so bright, not enough for me...and it appears not for others reviewing this vehicle either.  The steering wheel needs to tilt more and telescope further out. Those are the negatives!  The gas mileage is great for an AWD, I average 27 in the Winter and 29 in the Summer.  Legroom/headroom is very good, I'm 6'-4"" and 260 lbs. and I have no issues.  Cargo space is good also.  It handles very driving in the snow also.  The safety features saved me several times from accidents, and I consider myself an attentive driver.  The LED taillights and bright white headlamps look great, fantastic visibility when driving at night",4
2456, on 03/12/17 08:19 AM (PDT),Goose ,2017 Toyota RAV4  XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),"ITS A BUDGET SUV, DRIVE THE COMPETION FIRST"," I had my vehicle, 2004 4Runner,  in the dealer shop and had to rent a car. The Toyo dealer rented cars and I decide on the RAV4 AWD LE.  First thing I did was reduce the tire pressure to the vehicles door jam specification.  Here is my take.  Its not as quiet as my 2004 4Runner, especially on rough roads.  On the Freeway it is quiet, so long as the road surface is good.  Seats are comfy but the hip bolstering can make it difficult to get out of the vehicle.  Stereo sounded pretty good at a stop or stop light, but the sound quality goes down hill as the speed increases.  Its nimble and the short wheel base takes all of the credit.  The MPG was around 24 with lots of city driving, I'm not a lead foot or a grandpa driver.  So would I consider this for purchase?  No, the deal breaker is the amount of noise that makes into the car.  I'd like to add that on the previous day I had a 2017 Ford Fusion hybrid and that thing was luxury quiet, on any road surface.  I use to have a 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport and that thing was quieter and more fun to drive than the RAV4.  So there is my take, good luck with your decision.",3

Live in a Northern state so we need All Wheel Drive and Leather seats with seat heaters. The drivability of the car is great due to it's 6 speed transmission. It is not a race car but drives reasonably well.  It's driven by myself and my wife. If driven gently mpg are in the 30s. Very pleased overall. One odd thing we found is the rear seat  warning lights were on some days and off on others upon start up. It turns out the lights are triggered by the opening of the back doors so if the doors are opened between having been driven the warning lights come on upon start-up. If the doors had not been opened the lights do not come on. I had to call Toyota, the dealer had no idea how they worked.",5

I love this SUV but I'm sorry that I didn't get the Hybrid because the gas mileage is NOT good (very disappointed). The ride and comfort is excellent and the visability is great.

The visibility is pretty lousy. There are a lot of techno gizmos in the car that are mostly superfluous. I'd love my old radio back from my 2002 Jeep Liberty over the overly teched up, but difficult to use system in this car. Oh, sometimes the electronic ignition just doesn't work. That's why I'm writing this review right now, because my key suddenly does not function and the car is 11 months old and has just 8500 miles on it. Typical for this car. Too many modern appliances and not enough thought in making it work well. One good thing ... my wife hates driving it so much that she won't take it out.

2467, on 07/20/18 19:27 PM (PDT),Driving is fun ,2017 Mazda CX-5  Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Zoom Zoom in an SUV?," We purchased our CX-5 Touring with preferred equipment package (moonroof, Bose, navigation, power lift gate, etc.) new in December 2017. The main competitors that we shopped were RAV4 and Ford Escape. We ruled out the Escape pretty quickly because my wife did not like exterior design. They can get pricey with the bigger engine and nicer interior features. The RAV4 seemed dated in the interior compared to Mazda CX-5. The Mazda also felt more energetic (better acceleration) and less noisy. The Toyota definitely had more back seat room, but we sacrificed the space for nicer interior materials with a more modern look. Also, I found the Toyota front seat lower cushions to be uncomfortable during our test drives. We now have just over 15,000 miles on our Mazda, and we continue to enjoy it. I like the manual shift option or the sport button for a little more oomph when accelerating. My wife enjoys the smooth ride, the exterior styling, and the AWD. The AWD was noticeably better than our previous FWD vehicle at managing one of our snowy, uphill turns this past winter. We have had no problems with the vehicle so far. We have been averaging 26.7 mpg in about 70/30 mix of highway/city driving, which has been better than I expected. The navigation can occasionally be finicky and a little slow with directions, but it generally works well. The Bose stereo seems very good to me, and I like the power lift gate better than I expected. The blind spot monitoring, with warning lights on the side mirrors is a useful safety feature. Mazda did a nice job integrating numerous features into this vehicle without sacrificing fun(?) driving dynamics in an SUV.",5

Love the change in hatchback door lifting &  closing automatically; after all, this change was due when other SUVs had it already....BUT.....this hatch door does NOT lift up high enough.  Must bend & be cautious of hitting my head when loading this area, just too annoying overall. Other SUVs raise higher.  I'm only 5'3""! This is a safety issue as far as I'm concerned.  Raising the height by replacing ""lift bars"" should be considered a recall for safety reasons alone.",4
2469, on 06/07/18 11:49 AM (PDT),Chase ,2017 Mazda CX-5  Touring 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Touring edition has strange options left out," Overall, I like the car, well enough that we leased another of the same model/trim for my wife. The car is fun to drive, relatively good MPG and quiet. A few issues: I paid extra for the Machine Gray color, which looks really nice, but has been extremely prone to scratches and acid etching from bird droppings. I had a large seagull dropping that I removed within an hour of noticing. There was an acid-etched ring from the dropping's perimeter which I tried to take out with Meguire's Ultimate Compound, which is extremely gentle from my experience on several past vehicles. I used a microfiber cloth with very light pressure and I was left with what looked like a black burn mark from a rotary buffer. I had to get the area repainted. Any sort of contact from anything (jeans, kid's backpack etc.) seems to leave a mark. The paint seems ridiculously soft and I'm pretty annoyed I paid a premium for the ""upgrade"".  No light in the glove box, no center vents' flow control are strange things to be missing at this mid-trim level. The headlights automatically go on in dark areas which lull the driver into thinking all the lights are on. What you find out once you're pulled over, is that the taillights aren't on. I'm sure it would have been just as easy for Mazda engineers to have all the lights go on once the light sensor has been activated, but they want you to upgrade to the Grand Touring. I wanted the Touring, since I preferred how the wheels matched the Machine Gray color. Another aggravation is if you mistakenly push the engine off button if you're not in park, you have to cycle through turning the engine back on/off to have everything turn off. If you have a lot of contacts (I have almost 1100), they won't all fit into the memory, mine stop at ""M"" and it takes at least 45 seconds for the (limited) contacts to load, which slows down everything (listening to music, making calls) until the infotain system loads. I was worried about the faux leather/cloth combo seats holding up/repelling stains since I go to the gym fairly frequently and am often sweaty getting in the car. The seats still looks like new over a year later and they're pretty comfortable.",4

It is a very showy car and I have had quite a few compliments from strangers.  I wanted a Volvo XC-60 but I couldn't bring myself to part with the coin.  The Mazda gave me 95% of the satisfaction for 50% of the cost.  With rebates and dealer discounts, I purchased a fairly loaded vehicle, tax included, for just over $30K!   Many of the concerns of other reviewers were non-starters for me.   Driver legroom - I'm 5-8.   Cargo capacity - I have an F-150 when I need to haul stuff.   Engine power - I'm more focused on mileage. That said, the CX5 has plenty of power.  I've played with the Sport mode a couple of times which raises the shift points, but I think standard driving mode is just fine.  I took the car to Lake Tahoe from SF Bay Area and got 31.5 mpg! (That's over a 7,000 foot elevation climb.) The interior in this car rivals many luxury cars. Very comfortable for long drives and the materials are top notch.  I love the console controls - I can operate the radio without looking at them. My only complaint to date is a buzz in the dash speaker that, hopefully, can be rectified when I get the vehicle serviced. Other than that, it is a quiet, fun-to-drive, luxurious car!",5

All of the issues I had with the 2015 have been resolved with the new model. Less noise, a better sound system, updated dashboard and addition of rear cross traffic alert. The upgrade to the GT is well worth the money with the quality leather interior, moon roof, voice activated phone and navigation, adaptive cruise control, lane keep/assist etc. If one is looking for a soft ride, this isn't the right choice as the low profile tires and sporty suspension give a lot of road feel.

I had gone to the dealer to look at a low mileage 2015 Cadillac SRX - love that vehicle but this one only had front wheel drive and living in Colorado, I wanted all wheel drive.  The Cadillac had some very nice features and a V-6 with lots of luxury and tech toys.  I only owned one new car in my life and that was in 1973.  I never thought I would purchase another new car in my life.  Until after that test drive in the CX-5 that had caught my eye (yes, the salesman noticed)...  The CX-5 was just as luxurious and had MORE tech toys than the SRX, my only concern was the 4 cylinder engine (my trade in was a V8).  I was quite impressed with the zoom-zoom and only tried out the ""sport"" mode on the transmission for a few seconds that made me believe I would be satisfied with the performance.  That along with the wonderful handling while driving, turning, cornering and stopping convinced me to purchase.   Then when new 2017 Mazda ended up being affordable after some negotiating - trade-in - and a great 0% financing deal I drove it home.  I have only had it for 12 days, but each day I like it more.  Maybe by the end of the month I will have learned to use all the technology (and I am a computer programmer by profession).

We love how it drives, feeling sporty and engaging whilst also holding the road well and hugging corners superbly. Acceleration is often cumbersome, and a few times I have noticed gear shifts seem nonsensical. Ride comfort overall is great, especially for the driver, with minimal cabin noise. Rear seats could have more leg room for sure, four six foot plus adults will struggle. Quality of interior materials is especially eye catching, giving the cabin a real upper class feel. Cargo storage definitely lags behind rivals, but rarely has it been a problem for us so far. We have the navigation system as part of a package including the power liftgate (which is great), however it is very unreliable and not recommended. The infotainment system is simple to navigate and logical, although no Apple CarPlay is a huge disappointment. Another big let down is lack of SiriusXM on the Touring trim, but we weren’t prepared to upgrade to the Grand Touring to get it. Overall we are very pleased with the vehicle. I am just hopeful that the next time we are looking to lease that Mazda have ironed out the imperfections stopping this being the perfect compact SUV. As it stands, it’s not far off at all.",4

Ride is just about right though it does not handle as well as with other SUVs I have driven at the higher speeds. Engine is very quite at idle where it feels it is not on. The only complaint I had is when I first bought it, the CX-5 was smoking quite a bit. I thought I had an engine oil leak, however after driving more that 600 miles the issue went away and no longer smoking. I check for leaks and NO oil leaks. The same issue happened driving the test car.  This issue lasted a little longer than usual for a new car. The smoking is gone, looks like the engine has worked itself in, and I am very happy with it now. I am use to the center console buttons where they are now intuitive. I average about 26mpg at this time.",5

Its nice to be able to get into and step out Rather than get down into or fall into and climb up and out of a vehicle. You don't need a cast of thousands to extract the old folks at the event!  Shopping bags come out at waist level even from the seats. Bending is eliminated. CX 5 looks good makes old folks look cool. The body contouring has people asking what is it? Young or elderly this car fits everyone.,5

I had made up my mind after test driving, bells and whistles, etc etc that I was set on a Honda CRV Touring......but because I had a trade in and the Honda is the best selling small SUV..... there were no incentives.I also wanted a particular exterior and interior colors......which I couldn't have in the Honda, I decided on my second best choice, the Mazda CX 5.  I am not disappointed.  As with any new vehicle that has so much tech in it....it takes time to learn...... and I'm still learning.....End game (I had a 2015 Volvo XC 60) the Mazda rides better, handles better, gets better mpg, has better tech.......you get the idea.  I am believing that I will have this SUV for many happy years to come.  If you haven't considered a Mazda, you should.  It's a beautiful vehicle that is fun to drive!",5
2497, on 11/29/17 06:53 AM (PST),Jeff Behm ,2017 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),An SUV with the soul of a Miata," This is my second Mazda CX-5. I had a 2013 previously and loved it. But the new style, upscale features and comfort won me over, and I had to get the 2017. I am very glad I did. I was debating between this and a Honda CRV, which is also an excellent vehicle, but a very poor sales experience at my local Honda dealer in Princeton convinced me to go for the Mazda. If  you need a ton of room and a large family vehicle, the Honda may be a better choice. But, the Mazda drives better, handles better, and (this surprises me) I think Mazda engineering & design has eclipsed the legendary Honda engineers. Every little detail on the Mazda has been so thoroughly engineered and designed that you just feel like the Mazda is punching above its weight class. The interior design & materials are MUCH nicer than any other small SUV, and compares more directly to the Audi Q3 or BMW X3 than to the CRV or Escape. The engine and transmission are so well integrated & responsive that the CX5 feels faster and more powerful than it is. The CX-5 is very quiet on the road, and I am getting about 27 to 28 mpg avg (I drive very little in the city). The Bose sound system is a HUGE upgrade from the system in the 2013, and the safety aids, incl the lane keeping, blind-spot monitoring, and heads up display are GREAT! They are so well integrated into the vehicle's operation, that you quickly just forget they are there and start to rely upon them and how well they work. I have the Soul Red Crystal paint, and all I can say it, the depth and luster of the red color is amazing. To get paint this good in another brand, you need to shop at Porsche. It even shines when dirty! Gripes? Well, the the traction control system is a bit too aggressive for my tastes and kicks in a little too early in fast turns (though the CX5 still out-handles everything in its class). That's about it. When you drive this car, you get the feeling that EVERYONE at Mazda put in lots of overtime to make this car feel like it's worth more than it cost. If your dream SUV is a Porsche Cayenne S, but your budget is less than half of that vehicle's sticker, this is your best choice.",5

I drove from Kentucky to Pennsylvania and never got tired driving it.  The electronic system made it easy to switch from phone to GPS to music.  The sound system is awesomely clear.  Pick up when entering the interstate is fantastic and smooth.  So many alerts on this car that it took me a while to feel comfortable learning how to use them.   My family and friends love this car also.  They have plenty of room and are impressed with its overall quietness.  I did a lot of research for months before buying.  I was tired of the same look and colors of SUVs.  A mechanic told me to look at  the Mazda brand. I have not had the SUV long enough to have mechanical problems.  The color is beautiful and I receive a lot of compliments on its looks and functionality.  I would definitely recommend it and buy it all over again.,5

In looking for a new car we tested Audi, Acura and Mercedes and found the value proposition more enticing in the Mazda.  The interior and exterior are pleasing with comfort and roominess.  We took the car on a long trip and loved the comfort, ride and handling.  The safety features in the new tech are solid with the ability to allow the car to drive itself - only steering.  Biggest beef I would have is the updated Sirius which no longer has your favorite pre-selected picks bundled.  While the new model has favorites you have more work to get through the list and cannot do what we did - pre select our top picks so either of us could easily transfer between music selections.  The navigation takes some patience but appears better than Tom Tom.  Pet peeve is that you are locked out of NAV when car is moving rather than having an option to allow the passenger to key in directions.   And the programming took a little getting used to but the search feature is a plus.",4

My biggest disappointments in this vehicle are the technology and fuel economy. The InfoTainment center is lacking. Navigation has no up to date traffic. The Bluetooth is kinda clunky. The climate control is a little frustrating. And the fuel economy is no where near the EPA estimate. It reminds me of the economy I got on a 2001 Ford Taurus.

Mazda would benefit greatly by partnering with Tom Tom. It is a shame to have this system on a car that is,otherwise, a very up to date vehicle. I would have expected a system like this four or five generations ago. Also, the sound system is not really great, for a ten speaker Bose system.  Nav screen is bright at night and dim during day instead of bright in daylight and dim at night.It is distracting and a pain to keep resetting it  On auto it should not require adjusting.",5

I wanted to give it time to see how I felt and I am very pleased.  I went into Groove Mazda on Labor Day looking for a new ride after 13 years of driving my great car.  It was time to say goodbye and hello to Mazda.  Right when I walked in, I was greeted by David who soon introduced me to Jason.  He was super helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable as he told me all about the models.  I asked a lot of questions and he went out of his way to answer them all.  The CX5 Touring rode very smoothly and had a very so many new bells and whistles.  The size, the monitor, the legroom, AWD option, and the cost impressed me.  When I finally made my decision on a different color from white to gray, Jason found me my car.  It took a few days to come in, but he called me right away.  The staff at Groove Mazda especially Jason and Sarah can take the sourest of kumquats or most cantankerous of customers and help them find the right fit with a friendly no-pressure touch.  Lisa helped me figure out finances the first day, yet Alex really helped answer more questions and worked his magic to help me get the best deals possible.  I appreciate all of their help and just love my new car.  A week in and I am still figuring out some of the buttons and how to lock my hatch, but know where to come for assistance and a friendly face. The CX5 Touring has great ratings and I have just added another one.",5
2508, on 09/19/17 14:40 PM (PDT),Silv ,2017 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Luxury on a budget!," My previous vehicle was slowly cleaning out my bank account and my confidence (2005 Buick Terraza aka life-curse aka money pit). I started shopping around for something new as I had never owned a brand new car before. I knew I wanted something in the SUV cross-over class and I set my sights on the 2017 Honda CR-v initially. I felt I better compare and see what other brands had to offer, so I test drove the Rogue, Quashqai (aka rouge sport), HR-v, Tucson, and finally, CX-5.  Man oh man, did CX-5 ever blindside me. It was no contest really, once I took that baby for a spin it was love at first ride. The quality feel was unmatched by all the others and while its not ultra powerful it's certainly zippy enough for my needs and handles like a dream. I bought it with confidence and haven't had a moment of doubt with it since. I hope it holds up over time, and being the second generation of already popular CX-5 designs I'm certain it will. I'm really not a fan of the new Soul Red colour, so I got mine in Deep Crystal Blue Mica and it just shimmers beautifully in the sun and looks sleek, almost black in the shade. The exterior has a mean looking grill with sleek LED headlights and I love that they turn with the corners while driving. The leather interior and all the knobs, buttons, and displays are of a quality I would have expected to see in a lexus or audi and went unmatched by all the other cars I test drove. Rear heated seats were a nice touch too! I'm so proud of my new CX-5 as a first time new car purchase and I just felt really good about the entire experience overall. I would re-buy it again in a heartbeat!",5

The interior of the CX5 compares with that of far more expensive vehicles.

We had a good test drive, no problem.  However after picking up the one we ordered and driving it about 10 miles were were slowing down for a flagger at a road repair situation.  Just as we got to the flagger he stepped in front of the car to move the sign from slow to stop.  Don't know what went wrong but thankfully we were going slow and had my foot on the break but as the man stepped in front of the car the car revved up to 4000rpm.  I immediately put the car into park but the engine wouldn't slow down so I had to turn the engine totally off.   It was a dangerous situation and could easily have ended in disaster.  When the flagger waved us forward I started the car and drove a bit up the road....called the dealer and had them pick the car up.

I have always purchased used vehicles in the as I am not one to take the significant depreciation hit of new cars lightly, but the combination of an excellent interior, all the tech features you can ask for combined with great gas mileage were enough to sway me to purchase new. One of my main concerns prior to purchasing the vehicle was that it would feel woefully under powered, fortunately this has not been the case. Coming from a driver who has only had 6 cylinder vehicles in the past and places a premium on good acceleration, I must admit the small displacement engine in the Mazda is more than adequate for everyday use. I have not been left wanting for more power at any point. That isn't to say more power wouldn't make this an even better car but nonetheless what Mazda gives you is plenty. I must admit the main selling point for me was the interior and technology. The fact that you get such good quality materials as well as safety features that are implemented in a way that I felt were superior to other brands I tested including luxury models is truly surprising. Do yourself a favor and try one out in the higher trim levels before going off and buying a significantly more expensive luxury sedan or SUV, you'll be pleasantly surprised at what Mazda has to offer.",5

I've narrowed my choices down to the CX-5 Grand Touring and the Hyundai Tuscon Limited.  Love the sleek look of the CX-5 inside and out.  Some features missing that Hyundai offers are panoramic moonroof, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and Apple Car Play (though Mazda says Apple Car Play is coming).  I love the look and the driving feel of the CX-5 over the Tuscon but I love those added comfort and convenience features that the Tuscon offers over the CX-5.  Still waiting to see which car maker if either can fill in the gap between the two first.  Will wait to see what comes from both in 2018 and 2019.",4

The car still handles pretty much the same and is fun to drive, although I find the new model to be a bit more sluggish in shifting gears. They need a larger engine option.  I still get the same mileage- about 24.5 city and 28.6 highway (75 mph).  I don't like the new front grill, cup holder placement, higher front hood which means lower visibility for short people., lac k of arm rests and the navigation system is horrid.  The city assist braking system only works in very specific situations, and is not that helpful. Also the side mirror alerts are overly sensitive, and go off even when a car is maybe 8 lengths away from you.    That said, I still prefer the way this car handles and the upgraded interior when compared to similarly priced competition.  The sound system is pretty good, and with lower cabin noise,  is pleasant to use during long drive",3

I liked engine response of Ford escape and Fun and premium feel of Mazda. Finally chose CX-5 over Escape. CX-5 Performance is adequate,It matches 0-45 against my traded in V6 Altima.   Out of these four cars CRV was the boring one.  My only problem with Mazda is its driver memory positions does not set side mirrors. Navigation and blind spot alert is integrated with HUD and it is awesome. I love the turning headlights.  Overall very satisfied.",5
2520, on 07/12/17 17:25 PM (PDT),Sonny ,2017 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),What a Sweet Ride - Mazda has done a wonderful job," We traded in a Honda 2016 CRV EXL and also test drove the new 2017 CRV Touring - which can not compare to the CX5 as far as the technology and we hated the cheap looking interior of the CRV - who designed the tinny looking steering wheel controls? THe CX5 handled so much better on the road - steered better-quieter-and handled bumpy roads way better , the Bose Stereo is just awesome , the center knob for the entertainment screen is wonderful.  Mazda's lane assist , headlights that move around the corners , the cruise control with assist, a interior that is pure luxury compared to the Honda.  The Red Soul Color has no comparison.  So if you haven't driven a new CX5 please do so before buying anything else in this class of vehicle.  Also Mazda's dealership is awesome no pushing to purchase a vehicle which probably is due to the fact that nothing compares to their new CX5Update one year later -   Car is still awesome only 1 flaw -  THE PAINT SUCKS!  Think twice about the Crystal Red Soul Color - we have experienced way to many paint chips especially on the hood -  Also BE extremely careful when removing pine sap , road tar , squashed bugs etc.  - if you rub really hard you will remove the clear coat and be stuck with dull areas with fine line scratches -   I am used to really being able to scrub on my car surfaces with out causing any damage -   this pisses me off so much that I very well may trade this vehicle -  When I ask Mazda dealership about all the road chips they act like it is the first time they have ever heard about the Red Soul Color Chipping - Mazda should of tested the paint process and durability before allowing their cars to be sold",5

The CX-5 beat them all out and in particular beat the CRV with better controls (not as dependent on a touch screen), better acceleration and driving dynamics.

Best in class!," 2017 Mazda -5 GT, premium package. 5 STARSSearching for a mid size Crossover, I narrowed my choices down to the Mazda CX-5 and the Lexus NX 200t. I need a spare tire for long road trips. Surprisingly, many premium brands delete this. I am a long time Lexus owner, with my last 13 cars being Lexus. I currently have an ES and a GS. The NX was the easy choice, until I started researching the Mazda CX-5. Although these two vehicles are in a different price category, they are very similar in size and capabilities. What interesting is the Mazda for me was the better choice. The CX-5 is very smooth and quiet. The interior materials are actually superior to the Lexus, and the fit and finish of the Mazda is easily on par with any Lexus vehicle. Where the Mazda really shines is safety. The GT with premium package has all the latest technology with Blind Spot monitoring, Lane departure and assist, pre collision with auto braking, etc. What’s is really interesting is that this is all displayed on the HUD right in front of you. It warns you if you are too close to the car in front of you. It duplicates the blind spot monitors. It shows you your current speed and speed limit. It shows you navigation and turn directions. Its very advanced, and exceptional in this price range. The Lexus NX has none of this for $15k more. This may change for Lexus when the ‘18 model comes out. The Mazda uses regular fuel and gets better gas mileage. The Mazda rides smoother and quieter. My CX-5 has no rattles and feels very solid. The NX service loaners that I have driven, all had rattles from the rear hatch.  I like the Mazda design better, but thats subjective. So what does the Lexus have for $15k more? A turbo for more power ( but uses premium fuel), parking sensors, ventilated seats, and telematics. So far I’m really happy with my CX-5. There have no problems or defects, and I actually enjoy driving it. I think this car is the best going in this category and price range. If Mazda put the turbo from the CX-9 in it, it would beat many premium crossovers costing $20k more. Maybe the diesel coming later this year will change that. A little more “zoom-zoom” would be good. Any complaints? I wish the driver’s seat would move a few more inches back ( I’m 6’2”),  and it has older style tire pressure monitors that just tell you if a tire is low (as opposed to showing you the exact pressure in each tire). Thats about it. Check this car out and you will be surprised at the value here. Its an excellent vehicle that punches above its class.",5

It came down to the CX-5 and Jeep. He was leaning towards the Jeep until he drove the CX-5. We got it in the machine gray with the parchment interior and the premium package. We've had many high end European cars, the fit and finish of the CX-5 is very impressive. The handling and look of SUV is what sold it to him. It comes with a ton of safety features. Although the graphics on the navigation system are a bit dated, it works very well. Voice recognition is better then most of the cars we have and the sound system is very good as well.

Everyone who has ridden in it regardless of age or size has been very impressed including tall back seat passangers.  Already hauling stuff in it and it has more usuable cargo space than I expected.  Haven't had a single problem but it's too soon (5 weeks) to really comment on reliability.  Wish automakers could/would make AWD autos with better gas mileage - Tesla might have to be my next car - but this performs with the rest of its class and I couldn't dream up a better car.  Great job Mazda engineers!!!  Go get one for yourself.....,5

2528, on 06/02/17 09:29 AM (PDT),stlpilot ,2017 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Forget the CRV," My wife and I test drove the 2017 CRV EXL, which has wonderful reviews, and the car felt ""ok"" to us.  There was nothing really exciting about the CRV, except for the cargo space and remote starter.  One week later, we test drove the 2017 CX-5 GT, and we were both very impressed.  The interior is gorgeous, doors thump just like a German car, and the car feels substantial on the road.  My wife made a comment how she felt tuned and ""one"" with the car while driving it.  I was likely impressed with the quality of the car and felt the power was adequate although, this car could be made near perfect by adding a turbocharger or a slightly more powerful engine.  So overall, this is a clear winner between the CRV and the CX-5.  We decided to wait few months until Apple Carplay comes out on the CX-5 before we purchase this car.  As a long-time Honda owner, my suggestion to all of you out there is go out there at least test drive this car.  You will be pleasantly surprised with the driving dynamics and overall fit and finish of the cabin.  However, if you are looking at more cargo and rear seat space, look at the CRV, which will be much better suited for this.",5
2529, on 06/02/17 05:16 AM (PDT),Jeff B ,2017 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),More zoom-zoom than your typical compact SUV," If money was no object, I'd be driving a Porsche Cayenne S. But since my current car budget did not have room for a $90K SUV (and the associated high maint costs), I feel I did the next best thing and got a Mazda CX-5 GT with prem pkg. No, it's not nearly as fast as a Cayenne, but for about a third the the price, this little SUV acts a lot like that Swabian icon of the road. This is my second CX5. I had a 2013 as well. The 2017 is a HUGE upgrade from the 2013 model. I got my new one in Soul Red Crystal, and it literally glows! Love it. The 2017 is MUCH quieter inside than the earlier model, and compared to even a new Honda CRV, or a Ford Escape, the Mazda is quieter and more composed on the road, and handles much better than those rivals. Although the stability control is a little too aggressive for my taste, you can still toss this thing around like a sports sedan and not worry about the suspension getting flabby & floppy on you. It just tracks beautifully and handles mid corner bumps with aplomb (just like the Cayenne). If your main goal is having a lot of interior room & cargo space, go for the CRV (which is MUCH roomier) but in every other aspect I can think of, the Mazda scores higher. The Honda is more like a nice mini-van, disguised as an SUV. Sure it's roomy and peppy, but it in no way rewards the enthusiast driver like the Mazda. The parchment leather interior is just gorgeous, and looks much nicer than (for example) the interior in a BMW X3 or X5. Mazda obsessed over every little detail in this car. I was a bit concerned that I might not like all the ""active safety"" features, but they are so well done and so well integrated into the operation of the vehicle, that it was easy to get used to, and now I miss them in my other cars. With about 1100 miles on the clock I am averaging 26.9mpg. I do not do much urban driving, but still I am very happy with that result. I expect this result will improve as the engine breaks in. (Over 4 years I averaged 28.4mpg in my 2013 CX5). In short, if you want a ""driver's car"" but need the room and practicality of an SUV get the CX5 -- unless of course you can spring for the Cayenne :)",5
2530, on 05/23/17 15:32 PM (PDT),Pamela ,2017 Mazda CX-5  Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),"Love performance, hate the new exterior design", I currently own a 2014 Touring CX-5 and love it! I was considering trading it for the 2017 until I saw it in the show room. I was shocked at how much they had changed the exterior. It now looks more like the CX-9. What I really liked about the CX-5 was the fact that it was a small crossover SUV. It no longer looks like a crossover. The new design is ugly and too big. They totally ruined the appearance of this car. I'm so disappointed!,3
2531, on 05/20/17 08:13 AM (PDT),James Lewis ,2017 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),2017's best automotive bargain!," My wife waited 4 months for this car to come out and we are glad she did.  Mazda listened to the automotive community on just about everything they criticized and made changes accordingly, not that there any show stoppers with the 2016 version.  To me, it looks like they copied a lot of the best things from the european SUVs to make this car an amazing bargain.   The interior is so nice it would make an Audi or BMW blush in comparison.  And let's face it, that's where you spend your time.  Just as well, as the exterior is still a toad in my opinion, despite Mazda's effort to make you think otherwise.  Our Grand Touring version, with the sunroof and upgrade sound system option package, has all the latest bells and whistles that we need; the only thing it doesn't do is park itself.  But with a back up camera, if you can't parallel park, perhaps your proficiency needs to be addressed???  The sound system is by Bose, and as expected, is a waste of money.  A bog stock late model Dodge mini van's sound system (have one at work) destroys this car's system.  But then again, I have only heard one factory system as good as the Dodge's, and that was in a bone stock Jeep Grand Cherokee Loredo...  Makes me wonder if Chrysler has cracked to code on audio hifi and none of the auto rags has noticed or cared, as they don't spill ink on that subject.   The engine doesn't compare to anything Honda makes.  It's large displacement 4 cylinder lacks that sewing machine smoothness you would expect to have in such a nice vehicle.  And the mileage and power isn't anything to brag about either.  The average we get is about 31 MPG, and if pushed past 70 on the highway will get less than that.  Some of this I blame on the use of a 6 speed automatic, I suspect the rest is attributed to aerodynamics similar of a barn door...  As much as I don't like driving with a variable ratio transmission system like Honda and Nissan utilizes,  I personally find it very easy to get great mileage with that system, just by paying attention to the sound and feel of the drivetrain.  Mazda:  If you are going to stick with a traditional automatic, more gears are needed now to stay competitive.  It's too bad they didn't provide the option of the turbo motor from the CX-9; that would make this vehicle unbeatable.  But Mazda has always had issue with providing killer options in the engine department; for proof look no further than the Miata.   All of this is nitpicking.  Dont walk away without taking a close look and a test drive.  If you buy this car like we did, every time you drive it you will marvel at how Mazda provides so much vehicle for so little money.   Amazing.",5

Also each of the cars I purchased was the same color a Silver Gray. The odds of buying not only the same  car, same model and basically the same color are extremely  rare and that speaks for it's self as to how good the car is.

I never had a complaint. It was reliable, stable on wet/snow covered roads, comfortable, easy to handle, great vision through the multiple large windows. The 2016 Touring is no comparison. I can't drive it because of the bubbled hood and bubbled out sides that extend 15"" beyond the side view mirrors. Lack of vision of the edges of  the car has come close to causing 3 accidents. The navigation system is a joke. We've supposedly reached ""our destination"" in the middle of the Verrazano Bridge. Bluetooth is intermittent and frequently drops calls. Resale value, although the car is in near-perfect condition (one bumper ding), has dropped by 35% over 1.5 years. In other words, we're stuck with it. Worst car purchase of my 45-year driving life. Salesman yapped about his family for so long that tech support had left for the evening. The man knew absolutely nothing about the technicalities and intricacies of the car.

We contacted the local Honda repair that said, before ever looking at it, that it sounded like a rodent had gotten to it. We took it to our ""family"" mechanic who said the fuel line had a hole but did not see it as a rodent damage and he could repair for $740. We then spoke to corporate customer service and They would refer to a supervisor but wanted diagnostic from the Honda dealership so we paid a tow of $80 to get it there.Sure enough it was diagnosed as rodent damage. We spoke with supervisor at corporate who basically read a script and was generally rude to my wife. I understand it was not under warranty - barely - but to be rude, and assuming in the case of the service department, displayed very little care or concern for us the customer. They want over $1300 for repairs. We are now working to get insurance to cover it while we are without our car. At least the local dealer is providing a loaner while this is all worked through with our insurance.  This is my first and will be my last Honda ever. Even found online that a recall was done on 25,000 2017 CR-Vs for fuel line leaks and there is a pending law suit related to strong odor of gas in Hondas, which Honda denies is any problem.

Otherwise this vehicle is very dangerous on curvy roads and on highways. Any attempt at higher speed, 65 mile an hour breaking or turning is quite dangerous. The brakes are non responsive and the body roll is excessive. Additionally, the front seats are horribly uncomfortable, there is virtually no usable cargo space up front and the headlights on low beam give no side illuminations.

If you live in DFW don't go there, the sales staff is incompetent and lack knowledge. I have only had for less than a month and so far there are 3 things I hate about this car: (1) No push button or remote tail gate lift? seriously Honda, it's a basic feature which should come standard with the EX trim. My sales person lied and miss-sold me on this feature otherwise I probably wouldn't have bought this vehicle. (2) Interior storage, not many compartments to put stuff in the front especially the driver side, my Honda Civic has more storage compartments than this CR-V. (3) Poor road holding and handling.

If you don't think you'll miss it, make yourself not use the one in your existing car and see if you miss it. Had a 1995 that even had it in there! Asked dealer (after I bought it) where it was & they said the only model that has it is the touring model. The back-up system is so generic, compared to Ford's. When you back up with theirs, the visual is green (ok), yellow (getting closer) & red (you're right on top); the audio is beep beep (ok), beep, beep, beep (getting closer), & BEEP BEEP BEEP (you're right on top). Honda has no audio and bare bone yellow-no comparison. I'm short and although I try not to hit my knee when I get in, I'm frequently nailing it on the console below & to the L of the steering column, also hit my head a lot on the top. The radio is horrible! the buttons are SO small (& I've got little fingers) I'm constantly hitting the wrong buttons while driving, which throws the thing into la-la land; no matter how much I practice on it, it's a pain & I despise it. Car doesn't do well in high winds for handling. Also sounds like the tires are out of round if it isn't driven every day. The AC and heating system take forever to cool/heat. For a $32K car, I would not buy another. I do, however, like the way the seats lie down in the back...that's what initially attracted me to it plus I've owned Honda's since 1985; still have my 2005 Honda which I gave to my son for high school graduation as he'll be using it to and from college. Feel like giving him the CRV but have payments...if I could do it over, I'd buy another Accord. My husband wanted me to buy a SUV since we already had a new Taurus, the Accord and a pick up.

Additionally, when going downhill, the Honda will stay in the same gear, straining a bit; so I have to give it a little gas to get it to shift into a better gear.  Also, no volume knob For the radio!

2559, on 04/30/17 12:42 PM (PDT),Chuck P. ,2016 Honda CR-V  LX 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Horrible Engine Vibration," The engine in this 2016 CRV vibrates considerably while stopped in drive and foot on the brake. The front seats vibrate to a point that causes my legs to go numb. The doors and center console vibrates, as well as the dash which is creating a noise from the dash/steering column area. The dealership says this is normal, but I wonder what component/s this vibration will cause to come loose later on--electrical connections, fuel line connections, a/c connections, etc. (not to mention my legs)? I bought this CRV because of a presumed reputation, but am left gravely disappointed. I will never buy or recommend Honda vehicles.",2

Try another vehicle!," I financed a CRV SE in September 2016 and two days or so after having the car I had to go back to the dealer complaining about this vibration that is only felt when the car is idle or when stopped at a light and/or traffic. I feel very disappointed in Honda for not having a fixable solution to this problem. The dead just tells that ""it's a V4 what you are experiencing/feeling it's normal"" there no way in hell that you can say that a car that's clearly vibrating and that you as the ""tech or mechanics"" is also feel that there's something not right on the vehicle you can tell me it's normal!!! The worst part is that they tell me that they can get me into another car but it's going to put me a negative equity or something thing like that which means that they are going to give me a quote on how much the CRV is valued as of now and they are going to deduct what the consider out it and then I'll owe the rest! Totally not fair.. I feel that as a ""respectable"" brand as Honda should have more respect and transparency with its customers and fully advice them of this problem! But, that's not all the ""AWD""crap is BS.. I had such a hard time driving in the snow this Winter and to make it worst I was stuck!!!   In the snow. I had to get out and shovel my way out and just so you know I have a bad back! No it's totally unfair to be paying all that money to get into a car that's not even going to give you half of what you are paying for, so do yourself a favor and don't buy a CRV..",1
2562, on 04/06/17 08:38 AM (PDT),Renay Rodriguez ,2016 Honda CR-V  EX-L 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),A Great Car - Horrible Comfort, I will never buy another CRV again unless Honda decides to fix the interior car seat design. After owning the car for 6 months I now have a permanent shoulder and neck injury from driving this vehicle. The headrest is so far forward that it causes curvature right at the base of the neck into the mid spine area. As a result of being constantly curved you begin to develop next train with creates muscle tightness in the neck which is now resulted in tingling and numbness in two my hands. I tried turning the headrest around and felt infinitely more comfortable but it's not safe because there's no support in case of an accident. An additional problem is the bottom part of the seats themselves even at 5 to the seats are too short. As a result you don't get any support behind your legs. And this creates neck and back strain as well as you are required to support your own legs throughout the drive with just your bottom on the seat. I drive a car to drive and go places and this car has been miserable.  Another reason not to ever buy this car again is the road noise. You can barely talk on your cell phone in this car when you're on the highway because the road and wind noise is so loud. You cannot listen to music comfortably in this car because you have to blast it so loud in order to be able to hear the music over the wind and road noise. When I bought this car I was thinking great gas mileage reliability and safety. But I didn't think about Comfort because I assumed a car company like Honda as reputable as they are would have created seats that would have been comfortable.,3

I am paying for a car that I cannot safely drive. Prolonged exposure to gasoline fumes can lead to a variety of medical issues.

(2) brakes make a creaking sound.   dealership says its normal due to weather. (3) the parking/backup camera is blurred when it rains so you really cant see what is behind you.  makes this feature more or less useless.   (4) front drivers seat gets uncomfortable if riding for any length of time.  (5)  CD player setup is kinda ""dumb"".  you have to push the button to raise the display screen to get access to the CD slot.

Two of us bought the Rogue. The CRV was a big surprise as we were expecting great things. Performance was sluggish, compared to the others, the ride and noise in the rear seat unacceptable and the touch screen which controls everything a nightmare. Our experienced sales person took 5 touch strokes to turn on the radio and select a station! We couldn't live with the integrated touch screen system for music, climate control and navigation. When we asked about a CD player the salesperson touched a button and the entire integrated screen popped out from the dash and rotated 90 degrees exposing the CD slot in the metal work behind the screen. Try managing a CD change while driving....I think not. Looks like a repair nightmare if you buy this vehicle.

The driver's  seat  comfort is my greatest issue. I have added a foam cushion to the backrest, without it I cannot drive the car because my back aches. (I don't have that issue with any other vehicles I own). The audio system is just a PIA to operate. Road noise is terrible.Have decided to ditch this car ASAP. Bought 2016 CR-V EX. as the replacement of a 2006 Hyundai Tucson Limited.  I considered the Mazda CX5 but hesitated because I couldn't find long term data results for the SkyActiv engine. Was unimpressed with the RAV4 and the Ford Escape. After 2 weeks with the Honda I regret the decision. No matter what I do I cannot get comfortable in the driver's seat, The car has power adjust seats but no position is satisfying.  I am 5' 8"" and 190lb. The seat is wrong at the lumbar no matter deflated or inflated,- hard on the butt , poor conforming  and feels to narrow across the back,  just terrible.  Not looking forward to a long trip in the saddle. Road noise volume is unbelievable, It came with BridgeSTONE tires, I never had them on a vehicle.  I am hoping that once they wear out, a set of Dunlop's will improve the noise level. Obviously the roof has NO sound proofing because during a heavy rain the sound was brutal. The audio system has no possibility for satellite radio. The Bluetooth is spotty. The displays are minimal in choice. The gas mileage has been great, With the ECO  off the car has adequate power, when on NO. There is no doubt this is a four cylinder when you give it the whip, but it's OK.   Handling is good, wheel feel is good. Transmission is smooth. Hope to never experience diabetic neuropathy in the feet,  gas and brake pedals are very close together and have at the same time hit both a few times, confident I will get used to this.  Not thrilled with this car, hoping that opinion changes in the next 150,000 miles.",3

Meanwhile, my F150 just runs like a clock!Update:  Have owned the car for 2 years now.  Have been having continuous problem with the low tire pressure indicator giving false low tire warnings after replacing one tire - a very stressful thing for the driver when this happens.  Dealer shrugs shoulders, makes lame excuses about how the sensors are not wheel mounted and one tire effects all others, taller new tire, etc.  A new TSB just came out so hopefully it works.

I am 53 years of age and with all the kids out of the house, I now focus on my hobbies which include, camping, fishing, kayaking, surfing and hiking with my medium sized terrier.  I traded in my Volvo for this car and had to adjust to a couple of downgrade issues as a result.  The stereo basically sucks.  Even the Ex-L version which supposedly has an upgraded stereo.  Compared to the BOSE system that came standard in my Volvo, this one is just not good.  I will echo the sentiment by many others.  The ride is pretty loud.  It took a bit of time for me to get used to the road noise in the cabin but it really isn't so bad that one cannot get used to it.  Other than that, this car beats my Volvo hands down.  The AWD and high clearance are a blessing in the rugged outdoors of the PNW.  The large cargo space holds all my fishing, camping, surfing and kayaking gear and even my bike. I have used it to tow lightweight kayak trailers and it behaves great.  The right side mirror camera is an amazing feature.  Recently I took this car all the way from Oregon to PA and back again averaging 29ish mpg.  The cargo space became a sleeping space and I dubbed it the C.R.V. (compact RV).  The most striking thing about this car (selling point for me) is how it handles the roads in any conditions.  It handled high winds across the plains and accelerated quickly enough to pass even on the 80 mph freeways in the midwest and the AWD kicks in on snow and sand.  No problems on that trip.  In fact in 22k miles I have not had to spend one cent on anything except oil change.  Contrast that to my Volvo where I had easily spent over 1k in repairs by that many miles.  For the purchase price and for the peace of mind I have behind the wheel, this car wins all around.",5

The notice mentioned that, ""the software in the PCM causes a low pressure problem in the CVT. This may allow the belt in the CVT to slip. If the belt slips, you may see a surge in RPM when driving at highway speeds. If the belt slips the transmission will be damaged and DTC P1890 (the CVT speed control system) will set."" The software update was completed about a month ago and since then, I have experienced a more pronounced vibration under my driver's seat and even into the front passenger seat. The intensity of the vibration varies, but it has not gone away. Now that I have hit the 5K mile mark and had my first service done, I am afraid that the older the transmission gets, the worse this problem might become. The service advisor told me that the software update had nothing to do with the vibration issue, but I am not convinced. Before buying this vehicle, my research indicated that many customers with the 2015 model started to report the vibration issue right around this time (5K miles + or around the first scheduled service) and for most, the problem became worse. I am convinced that these issues are related to the new CVT transmission that was put in the 2015 and 2016 models. I have always been loyal to the Honda brand and I really like my vehicle, but I am starting to regret my purchase!!! :-(",3

The ride is very comfortable and quiet. It handles GREAT on the road. Gas mileage is average. Rear window visibility is a little impaired by its size and the rear seat headrests.

2613, on 01/31/18 08:35 AM (PST),Ben ,2016 Toyota RAV4  LE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Very Solid Compact SUV," This car is not what I would call interesting, but it is very good at what it does. First, the interior of the base model is very good in my opinion. The front seats in this car are very comfortable they hug your sides even if you are of a more slender build. The leg room in the front seats is very good. I'm six feet tall, and there is still more room to move the seat back. The back seats have decent leg room as well, I would be comfortable riding in the back seats of this car for a long car trip. Storage in this car is also very good. I use this vehicle to carry music gear to all of my shows. I can fit a 4x8 bass cabinet, 2 guitar amps, 6 guitars, a six way guitar stand, a few effects pedals, mics and stands. With all of this there is still enough room to comfortably fit 3 people in the vehicle. 2 in the front, one in the 40 split in the back seat. The performance of this car is solid. I would not call this car fast, cause it's not, but the engine has plenty of power to merge on the highway, and move in and out of traffic. The steering on this car is also very good. It is light when making parking maneuvers, but tightens up when cornering more aggressively. I drove this car in the snow/ice this winter and it does fairly well. The traction control system is surprisingly good and getting the car to grip up in worse than ideal conditions.  Visibility in this car is good, The back window is harder to see out of then I would like, but the back up camera comes as standard in this vehicle, which is pretty useful. The mirrors are excellent with the blind spot mirrors in the corners, there is virtually no blind spot when adjusted correctly. The transmission is fairly good, but I honestly just don't like automatic transmissions coming from driving a 5 speed for 6 years before this car.  The Bluetooth in the car works very well for playing music I don't use it for much else. The text reading options kind of suck and the menus for the screens though logical take too many steps, but I'm driving a car so I usually don't mess with them any how. The steering wheel has a nice feel to it and the controls don't clutter it up too much. Fuel economy is good in this car. I usually get about 26 mpg when I fill up, that is usually mostly city driving and I tend to be a faster driver in general so I think that is pretty good. As for the quality of the interior, I would say it is good, I have black cloth seats, and they look nice, and the fabric breathes quite well, so even in hot Kentucky summers the car isn't unbearably warm. No mechanical issues with this car so far, it was a rental car that had 42k miles on it when I bought it so I figured it lived a tough life before I got it, but seems to have suffered no damage during that time. This vehicle is very easy to change the oil on if you were wondering. Everything is located underneath towards the front and with the large amount of ground clearance I can change the oil without putting it on jacks.",4

I'm more than satisfied with all the features, the look, reliability, value and how it's known for holding its value, fuel efficiency, hands free calling, back up camera, and primarily with the way it hugs the road, and has a small car driving feel to it. I'm petite, and it doesn't feel like I'm driving a big vehicle I can't control. Although I'm petite, my kids and husband are tall, and they have a lot of leg room in the front and back with some to spare, which is nice. The only feature it doesn't have that I need at some point is a navigation system that links up with my phone. I'm sure newer models or the upgraded models have it, but my 2016 LE model does not. I bought a CPO, and love that I have the warranty available if I need it. Sheridan at Mountain states Toyota was more than helpful and even threw in new floor mats for my pre-owned SUV. Overall, I'm more than Satisfied. Thank you again Sheridan for making my vehicle buying experience a delightful one!",5

We purchased a 2016 Limited for my wife because she liked the looks and safety features.  The RAV is the probably the most disappointing car we have ever owned.  It is great on paper, but real life experience falls short of expectations.  Biggest issues are: 1) Very harsh / stiff ride.  Even small road imperfections translate into sharp, jarring bumps.  2) Uncomfortable seats.  Front seats are tiny and badly shaped.  I'm 5'7, 155 lb, and even being average-sized I feel like sitting on a chair designed for a child or a midget.  Rear seats aren't any better - flat and hard, like a wooden bench.  3) Noise.  Toyota improved the engine noise issue (which was terrible in the 2013 model), but road noise is still very bad.  I can hear every car around me - it's like riding with open windows.  Interior materials feel cheap.  Overall, the RAV feels like riding in a cheap $15k sub-compact, not a $30k SUV.  Very disappointing, and probably the last Toyota we will buy (after 5 other).  NOT RECOMMENDED.",2

The ride is so stiff and firm that you can feel virtually every bump in the road. It's harsh, jarring, and so uncomfortable. If you are driving on anything but perfectly even pavement, it will feel extremely rough. Like many, I bought the car because I have a very outdoorsy lifestyle, i.e. frequent trips to trails, forest roads, etc. The Rav simply could not keep up; the suspension design is AWFUL--it slams over bumps and feels very bouncy and unstable. There were frequent rattles from the cheap plastic on the interior, which drove me nuts, and the AWD was sub par at best. I would not recommend this vehicle for anyone who likes to venture outside of city limits. Unfortunately, I also believe that the brake system is flawed- they often felt ""spongey"" and unresponsive. I was experiencing excessive vibration while braking at 20K, and found out that I had completely warped/worn rotors. A practically new vehicle should not require a repair like that.",2

The front seat has a ""lumbar support"" that digs into my back just above my belt line. I've adjusted the seat every which way possible. I've tried after market seat cushions and pillows to no avail.  I wanted to give this vehicle a chance because there are many things to like about it compared against the other cars I've test driven. I will lose money when I rid myself of it after only 3 months.   Otherwise, I like the smooth power delivery and most notably the quality of the interior. It comes without a lot of frills that come standard on some competitors,  like adjustable speed intermittent wipers, automatic headlights, and push button start but it has a high quality feel.  The interior switches and the fit and finish are top notch. This is why I bought it. IF YOU HAVE ANY BACK PROBLEMS, OR EVEN IF YOU DON'T, TAKE  A LONG TERM TEST DRIVE OR RENT ONE FIRST.

Nice. For a small suv, great cargo space and overall roominess. The powertrain is really great and smooth up to about 35 and accelerates nicely. But get this thing going faster and the engine seems to really labor, buzz unpleasantly, and the transmission seems to get confused, searching for gears then delivering some really hard shifts. The trip display computer is not as intuitive as those in other cars. Lots of wind noise from the windshield. Ride was very good and there were no rattles or squeaks, good considering it was old by rental car standards, pushing 30k. The freeway ride was a little unsettling in that steering was imprecise and floaty. the driving position was pretty good, but would have appreciated a seat that raised up a little higher and the console armrest was too far back to be useful with a hand on the wheel. Ergonomically, it gets a big F just for the window switches alone. your left arm almost has to reach awkwardly around the door handle to get to the power windows. Bad design here. No long term review as I only drove it for three days, but probably wouldn't buy it. Brake pedal modulation was terrible. you have to push the pedal a few inches with no resistance or response whatsoever, then a sudden grab.",3

2623, on 04/16/17 06:31 AM (PDT),Don Robitaille ,2016 Toyota RAV4  XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Very Disappointed....," Do your homework and don't trust the brochures. First of all this is a hybrid XLE. I was the proud and happy owner of 2 Camry hybrid XLE's since 2006. Both of the Camry's had automatic headlights. The brochure stated that the 2016 RAV 4 also had automatic headlights and I also expected that in the XLE model. To make a long story short it doesn't have automatic headlights.  The gas mileage is horrible for a hybrid at 24-25 mpg. The on board computer shows 27.2 mpg. But when you divide total mileage by gallons of gas at a fill up it comes out to 25 mpg give or take a few tenths of a gallon. Never comes close to the alleged mpg on the display. The road noise at 50+ mph is very poor. I have to keep checking that all the windows are tightly closed and they are. The contacts in the telephone display disappear at random, usually once a month and I have to reset my phone to the vehicle via bluetooth. Toyota did an update to fix the problem and a month later all my contacts disappeared again. There are other problems, but this is enough for now. I loved my Camry Hybrids and I can't wait to get rid of this RAV 4. I don't think I would even buy another Toyota after this experience and I was their best ambassador as a Camry owner. The latest negative and once again shame on me is during a warm day with passengers in the back seat complaining how warm it was, I had the AC on in the front seat, I told them they had there own controls  to turn it on in the back seat area ( my previous Camry's had the separate controls for the back. They said we don't see anything, I pulled over to show them and to my embarrassment they were right. There was no AC in the back and they spent the rest of the ride sweltering. All my telephone contacts are still disappearing at random after 2 alleged software updates at Toyota. The sticker said the average gas mileage is a combined 33 mpg. The on board computer claims I'm getting 27.9 mpg. When you do it the old way of keeping track of your mileage and dividing the number of gallons on a fill up it is around 25 mpg. My Toyota days are over !",2

Had a 1996 Civic Dx coupe manual transmission, am/fm radio, no ac, crank windows for 273,000 miles, 8 years.  Liked it.  Always wanted an Accord, got 2015 Accord Sport sedan, 6speed manual, liked, techy, slightly cheap plastic.  Toyotas are sleepers, in my opinion.  Had 2010 Prius III, just after the redesign, 2011 Camry Base, 2014.5 Camry LE.  Liked them all, but in a different way than my Hondas.  Easy to live with.  Prius wasn't fun to drive.  Seat angled weird, like you were pointed toward the central gauges, but you body was traveling straight.  Weird.  Camrys were solid.  Comfortable.  Easy to live with.  This is easy to live with.  I like it.  I like sitting up high.  I have the LE AWD.  Came home to find frozen into 2 feet of snow at jfk after having been in southern California, no problem.  Rocked it back and forth a couple of times, drove right out.  Impressive.  Very peaceful.  Doesn't rip around, so I drive it slow, and it works for me.  Very well balanced in many ways.  Fabric on seats in Accord was shiny.  Fancy.  Like an executive's car.  This is basic.  Perfect balance between comfort, and durability.  Doesn't advertise itself, ""Hey, look at me!"", just gets the job done in a very nice way.  Keep it in ECO mode, get advertised milage.  Satisfied with MPG.  Without ECO button on, takes off a little too quick in first gear, in my opinion.  Had 2014 Kia Sportage LX, was a dog in ECO mode.  Sporty, and tight handling otherwise.  This gets better feel economy, and feels more satisfying, overall.  The Kia felt less satisfying to drive with time.  This got better with time.  Toyota's reliable, too, good to do business with.  I got a great lease deal.  Paid out of some negative equity I had after trading  a lot of vehicles in a short time.  This allows me to pay that off, plus lease the vehicle, get a fresh start at the end of the lease.  Surprised Toyota would offer it.  Recommended.",5

However after a year of driving it we have noticed the following shortcomings:•	Gas mileage is not that good-sticker says 22/29 and we have never come close. We are lucky to get 25 mpg on a highway trip. •	The hood is so rounded that you cannot see the front of the car and thus never know if you are far enough into a parking space and it is difficult to keep centered in your lane.•	The roof is so rounded that snow falls on the seat every time you open the door.•	The back window is tiny and so rounded in every direction that you cannot clean it with a squeegee.•	The gas gauge is highly inaccurate-says empty when you have more than a quarter of a tank. (Both analog and digital readout)•	The huge emergency brake takes up so much of the center console which is probably the reason there are so few inside storage compartments•	The radio fades in and out (toyota keeps saying they can fix it, but never do)•	Lots of road noiseIt does handle as well as the Subaru in the snow but the bottom line is that we will probably go back to Subaru very soon.",2

On the positive side, the automatic braking assist has already helped in traffic! Thank you Toyota. And I love my dealer's service team.

Cons - Gas mileage, around 21.5 combined (L.A.), a little noisy, front brakes (and this has never happened to me) won't last too long. I haven't needed brakes since cars I owned in the late 1980's. I trade them in around 35k-50k mileage. So this is a design flaw in the Toyota ESPECIALLY because they already have to turn/smooth the front rotors and replace the pads. (It's at the dealer as I write this.) No charge, under warranty, but still, this should not of happened yet. The interior is cheap. I have SO many little scratches, marks and a big 'dip' where my elbow rests on the smooth part where the window meets the plastic. I take really great care of my cars and have never seen so many interior marks. I'm a solo driver 97% of the time so this is just weird. Acceleration is acceptable but never fun, even in sport mode.

2634, on 11/06/16 07:17 AM (PST),Steve ,2016 Toyota RAV4  LE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Nice little sport ute to save the day," So a little background on why I purchased a new Rav4. I had a 2007 Rav4 Limited that I had purchased earlier in the year hoping I could reduce my debt and get a reliable car. My girlfriend and I decided that the new puppy needed to make a trip to Little Rock Arkansas which is about 400 miles away from us. I knew that this vehicle had started to consume about half a quart of oil every 2000 miles or so which is acceptable by Toyota standards by the way. Understanding that this vehicle was almost 10 years and had 100,000 miles it wasn't a big deal to me. So what I have to add a little oil every once in awhile. I had never taken this vehicle on a trip before and checked the oil before I left making sure everything was good to go. After completing the journey I checked the oil the next day and found the dipstick to be completely dry. I had pumped over 1000 bucks in this car in the prior month and now it needs a motor great. I'm a huge Toyota fan so I promptly went to the nearest Toyota dealer and started looking for something reliable that would get me and the girlfriend home without any trouble on Easter Sunday, I had been looking at a newer Rav4 anyways just to look and decided that's what I needed to get. I found the one and I wanted and after spending half a day of my vacation buying a car I went to dinner with my family. I was very impressed with how quiet it was compared to the previous generation and loved the standard infotainment system the car had. Being an LE I liked the fact that it had bluetooth and a back up camera standard. The next day we started our trip back home and I found myself speeding most of the way home because of how quiet it was. The sensation of speed is completely different. Going through the Boston mountains I began to notice how much the 6 speed transmissions shift and became very annoyed with it. After owning this car for almost a year and almost 13,000 miles on it, it still annoys me how much it shifts. Without that transmission though it probably wouldn't get the gas mileage it does. After a few thousands miles on the odometer I'm pleased to report that I can get over 30mpg consistently. I think the worst gas mileage Ive seen is 28. After a year the car still remains quiet and I've had no problems. I like the service intervals to. 10,000 miles for an oil change on synthetic oil isn't a bad deal. The one thing that I had to change is the headlights. This car is the projector headlight lenses and I found it very hard to see to the right or left of the vehicle at night. It made it hard to determine how close I was to the ditches when driving at night. I could see that being a problem and somebody taking a turn and clipping a curb or driving right into a deep ditch. I turned to Amazon and purchased a set of LED headlights. I notice the new corollas have them so it was pretty easy to get my hands on set for 100 bucks. They made all of the difference in the world. The other thing that disappoints me is the how much these things are new. I believe my sticker showed almost 27,000. A few years ago you could buy a 4WD XLE with a sunroof for about 25k. I guess that's inflation for you. Great car, love the size, love the gas mileage.",5

There seems to be water intrusion when washing vehicle. Acceleration is poor on highway and left me add what a gas guzzler.  I expected more quality coming from Toyota,  as I had the Lexus suv. The handling is poor.  The technology is llacking, it doesn't understand my voice control at all. Already bringing it in to get fixed.  If the alignment isn't off then the car absolutely handles horribly on the roads and highways.  I put my hand down to pick up a candy and pulled out a plastic cover.",3

2638, on 10/08/16 07:02 AM (PDT),VJ ,2016 Toyota RAV4  LE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Never again," This is my 4th RAV 4 and Loved them so much until the 2016 model drastically let me down along with Toyota Motor Corporation.  I was in joy as I left the dealer lot with my shiny new RAV and loved everything about it , driving it around for a week or so and the clock around 500 miles I noticed this horrible ear piercing whine coming from the Transmission ? I immediately took her back to the dealer and gave them all the specifics of what I was hearing and concerned a catastrophic failure was to come ! They had the vehicle all day test driving and confirming the whine was present at all the specific areas I pointed out - a high pitch whine right before shifting to 2nd and 3rd as well as a horrible drone type whine between 40 and 50 mph and again on deceleration from 65 to 60 mph ??? They also confirmed it on another new 2017 on their lot that they took for a test drive ? I was happy the dealership took the time to look into this and confirmed this horrible noise but as of now it is an open case with Toyota Motor Corp. and doesn't seem to be going anywhere as they pretty much are telling me to live with it. I own this vehicle less than a month and hate it with a passion as I feel like I'm driving a city bus whining my way down the road ! I am disgusted with Toyota's QC and how I read of so many others with the same issue.......my 2013 and 2015 have the same engine and tranny and are so smooth and quiet, so how can they say this can be normal ? This will be my last Toyota if I can get rid of it without taking too much of a beating. Also keep in mind a tranny replacement for this vehicle requires the entire engine to be dropped out from the bottom which also means tearing apart the entire front suspension system.  So think twice if thinking of purchasing a 2016 or 2017 RAV4 and take it for a long long test drive before handing over a dime.",2

The ride is smooth, sometimes a bit noisy from the road, but handles great, for my day to day driving, the pick up is fine, we didn't buy it to be a racer. the entertainment well, was disappointing to find out, with the higher priced JBL system, it didn't come with a CD player, first car since the 80's that didn't have one, but, the Nav is great, the sound is good and easy to control. The room for the back passengers is great, plenty of leg and head room, the cargo area is great, especially when you fold the seats down. All in all, a great ride for the money, and I have no regrets, except maybe for the dealership I went to, but, that's for another review.",5
2642, on 09/20/16 05:24 AM (PDT),yep ,2016 Toyota RAV4  XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Great vehicle Toyota Drops the ball with options," ""Let me begin with I am a Loyal Toyota Customer. More than 7 new and 4 pre-owned in the past 25 years. The 2016 Rav4 is great looking and drives great. Compared to all the Camry's I have owned we really like the Rav better. However, Do not purchase the Navigation System. The Maps are from Garmin and they are at least 3 - 8 years old. It told me there was no Freeway and to take exits just to tell me to get back on the freeway(there was a Freeway that had been there for a number of years). It got us lost. So save your money and use your phone. Also, the eTune system. In Theory it is great. In reality not so much. When it works we love it you just get in and touch the Pandora and away you go. Then it will tell you theres no connection but the pandora is still playing. Then it may just stop all together. Then you get back in the car and it will tell you that there is no connection. No matter what you do you can't get it back. So, you might as well save money and just take the standard system because you can Blue Tooth it and connect for phone for maps and you get a CD Player. Other than that I love the vehicle but when I contacted Toyota to express my opinions they just said we'll pass that on. So, my mistake was I did not take the time to look at the Honda, Mazda and Nissan.I want to update as of march 2017. One of my biggest disappointments is the gas mileage. They rate it at 22 city 29 highway. We have 6600 miles on it and the city driving we can get 23-24 mpg. On the highway if you stay below 75 you can expect around 27 is my experience. If you are cruising 80 on the interstate and no inclines you can expect around 23-25. Any inclines or wind and it will drop like a rock. My experience is 20-22 mpg.Here I am on September 26, 2017. Still Love the vehicle as its style and drive. I have gotten over the gas mileage still on the Highway with any headwind or inclines don't expect anything in the mid or upper 20's. Typically, I am still getting 20 - 25 on the highway running around 80 mph. We now have 10400 miles on the Rav and we still love it. Yes, I still have issues with it stalling turning from an intersection and the navigation system still stinks. It gives you 3 options to choose from Quickest, Shortest and Alternative. However, you would have zoom down and try to scroll through the entire route to see which is best. For example, I was not sure were this park was across the city. So, I decided lets see where the Navi system takes us. Well, none of the routes kept us on the highway the entire time. They all wanted to send us off some side roads and then back to the highway. When I arrived it did not tell that I had and when we left the park and started driving it came back on and told me that our destination was on the right but it was on the left and we were now a 1/2 mile away from the park. Trust your phone NOT Toyota's System (what a waste).Update March 2018. Everything above is still the same but the issues with the hesitation when accelerating and turning from an intersection from a stop. I also have nissan 370Z and I found it started doing the same thing. I realized the the Z was not getting enough air into the motor and the transmission had shifted into too high of a gear for the car to respond to the need. So, I changed the Air Filters to K&N filters ( I have used these on a Mazda Miata and they increase throttle response tremendously. So, that took care of my Z and I thought about the RAV and realized it is throttle response. I changed the factory air filter to K&N and no issues so far. Give it a try if you are experiencing the same hesitation issues. Toyota has no clue and won't help you will have to figure it out. But that seems to have fixed it.",5

I love the styling, the performance and the overall comfort. The rear seats recline which is nice for my grandsons when we are returning from skiing.  Sport mode is quicker, but I have found the performance in Eco mode more than adequate. I am averaging about 26mpg and I use the gas pedal freely. The entertainment/navigation has a fairly sharp learning curve, but the dealership employs a guy to come to your house and show you exactly how to use it and once you learn to operate the navigation it works great! If you want a sportier SUV then maybe this is not for you, but I will trade a little sportiness for a quiet, comfortable ride all day long.

2654, on 08/03/16 12:46 PM (PDT),Leo J.  T. ,2016 Toyota RAV4  Limited 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Good long trip SUV," The Rav4 limited is a rare compact in that it is comfortable for long drives, both front and rear.   Braking is about average as is the shift of the transmission. Road noise is average and some holes in the road were felt with the 18 inch tires.  Emergency handling is great as I unfortunately had the experience of finding out.  A truck pulled out in front of me, I was at about 55mph and the swerve I took to avoid the crash was quite radical and the Rav 4 held the road and felt as if it was in control.  The EPA estimates of 23 city and 30 highway were lower than actual mileage. I regularly get 26 mpg city and easily 38 mpg highway. It should be noted that I drive gently with a light foot on the pedal.    The technology takes some time to master especially the navigation system, it is confusing at times, too many options, and when vehicle is in motion many options are grayed out and are unusable not only in navigation but other apps as well.  My wife could not enter a point of interest in navigation where we wanted to stop on the way without pulling over to a complete stop. Toyota dropped the ball on this system and I would recommend not wasting your money and buying an aftermarket hand held unit such as a Garmin instead.  The load floor at the rear is low making it easy to load heavy items and the cargo area is huge for a compact.  If not for the navigation and some road noise, I would have given this vehicle a full 5 stars.  The price I paid was $29,716 plus a $995 dealer fee.Try negotiating the dealer fee and even eliminating it at some dealerships. I used true car.com and offered the lowest price possible. I have now owned this vehicle for 15 months and have noticed one other issue. The automatic headlight on feature works well after dark but when the light is low such as dusk or heavy rain the lights must be turned on manually. Apparently the light sensor on the dash is not sensitive enough to low light.",4

Three years running and NOT a single problem!! I think it's a great price for what you are getting. I personally don't like the 18 inch tires on my limited but there was no option for 17 at the time which works better for me in Montana on the snow and dirt roads. Much better ride. Not as much clearance as I would like but that 4 runner spoiled me..:) Other than that, I have been very happy with the great cargo space and the sound system rocks!!",5
2656, on 08/01/16 15:58 PM (PDT),Chuck DeLaney ,2016 Toyota RAV4  Limited 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Beats Honda Crv," Had been driving large crossovers for many years.  Kids and grandkids grown or moved away.  Knew that Toyota and Honda both have great reliability ratings, so drove both.  For my wife and I, Toyota beat Honda in most all categories, except possibly gas mileage.  Honda seats very uncomfortable, lots of wind noise and a very rough ride. Settled on Toyota  Rav4 over Honda CRV.  Little worried about new softex  seating material in Toyota, did some research and everything was positive.  Found that Mercedes us almost same (Different named) material in their cars. So far, everything is going great, my wife has more high tech equipment on this car than in her much higher dollar crossover. Haven't had the car long enough yet to comment on mileage, etc.  Will update after 6 mos. Seriously doubt if there will be anything negative to report.",5

I love the way it looks and I don't get to a light and see 3 others sitting there with me.  It is quiet and comfortable to drive.  I have only owned it 7 months and this is what I have found.  The tech guys that did the instruments over did the MPG and MPH choices, there are 3. It tells you miles till empty and I am doubting the accuracy of that since I can only get a little over 12 gallons in when it says it is empty.  They could have had a electronic read out of current MPH.  I have the SE and that trim level does not have a compass built in or automatic head lights.  My old 2009 Escape had both.  I kind of expect that at that trim level I shouldn't have to pay $2500 to move to a Limited to get it.  I am not an aggressive driver and am getting 26-27 (summer), 22-24 (winter) MPG in the city 30-31 (summer), 27-29 (winter) MPG on the highway doing in the low 70's which is great.",4

2659, on 07/25/16 09:13 AM (PDT),Emily ,2016 Toyota RAV4  XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),AWD Rav4 XLE - An awesome vehicle!," I've had my Rav4 about 3 months and am about to hit 5000 miles. For the most part I love everything about this SUV. I shopped around quite a bit until I found the perfect one for me and it was the Rav4. I love its road handling. It's breaking in particular is great. Acceleration is pretty good, not the best ever but I didn't buy a sports car. It is more than adequate and you can use the Sport mode for a little more oomph if you wish. Gas mileage is about what was advertised. I'm getting probably 25 combined on average. Not the best, but about as I expected. If you want better gas mileage there is the hybrid option. The space in this vehicle is great! I had a large male friend (over 6 feet, and a bulkier individual as well) sit in the back, and he immediately remarked on how nice the vehicle was and had zero complaints about room. Cargo is a class leader for compact SUVs. The touchscreen is excellent. I've heard some of them are glitchy or confusing in other vehicles. The tech interface is straightforward in the Rav and I barely have to hit something more than once with my finger to get the screen to react. The built-in Nav is much better than I expected. I've used it several times and it works great for the most part. It has not directed me wrong thus far. I also like how when you input a destination, it will show up with multiple route options where you can pick the one you want. I did let the Sirius XM expire. If you drove by trees it would lose signal. Bluetooth is also pretty good. I've taken phone calls easily and there are no major issues with hearing someone or them hearing me. Lastly I love the design and look of this SUV. I really like the exterior, but I love the interior. It definitely had stand out interior compared to all the other vehicles I tested. Overall I don't have much if anything to complain about. I still love my Rav after 3 months and am happy with my decision. You should put it onto your list if in the compact SUV market as it has a lot to offer.",5
2660, on 07/21/16 16:27 PM (PDT),Jason in Nebraska ,2016 Toyota RAV4  XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Good SUV but missing A LOT of refinements," Overall, the RAV4 XLE is a good vehicle but far from great.  I have many good things to say about it, especially the comfort of the seats.  It's easy to find the good things about it, so I'll focus on all the little annoying things I find with it.  I'll start with the Entune system.  The software that supports it is poor at best.  It's full of little bugs that make Entune incredibly annoying to use.  While in USB mode, I can set it to randomly play songs from the entire flash drive.  It'll go from playing REO to playing Metallica next.  But when I turn the car off, Entune forgets that I want to randomly play the entire drive.  Instead, it only plays songs from the artist being played when I got out of the car.  So every time I get in the car, I have to tell it to play the entire flash drive again.  When using satellite, I've yet to figure out how reliably scroll through all stations.  It seems that after I select a station and then keep scrolling, it stays within the genre.  I have to tell it again that I want to see all stations.  I could go on, but I think you get the point.  The instruments leave a bit to be desired as well.  There is no digital display for the speed.  Not a big thing, but something I was used to with my last car.  There's also no display to tell me what the current tire pressure is in each tire.  I'm told a warning light will appear if one tire is low, but it won't tell me which tire.  If there's already a monitoring system for tire pressure in place, it shouldn't be too hard to give the driver just a little more information.  I noticed that my speed readout is also off about 3-4% or so.  I took it in to the dealer and said that on the interstate, it's consistently showing me going 2-3 MPH faster than I actually am going.  I checked with 2 different GPS units as well as using a stopwatch between known fixed points and manually calculating the speed.  The dealer told me that 2-3 MPH off is normal and is within tolerances.  I pointed out that that if the speed is off, the odometer is probably also off.  The dealer told me the it's also off but within tolerances.  Of the 4 other cars (Chevy, Dodge, Mercury and Subaru) I've driven within the last year, the Toyota is the only one which has a speedometer that's not dead on accurate.  So that means, it's shorting you roughly 1000 miles on warranty.  I find the placement of the daytime running lights (DLR) switch odd.  It's with the headlights.  In order, the light settings are: off, DLR, parking, headlights.  When I turn the headlights off at night, I naturally just move the switch down till it stops.  Well, that means I just left DLR off too.  It should be DLR, off, parking, headlights.  What would be even nicer is automatic lights, but that doesn't come with XLE.  I also noticed that for being a brand new car, it doesn't bead up water like it should.  I used to have a job where I drove a different new car every day.  This is the first new car I've driven that the water doesn't just slide right off the windshield when it is raining out as I drive down the highway.  The water on the hood also doesn't bead up.   The A/C also needs a little help.  For whatever reason, the RAV4 doesn't remember that I like to have fresh air coming into the car all the time.  Every time I start the car with the A/C on, it's set to recycle the air.  Like the USB on Entune, I have change that each time I start the car.  It also doesn't seem to cool as fast as other cars I drive or have recently driven.  That may be more of a subjective thing though.",3

Don't get me wrong the bird's eye view is great, the blind spot sensors are great, the car is awkwardly high and low at the same time, but what bothers me the most is that I can never get the Pandora or Iheart radio to work. And the apps for Toyota are really horrible.

I find the steering wheel to be awkwardly small. I traded in a 2004 Toyota Solara with 210,000 miles. The RAV4  does not even come close to matching that car in comfort or handling.

2666, on 07/07/16 08:11 AM (PDT),Richard Bruce ,2016 Toyota RAV4  LE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),New RAV4," Consumer's Reports gives this car a ""Recommended"" and I totally agree.  Although it is not on par with a $50k luxury SUV, it is a good, solid, comfortable car.  For the money, I think you would have a hard time finding anything comparable.  I've only put 500 miles on the car since I bought it, but it seems to handle very well, and has plenty of pep for freeway driving and passing.  If the long-term reliability meets Toyota's legendary standard, then it will be one heck of a great buy.500",5

It was a 2016 RAV4, FWD, XLE.  I own an XLE hybrid version, so I knew it would be comfortable as I love my owned one.  Well, what was supposed to be a 13 hour drive, turned into an 18 hour drive.  All in one day, leaving the airport rental lot at 5am, arriving at Philly airport at 11pm.  We stopped by our house to drop off our bags before going to the airport, adding 1 hour.  But, the point of the story is that after 18 hours on the road with this car, I will tell you I have never been more comfortable on a long car ride - and this was the longest I've been on in a one day trip.  Yes, the paint on the hood does chip easily, my rental had lots of them from lots of highway miles.  On my own car, I added a bug/stone deflector, and it helps.  But the hybrid is made in Japan, and the paint is a higher quality.  I know, I had the 2015 LIMITED that I traded in on the XLE hybrid.  The 2015 had lots of chips on the hood and around the door frames.  The 2016 hybrid does not.  So, a great car, love it alot, and if the paint chips bother you, get the hybrid while they are still made in Japan.  Nothing bad to say about my rental, and would highly recommend for anyone who wants a great SUV/CUV without any drama/problems/etc.  The paint thing was frustrating, but the bug deflector seemed to help alot.",4
2668, on 07/03/16 17:49 PM (PDT),Frank Skelly ,2016 Toyota RAV4  Limited 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Worst 2015 Vehicle," My 2015 RAV4 is the 20th new car I have purchased and the worst one by far.  The navigation screen is slanted so that for many hours in the morning, afternoon, and evening, it reflects sunlight directly into the driver's eyes blinding them.  The center console arm rest moves forward when you brake and moves backward when you accelerate - I took it back to the dealer and they said it is working correctly - but I have never seen one move as freely as this one and I have probably driven over 100 autos with moveable console armrests.  Also the armrest was leaking white grease down into the storage are below it and the dealer did nothing about it.  I believe it was built with one or more of the stops that are supposed to be in the armrest to keep it from moving freely were left out during manufacture but the dealer - Fort Worth Toyota took no action to try to discover why it moves so freely.  Also the speedometer reads about 4  mph high and when I took it back to Fort Worth Toyota, they overlaid a photo of a GPS speed over a laptop computer video of the speedometer and said it was accurate at 70 mph, but that is a bold faced lie.  I have since talked to a number of other owners of RAV4s and they also have the inaccurate speedometers going all the way back to the 2008 RAV4.  If the speedometer is reading high, it is probably also recording mileage driven as 4 miles high which probably helps them advertise that their vehicles get better gas mileage than the really do.  The US justice department should look into this as this is another example of what Volkswagen did with their diesel engines.  The width of the windshield supports on each side of the car and the way they are angled create very large blind spots making it hard to see coming vehicles when you are turning either right or left.  The clock is angled up and is partially shielded from view by the navigation screen and is really small so it can't be seen most of the time.  Also the display in the instrument panel where they show the temperature is extremely small and almost unusuable.  To make a long story short, I will never buy another Toyota as this is the worst vehicle I have ever owned and I would encourage others to not buy Toyotas either as their maintenance department is terrible and will not attempt to try to fix problems with their cars.",1

Rose ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),The best zoom zoom car out there," I bought my 2016 Mazda Grand Touring in August 2015 after owning a 2014 Touring model which I liked but the ride is better on the Grand Touring, it is quieter, and I wanted leather seats.  I only have about 5700 miles on my car and have not needed any repairs.  I have the dealer change the oil every 6 months and rotate the tires, then I'm off again until the next oil change.  My husband and I have decided to become a one-car family and will look into trading his Lincoln MKX and my Mazda for a mid-size SUV.  That is the only reason I would consider giving up my Mazda.  I am not into sophisticated electronics so I cannot comment on them.  I do rely on the blind spot monitors and back-up camera safety features and will insist on these features when we make another car purchase.  Having lived on both coasts of Florida I have used three different Mazda dealers and liked all of them.  I would highly recommend the Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring.

Also, the Skyactive drive is fantastic in weather conditions. Stopped, in snow, on a slope, the CX-5 has a lot better startup traction than the Subaru models tested side by side. The car corners extremely well, when turning, the head lights actually move towards your turn direction. The lane warning works well as does the active cruise control. You set the distance you want to trail a vehicle and it maintains it. Overall, I am very pleased with this vehicle and would purchase another the next time.",5
2686, on 01/10/18 08:54 AM (PST),Jeff Strider ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Touring 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),At least it looks good on the outside?," I always liked the look of this car going down the road and since I've always had good luck with Mazdas mechanically speaking I was super excited to get behind the wheel of a CX series SUV.  Going into the car shopping trip I thought for sure this would be the next car for me so I booked 4 test drives of only CX-5's at different dealerships in the area.  But after only a few test drives and getting a feel for what it was like on the inside where I'd be spending all my time, I found nothing that really impressed me.  Everything seemed 'just ok'.  The seats weren't uncomfortable, but they weren't really all that comfortable either.  It did have a little bit of sporty ""get-up-and-go"", but there was a lot of annoying road noise that came along with it.  One positive that did stand out as a big plus (which I think goes tremendously underrated) was that the controls were simple to use and intuitive in their location.  Cheers for buttons and switches being where you expect them to be and it doesn't take a training class or an engineering degree to figure out how to use them.  But that being said, the interior is tremendously uninspiring.  The best way I can describe it is that it felt like wearing an off-the-rack suit when you already know what it feels like to spend the couple extra bucks for something custom tailored.   It just didn't have the sauce.  As a long time (now former) Mazda guy, I had to pass on this one.",3
2687, on 12/24/17 12:11 PM (PST),DDCJ ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Touring 4dr SUV w/Prod. End 01/16 (2.5L 4cyl 6A),"Just keep looking, would not recommend, depreciati"," Moving from the Mazda Tribute to the CX-5 was a huge mistake! In a year's time the car depreciated over 50%. After having the car one year there were weird issues occurring such as the plastic buttons wrinkling, the dealership said it was the paint but it was as if they covered the buttons with contact paper because it was not paint. Keep in mind to replace this part took 3 weeks in a entire new control panel had to be put in. The windshield cracked within two and a half months of me owning the vehicle. It was caused from a rock going about 5 miles per hour in a huge rain storm. After researching this recently, I saw this is a very common issue with the 2016 Mazda CX-5 when reviewing the consumer officially reported complaints. Although not the case with my vehicle, it was stated that windshields have been cracking overnight due to frame issues. Please feel free to review this further. The headrest is awkwardly forward and is very uncomfortable. I do feel that this helped contribute to a concussion I received in a rear-end accident where I was at a complete stop. This was also reported by 2 different  people  on the Consumer complaint Government website. Please note I have not officially complained and I'm not one of the ones on the complaints for either the windshield or the headrest. The entire front seat components and the frame was bent in the accident as well and it took almost 4 months to get the seat in. The seat itself without the frame in reconstruction underneath cost $1,000. So parts are hard to get and are costly. I had loved my dealership and had use them for 10 years and this was my third new car off of their lot. They were not able to help me restore my car after the accident even though I used their body shop. I did contact the corporate office of Mazda and they were not helpful either but could only recommend taking it to another dealership. I personally did not feel safe in this car after my accident. I do realize I might have sustained more injuries in another vehicle but I do not feel the CX-5 protected me. I did choose to get rid of the vehicle and lose the over $10,000 I put into it and also incurred a $5,000 loss.",1
2688, on 12/15/17 06:12 AM (PST),Simon ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Infotainment is awful," My girlfriend and I have leased the 2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring with everything on it. Very nice. Blue with beige leather interiors. The car looks great, more expensive than it is, almost like an Infinity FX segment. It also handles quite well although the acceleration and torque are questionable considering it has 184 HP (4 Cylinder). The car has good stability and handles well on snow and wet surfaces. The big downer is the technology/infotainment. Let's start from the remote start (supposedly a great tool to have in cold weather). Except it almost NEVER works. You have to attempt several times from close until eventually it works. Very disappointing. The Navigation system: terrible. You're better off with a Garmin GPS from early 2000s. It doesn't recognize addresses and often gets stuck in a zip code not allowing you to find an address in another area or state (forget about using it for long trips across the country.) Finally, the worst: the infotainment. The Pandora almost never works. We pointed it out at the dealer and they said ""sometimes it takes a while to get it to work, you know"". The Bluetooth has a lot of issues too. It often doesn't connect to the phone (only one by the way can be connected) and even if it does, it disconnects at times. Try the voice command to make a phone call GOOD LUCK! You say ""Mom"", it'll respond ""Would you like to call Number 9?"". Finally the USB connection: a disaster. Since new one of the two USB was getting stuck, we pointed it out we are still waiting almost 2 years after purchase to get the part. I created a several folders on my USB with music we like and the stereo only recognizes the songs and authors. Not the folders say ""Queen Best Of"" or ""Rock and Blues"" or ""Country"". So much for spending several thousands more for the Grand Touring. By the way the BOSE speakers are probably the worst ever made by that brand. I had Pioneer speakers in my BMW in the 90s that were far superior in sound quality and power and they cost me 200$ at the time. The 2016 Mazda CX-5 is very attractive, good in gas consumption, and handles well. But the technology, navigation, and infotainment are an F.",3
2689, on 12/11/17 19:41 PM (PST),Defenderman ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Run to the nearest other dealer in the area......," First off, the looks are deceiving.   It's a fantastic looking SUV.  However, once you start using it daily, the looks become a mockery.  I'm going to start with the basics.  Cargo capacity, in real life, bites.  The slope of the roof and the trim pieces that make it look so pretty are just in the way.  It's also deceptively narrow, shallow and short.  It looks like it can manage almost anything when, in reality, I've had to use my friend's '04 Subaru Legacy wagon to haul things that most normal people would have expected this CX-5 to manage easily.  Now for the really bad stuff:  The voice control is total garbage.  It's almost like it has a mind of its own and purposely selects the wrong information.  The navigation doesn't allow you to forecast out of state travel.  I live in Portland, OR and do a good deal of driving in Vancouver, WA (literally a short bridge span away).  If I have a destination in Vancouver, I have to wait until I enter Washington state airspace before the navigation system will locate anything.  I have the BOSE sounds system, and it is AMAZING!  However, there are different volume settings for the music function, the phone function and the navigation function.  You can't just set one and forget it.  So I can be listening to an amazing tune and then have to turn the sound UP to hear the phone conversation.  Now for the REALLY big pain in my behind:  The transmission:  It's just like having a 1963 Ford Falcon with a manual transmission.  Unless you come to a complete stop, that POS 6-speed automatic won't shift down into first gear.  I have pulled away from stop signs rolling at 5 mph or less, and the car will not go lower than 2nd.  If you're in traffic and need to get around someone quickly, you have to stomp your foot on the pedal and make sure that it connects with some little trigger on the floor before it will make any kind of attempt to accelerate. Otherwise, you're stuck in 3rd or 4th gear after 22 miles per hour and taking your life in your hands.  If you're above 1,000 feet you can forget about passing anyone, EVER!  You have to have the presence of mind to select 'Sport' well before you attempt to pass in order to get any kind of grunt and performance.  The road noise isn't well controlled either, which becomes grinding after about an hour or so.  I drove a stripped down KIA as a rental and you could hear a pin drop at 80 mph.  To say I was disappointed was an understatement.  Mine is a 2016.5 Touring with Moon roof and BOSE system.  I paid just over $27k for it (Leased) and I'm turning it in after one year and just over 18k miles.  I'll take the hit, pay the difference and UBER over to Ford where I have a shiny new Escape waiting for me.  A 1.5L turbo 4-cylinder that will smoke that Mazda all day long and a ride that is compliant but capable.  My foolish notion to give Mazda a chance has proven the critics correct.  Many told me to look harder at the Escape.  I wish I'd of listened.  Take heed...buyer beware.",2

2691, on 09/22/17 08:20 AM (PDT),Kate ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Sport 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Nice car," I have had this car since August 2017. I bought it used for a dealer in Tacoma, and  I would never the use the dealer again nor would I recommend them to anyone. Just because of the rudeness and lack of service after the sale.  That being said the car itself is  a pretty decent car.  There are some minor issues; I realize that not everyone would have these same issues, so I am just throwing them out there.   I realize that there is a back up camera and it comes in very handy. That being said the back head rests do block the rear view when backing up.  Also the front windshield has a blind spot on the right side , due to the slant of the exterior body. Once you learn to get around these (and it may be just getting use to a different car) it is fine. The car handles great. (It's a AWD) and I used it in pouring rain with standing puddles and once or twice in sow and ice. It handles great. (I was concerned  having traded in a 4WD; but no need)  The mileage is consistently above 29.7 mpg and it is actually a fun little drive.   The entertainment system sound is decent.  My only complaint right now is that I just returned from a spring break road trip and I had two alarms/light go off or light up my dashboard. Pretty annoying while you are driving.  One to tell me that my oil change is due in another 15 days or 300 miles.  and the other had to do with my tire pressure. (Tires were fine and the only suggestion  in the manual was to take it to a dealership. Like that would have worked 300 miles from home)",5

My wife drove it on freeway but not on rough road prior to buying car........she has a hard time riding/driving car.  Front (cloth) seats could be more comfortable. Don't finance through dealer unless you want them to 'play games' with interest rates.  Take the rebates and get your own financing.  Bought from Bommarito Mazda South, St. Louis.

When I told him I could do better at a local Credit Union, he offered me 2.59% for 63 months with the same bank.  Didn't feel good.

The infotainment center is a major drawback to this vehicle.  The touchscreen shuts down when the car is moving forcing you into voice control for navigation.  Unfortunately, you must give 70 commands to put in an address.  Navigation also lacks real time traffic updates, so no avoiding major slowdowns unless you use another GPS device.  The XM radio is antiquated.  Only shows 14 characters and no album art.  In contrast, my daughters Mini produces large beautiful XM displays.  The sound system is weak.  The volume has to be up half way before you hear anything.   The driver's armrest is poorly designed and uncomfortable.  This high end package also lacks a back gate release and lacks a compass.  The gas pedal must be punched to get any acceleration.  The CX5 has good safety equipment.  Unfortunately, it will be obsolete in two or three years.  The lane departure system is annoting and has been shut off.   I will update again if anything changes.",3
2694, on 07/19/17 21:37 PM (PDT),Steve ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Love the car but...," Owned since 4/16. 25,000 miles. Safety features are great; Especially the blind spot warning indicators. I opted for the GT because it was the only trim with XM radio and leather.Plus I really like the optional LED light package. The ride is smooth and has all the pep I need as I mostly drive highway so, I set the cruse and forget it. Mileage range is 25/30 mpg. The seats are very comfortable and sit up high. I'm 6'2"" and the ride is smooth and comfortable.The only issue is the center console and the cup holder location. To access the console safely,  you'll need to pull off the highway because you have to turn your body around to access the thing!  Bose speakers are OK but, I expected more from Bose. So far, I'm happy with the car but...for the cons...... l typically keep a car for 10 years and the durability of components concerns me.  I completely clean and detail this vehicle every week and have noticed a few things that concern me after only 1.5 yrs. Some of the finish has started ""flaking ""  around the info screen, the handle in the hatch to release rear seats keeps falling out. And while it fits good, some interior plastic parts just feel ""cheap"".  Exterior: The paint must be micro thin. I don't tailgate but the hood has numerous small chips and over reviews have noted the same issue. The exterior black plastic faded very quickly and must be dresses every week to keep the shine.  My wife has a 3 year old vw Jetta and  you can almost feel the difference in the paint thickness. While I believe I'll get good service from this CX-5, the appearance 3 years from now does concern me.",4

On two local trips of 50 or so miles the nav system took me all over the map and turned the trips into a joke.  I still had over 70 miles to go as I entered my garage!  What would happen if I were in the middle of no-where and I needed to find an address or place?  The fuel tank could be larger.  Bright chrome trim on the dash and steering wheel is a very bad idea, blinding reflection from the sun is unsafe.  This is my second Mazda, the first be a pickup purchased new in 1986 (date may be off a couple or so years) and drove it over 175,000 miles without the first problem.  I hope my 2016.5 CX 5 does as good.  VIN number: JM3KE2CY6G0889315",4

I drove it from New York to California in October and it was great.

I performed quite a bit of research and the Mazda always stood out with excellent ratings. I had not even considered the Mazda but decided to take a good look. The value is amazing with all the options, safety features and fully loaded the vehicle was around $34,000. With the same options on a Lexus or Infiniti the cost was over $15,000 more. This vehicle is fun to drive, gets good gas mileage with regular 87 octane fuel, has automatic hi beam head lights that are the best I have had, automatic braking, automatic cruise control and is a great vehicle. I only have around 1,200 miles and a combination of city and highway. My neighbor has the same vehicle and loves it as well. The Mazda dealer also provides free oil changes, inspections and 15 car washes a year, plus a lifetime engine warranty. I am very pleased with Mazda.",5
2700, on 04/14/17 08:29 AM (PDT),Mark B ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Dealership woes," I love the car, I bought a loaded 2016.5 Grand touring, primarily for the safety features. I was concerned when I bought it that it didn't have all the features promised. The I sense city braking was no where to be seen, until I needed it. I was entering my garage with the door going up, I sneaked my nose in, and the car screeched to a halt, it sensed the door wasn't all the way up. So now I know it works. The infotainment system is good, a little tricky to learn. The navigation is all but useless, I use waze on my phone, and to be fair I doubt any cars navigation could match up. One complaint is the clock, you would think that when you have the screen on clock only, there would be a picture of an analogue clock takin up the whole screen and not a little digital clock in the top corner. I purchased the vehicle at CJ Wilson in orland park, I specifically said I did not want the window etching for the vin. I was given it and charged for it, I take some responsibility for not checking the paperwork, (I was in a rush) but when I addressed it with them they blamed me completely. There has been no follow up from them regarding my whole experience, this has put a damper on my whole Mazda experience. But lesson learned I will go to a different dealer for service etc. Spending that kind of money should warrant better service, shame on you!!",4

And...I'm so glad that I bought it. It's dependable, fun to drive, handles well in bad weather and is pleasing to the eyes. The only ""negative"" that I can say it that the MPG was advertised as getting between 27-32 MPG on the highway and we're getting about 24. Not bad though. Otherwise, a GREAT car.

Really the feature is rather useless.  The car will not stop before a collision occurs.   2) The navigation system is useless.  The car does not offer real time traffic updates. Mazda needs to update their vehicles to use Apple Play.  That would allow the driver to use Waze or Google maps as navigation systems.  Entering a destination is cumbersome and time consuming.      3) The speed sensing cruise control is great.  It does slow the car down in traffic.  Unfortunately, it shuts off at 15MPH so cannot be used in stop and go traffic.  4) The headlights are great as they turn the corner with you.  Brights can be programmed to come on automatically.  5) The Infotainment system is bad.  My pet peeve is that the screen for Sirius does not display the full name of the song nor does it show the album artwork.",4
2705, on 03/15/17 06:36 AM (PDT),BAM! ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Touring 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Great SUV!," My wife had a 2013 KIA Sportage, which I hated from the get go. We had to replace the fuel filter and things just got worse from there. Having it in the mechanics shop, we had a 2017 Jeep Cherokee Limited as a rental for a weekend. We then starting thinking about upgrading and purchasing a new vehicle. The search was on. We thought we loved the Jeep, but after a ton a research, we boiled it down to the Toyota Rav 4, Honda CRV, and the Mazda CX-5. We automatically ruled out the Honda because it didn't do it for us  aesthetically. We test drove the Rav 4 but we found it too noisy, not very comfortable and mundane. Then we drove the Mazda CX-5. Wow! We loved the way it looked, handled and not to mention the great deal and warranty we were offered. We purchased the 2016.5 Touring trim with the tech package (Bose system, moon roof, heated seats) and couldn't be happier. We haven't used the navigation, which was thrown in on the deal, but wouldn't consider it a ""deal-breaker"". The Bose system took a little tweaking, as far as equing, and sounds great. We're musicians so it helps to know a little about equing. We love the moon roof and use it more than we thought we would. Seats are very comfortable, more so than most. We are getting excellent mpg. Interior design is impeccable. We have gotten so many compliments on the looks, inside and out. Storage is perfect and fits our equipment perfectly. That was a deal-breaker for us, of course. The CX-5 is so fun to drive, we look for every little excuse just to take it out for a spin. I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone!",5
2706, on 02/26/17 11:15 AM (PST),MikeS ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Compact SUV with personality," So for background I was looking for a 2-row SUV along the lines of the Ford Edge or Nissan Murano in the 25-30K price range.   But I quickly realized that my price range ruled out a new Edge and Murano.  So that left me shopping in the compact segment for something close to their size and wheelbase.  I narrowed my search to the Santa Fe Sport and Mazda CX-5 which I both test drove. I ruled out the smaller class such as the Tuscon or Sportage out of personal preference. Styling is edgy but not wild. I love the slightly larger wheels and darker rims on the GT and how they fill in the wheel wells with less of a gap than the 17"".   The CX-5 reviews on the web describing the handling and driving experience are spot on and lead the class.  Handling is crisp and car like. The Sport mode keeps the engine in the upper end of the power band and holds the shift points to a higher RPM.  Engine doesn't feel strained when pushed and the transmission rarely hunts for a gear.  I didn't miss a turbo with this engine. Mazda has nailed the driving experience. It is clearly fun to drive and zoom-zoom. Interior: a few nits are the lack of rear air and usb for back seat passengers but hey it's a compact SUV not a limo.  The air gets back there fine.  The other nit is the armrest design for the front passenger.  There is a cut out in the armrest for the driver's right hand to rest on the infotainment controls, leaving no place for the passenger to rest their left arm. Seats are very comfortable and nicely bolstered for lateral support. Thigh support is good front and rear.  Rear seat knee room is a smidge smaller than the Santa Fe Sport but head and shoulder room is fine. I'm 6 feet tall and fit fine front or rear. The Bose sound system is awesome.  I've read reviews complaining about this system but it must be the music they are listening to.  As far as options and amenities, there is a pretty good selection at the Grand Touring level. You can get more tech and safety features with a tech package for around another grand which is on par with other manufacturers. I would like to have seen a few more features as part of the base Grand Touring package such as LED headlights and taillights. No power liftgate or heated steering wheel option as far as I know. Tire and wind noise is slightly more noticeable in the CX-5 compared to the CX-9 I also have.  You need to test drive at highway speed to find out of it bothers you. It is quiet around town. Ride quality is more to the firm side but not jarring over train tracks for example. The CX-5 stands out among the sea of boring SUV's in this class. Check it out! Haven't owned in long enough to assess reliability but I've had a good track record with my other Mazdas.",4
2707, on 02/22/17 16:15 PM (PST),PC ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Sport 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Great Ride!," Took advantage of Mazda's sign and drive deal back in August. Almost at 5K miles. So, far I love this car.  Only the Sport trim was available for the sign and drive deal but, it had all the features I wanted and with the 2016.5 model, all the trims come with the 2.5 L 185 hp engine.  The vehicle drives like a car, a sporty one. Handles great and was pretty comfortable on three two hour one way trips so far. Easy to maneuver and park. Great visibility from the driver position and even the lowest trim gets the rear view camera. Averaging 27.1 mpg with  so far which is decent for a crossover with pretty good acceleration.  I'm able to easily pass other cars going uphill and you toggle into ""sport"" mode for a little extra boost.  Once you get to sixth gear on the open highway, you can easily get more than 35 mpg.  The climate controls are easy to use and it is quick to use and both the heater and AC are fairly powerful.  The bluetooth pairing is cool and if someone tries to text you while you are driving, it will auto reply with a message that you are driving and can't reply.  You can also have the system read aloud the text messages that receive.  No problem playing music with my older iPod nano and it is nice you get two USB ports.    Rear seating is decent and plenty of storage in the rear. The only things I don't like is the lack of cup holders for the rear passengers and you have to buy the rear storage cover for both the Sport and Touring trims. Fortunately, I found one on Amazon that is half the price of getting one from Mazda.  The sport trim doesn't give you all the high tech safety features but, I was fine with that. I was fine with the cloth seats as well.   Overall, I really enjoy driving this vehicle and will probably lease or even buy another one when my current lease is up.",4

Most importantly, it has SERIOUS visibility issues.  The overly wide front corner and between front and back door posts are a  dangerous obstruction to vision.  Not only are they wide enough so that I sometimes can't see pedestrians or bicyclists, but in certain situations they block my view of cars. Less dangerous, but still annoying, are the warning lights that come on  for no good reason (if it's cold, I can pretty much count on the tire pressure and TSC/DSC lights coming on).

This is my wife's car and she chose it over the CR-V and Rav4 because it's not as common. I'm good with that. After 10 months of ownership her complaints are: the ride is a bit harsh and the cargo and rear seating area a half size too small. I barely drive it, but I completely agree with her observations. Additionally, I feel as though the pedals are too close (I wear size 13 shoes), the driver display is not easy to read at a glance (monochrome digital like 1980), and the quality of the materials used for the interior are not as good as the Honda or Toyota. Our son, who is 13 and tall, fits in the car just fine but it's a snug fit when he and his lanky buddies pile in. Good purchase overall, just not my first choice.Update 02Jan2018For the most part nothing has changed. The interior quality is average, at best. We had to have a portion of the driver's side leather seat repaired, the interior fuse panel cover routinely pops off, and the front armrest had to be replaced due to a design flaw.The infotainment display is huge but only displays a portion of the music being played, there's a ton of cheap plastic in the cabin, ride is firm but the engine doesn't live up to that firm ride, and the cabin is too small for us.

It's sharp-looking, both inside and out, and I've been stopped by strangers to ask me about it. It drives AMAZING.  I just recently drove a smaller sporty sedan as a rental, and I couldn't believe that my much-bigger CX-5 drove/handled the same way. I really like the way the entertainment system is set up, all the buttons are in the same area, and are easy to reach.  I can go between music and navigation without taking my eyes off the road, which is important to me because I take a lot of road trips. The navigation is great, there are soooo many different settings and choices of different ways to go. The one thing that's both good and bad about the navigation is that sometimes it takes me super weird routes, like through obscure neighborhoods instead of major roads. But it always gets me there, and sometimes it's faster that way. Plus you can check the route on a map before you set it, and there's different route options if you don't like what you see. The front seats are comfortable pretty comfortable.  I've noticed my back hurts after really long drives, more than it hurt in my old car, but no one else has complained about it in my car, so it might just be me. The ""sport mode"" is great, although I only use it getting on and off highways to save gas. Speaking of gas, the gas milage is awesome for the size of the car.  I average about 25.6 mpg, and that's mostly city driving.  However, I have taken the car a few long highway trips, and then I average 32-33 mpg, and I have heard it can go even higher. I have also taken the CX-5 camping twice now, and it fits my massive amount of camping gear just fine, even without putting the back seats down. It's a bit of a squeeze, but it works! I can't speak for the reliability since I have only had it for 6 months (driven 10,000 miles so far), but I have had no problems. I think the Bose stereo system is fine and sounds great, but I've heard some don't like it, so I guess that's a personal preference. As for the safety, I hit a deer only two months after getting it, I'd say I was going 30 mph, and there were small dents in the hood and a small dent in the front, but that's it. I got out of the car to check the damage thinking it would be much worse. All in all, I would highly recommend this car to anyone.

It has very good handling and acceptable braking, acceleration, and gas mileage. I really like its safety features. The control center (stereo, settings, backup camera, gps, etc) works well, although I am never satisfied with the sound of stock stereos (even when it is the premium version).

Interior was sparse and not as well appointed as some of the competition out there.  There is a plasticy feeling in the car and no real feature comforts.  3.  No rear back up sensors available.  The positive is the price and it does have some punch to it.  Also you cannot beat the gas mileage.  We were blown away however at the Santa Fe by Hyundai.  Never even thought about owning one, but I am super excited about possibly getting one.  The options are many, including turbo 2.0 engine.

My husband bought one last year and our other car, a VW Tiguan, quickly became the less desired car to drive. When we turned in the leased Tiguan and were looking for a new compact SUV, I looked at everything in the class from a new Tiguan to the Toyota RAV4, Honda CRV, Hyundai SantaFe, etc all the way up to a Mercedes GRA and a BMW X3 and the combination of features, handling, design and price made a second CX5 the clear choice for our family once again. Easy to get our toddler in and out of, comfortable front and back, excellent cargo capacity, and a great drive somewhere between the heavy stiffness of a German car and the zippy maneuvering of a Japanese one. Styling beats anything within $15k of the price. Nav system is excellent and stereo system is good. Really happy with my choice.",5

We have always felt in order to feel safe when driving   you have to drive something large and heavy. The down side was always really poor fuel eco. and handling.  I have to say after only having my new cx 5 for 2 weeks the smaller size suv  feels fine.  My family of 4 feels comfortable and safe with all the safety features the cx 5 offers. I find myself grabbing the cx 5 keys instead of my truck keys every time I go out.   It's also a blast to drive ,  its handling is precise and its quick. I was sure you would have to sacrifice fun and performance for fuel economy. Not the case with the cx 5 you get both with the  great fuel eco.. I'm getting 25 mpg in the city which is twice the mpg's of my truck. inside the cx 5 the leather seats are a little firm but comfortable.  Everything inside is laid out nice and is easy to use.

It is a very good road car and I do not feel 'beat' to death after riding for several hours.  I drove from Mississippi to Atlanta, GA all the way and when I arrived at my destination, I did not feel tired or stiff from the trip.  I stopped in Mississippi on the way back and was heading home the next day.  That is when the trouble started.  I tried to resume my trip back home and the transmission 'went south'.

End 01/16 (2.5L 4cyl 6A),2016 CX-5 GT - One Year Later," After exhaustive research, I narrowed the field of small SUVs down to the Forrester, CX-5 & the CRV. My key criteria (and this may vary from yours) was gas mileage, comfort, cargo capacity & price. Performance came in 4th. The Forrester was my leading candidate going into the test drives. Being 6'3"", I couldn't sit in the passenger seat of the Subaru without hitting the headliner. The Honda had an annoying vibration through the steering wheel when stopped. After a year driving the CX-5, I'm extremely pleased with my decision. A recent 500+ mile trip over a 4,000 ft mountain pass, we got 32 MPG. The ""tech"" works well. I'm especially pleased with the adaptive LED headlights, Bluetooth/pandora, lane warning system & the cross-traffic sensing backup system. Then there's the Zoom-Zoom factor. The bodylean for a vehicle of this class/size is fantastic. I have to look very hard to find any Cons and the following is really nit-picking. The supportive seats the make cornering fun become hard and uncomfortable on long road trips creating the ""tired butt"" condition. The great MPG is partially achieved by the transmission getting to the higher gear as soon as possible. This can put you in a weak part of the power curve for the 2.5 engine. Yes, you can put the car in sport mode and manually shift but that will carry a MPG penalty. The visibility is poor with large blind spots. This is especially true for the large front roof pillars. The lane warning system is a must and if it fails, good luck. The speedometer goes up to 160. This puts 80 at the midpoint (12:00). I rarely drive over 140 (kidding). The 5 MPH increments are very small. If the midpoint was 60, the 5 MPH increments would be easier to read. Once in cruise control, a digital readout appears in the instrument cluster. April 2017 update: A recent leg injury has made it more difficult to get into the vehicle due to the high door sill. This is one of those things you don't think of or notice when buying the car. Overall, great car.",5

2737, on 10/05/16 12:58 PM (PDT),Kapsi ,2016 Mazda CX-5  Touring 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Toyota Buyer turned Zoom Zoom convert," Come from a Toyota family - the one's who do not care much about driving and a car is an appliance to them. Test drove the CX-5 / Rogue and Tucson for 2016 models. Wife did the same. We felt the CX-5 was head and shoulders above the other two. Here are some important summary points:                                                          1. Sport mode is very responsive, for a slight pedal pressure it will go, good for merging on highways and good for passing at higher speeds. 2. The suspension is stiff - a toyota mutes even the smallest bumps in road - not this one. And the suspension being stiff is great for handling / cornering. You get more confidence riding this. 3. Skyactive engine suffers mpg hit at higher speeds - This is true for many cars, check what speeds the EPA uses to estimate - if you always go 75mph category you may not get the rated EPA. But still this beats Rav4 / CRV on mpg. Only the Rogue is close but it has a CVT and handles like a Frankenstein. 4. Value for money is great - Mazda is no Toyota, for them to get customers they have to give more features. BSM / RCTA / Power seats at a sub 26,000 MSRP is much better value than Toyota for example. 5. Crash / Safety : Frequent member on CX-5 forums, some of the ones who have been in a car crash had rollovers and were able to get out of the car safely. They are all re-buying CX-5. Solidly built vehicle. We frequently get posts about 2015 users buying 2016 with their insurance money. 6.  This has all the cargo you need, you may have that one occasion a year when you will miss the extra 5 cu.ft. of space in Rav4 or CRV but the daily driving experience will make up for it. 7. Real value is driving this on scenic highways through mountains and curvy roads - Scenic Hgwy 88 in Arkansas or something similar, it will put a smile on your face. This is a good gift for a dad / car driving enthusiast who wants a car - not an appliance which can also carry out the mundane tasks of commuting / kids to school etc.",5

Nathans ,2018 Honda CR-V  EX 4dr SUV AWD (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),A happy lease for an active senior," The CR-V EX, with its Honda Sensing suite of active safety features, is a great lease value:  roomy, comfortable for driver and passengers alike, with ample cargo space for transporting everything from groceries to pets to grandchildren and their gear. The wide-angle and cross-traffic warning features of the Honda Sensing system are an especially welcome addition for drivers who frequent parking lots or need frequently to back out into heavily trafficked streets.  Similarly, the blind spot warning feature is an excellent addition.  Front collision warning and braking proved their worth the second day after I took delivery on the car, when a truck stopped abruptly in front of my at a construction site.  The 2018 info/entertainment system link are intuitive and reliable for simple needs and a joy to visiting granchildren with more ambitious demands.  The speakers are perhaps the weakest element of the entertainment functions, but Bluetooth and Android interfaces are easy.   Controls and settings for the Honda Sensing features are straightforward, and dashboard controls are easy to use.  The glove box seems larger than on previous years' models, and the design of the front center console has been significantly improved.  The EX touch screen is intuitive but continues to tempt the driver momentarily to take eyes off the road -- an obvious danger of all such systems.  Interior finishes may be a weakness over the long term:  Honda has used lighter colored fabrics in door trim and on the center console cover; it remains to be seen whether repeated Scotchgard treatments can provide protection against dirt and stains.  As a lessor, I use relatively inexpensive seatcovers on both front and rear and custom brand-name floor mats in both front and rear seats and the cargo area.   Honda has included as standard on the EX trim the cargo cover which was formerly a pricey add-on.  Driver-side seat adjustments offer ample options, and front driver visibility is excellent.  Rear seat headrests do compromise the driver's rear vision to the degree that it is tempting to pull especially the rear center headrest.  All in all, I'm delighted with my decision to lease the 2018 EX.   Down the road, I wish Honda offered a longer basic warranty; a longer warranty would likely influence my decision about purchasing the vehicle at the end of my three year lease",5

I got rid of it after 2 manual transmission problems this summer, and upgraded to this CR-V. My initial review before 1,000 miles: I really like the powertrain of this car. The CVT feel takes some getting used to but brisk acceleration is there when you need it (but response is slower in ECO mode), and it works really well with the 1.5 turbo engine when driving around town. Most of my miles are highway commuting to work and I'm getting 32-ish miles per gallon so far, which is impressive. I am also really impressed with the active safety systems in the car. They seem to work really well, and I appreciate the lane keep assist system when driving on the highway to work. It reduces stress and hand fatigue guiding the steering wheel. I also really like the interior quality. Fit is excellent and and finish is ok for the price I paid. The hard plastic along the console in the leg well is the only poor touch; you can bang your knee into it easily so I think it should be a softer padded material. The infotainment system isn't really intuitive, but it works well enough. I'll probably be ok when I get used to it, but it's not a high point of the car. That said, I do appreciate having Android Auto so I can use Goggle Maps and navigate that way. I'll update this in a while and throw in some reliability ratings after I've put some miles on. I've been looking at the oil level frequently to check for gas in there, so far none smelled. To clarify, I have an EX-L AWD, and paid EX AWD MSRP. I didn't negotiate really hard - I wanted EX-L but couldn't find one in town where I live slightly used so I went for the new one.",4

When first looking at SUVs we narrowed down the field to the Toyota Rav4, the CRV and the Subaru Forester. Since my husband has recently been diagnosed with Parkinson's and both of us are turning 70, we were looking for features that will benefit us in the future. The CRV was the only one offering the features we wanted such as settings for driver's seat and outside mirrors. It was the only one of the three to offer the mirror setting as well as the seat. It also had the easiest to read digital speedometer. The Rav4 did not even have a digital speedometer available on any of it's models. And don't forget Apple Car Play! Love it. Add in the auto-opening trunk lift, easy to enter height of the car, leather seats, roomy interior, cruise control that almost allows the car to drive itself, ... And now for the cons: gas milage is just ok. We get about 27 mpg in the city. Horrible sounding engine! Sounds like a sick lawn mower.

My thought is this, the 2.4 has been around decades and steadily Hondaized (up dated and improved) and the turbo?  Hmmm.   Plenty of pep, there is only a tenth of a second between the two engines 0-60,   A bit noisy on some road surfaces probably having to do with ""ECO Bridgestone"" tires and they will likely wear in a bit quieter.  First tank was 31 mpg.  Quality is high and fit and finish is obviously excellent.  Lots of space.  I don't miss all the ""add on tecky"" stuff in the (much) higher priced model.  The EX is almost 3K above the LX.  As a genuine old timer I do the speed limit and am conservative and careful and it pays off.  Found that if you have it set on the ECO mode here in Oklahoma you will find the air conditioning might be a bit weak.  Switch off ECO and the cooling improves!  Overall this is a great car and I recommend this model over the higher priced ones with all their gizmos.  Out the door at 25200 an LX with awd.

2770, on 08/22/18 11:04 AM (PDT),Bill ,2018 Honda CR-V  EX-L w/Navigation 4dr SUV AWD (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),CRV Redux," Owned a CRV way back in '99, generally liked it, but boy was it uncomfortable for the long haul.  All these years later I felt I needed another SUV and I'm back in one and I chose it over many competitors both in and out of its class - nothing seemed to compare for overall comfort, fit, finish, value and just plain old attention to detail.  Have owned the car since March and though it doesn't show a lot of miles on the clock we have made a trip to the Outer Banks of NC, a trip to Charleston, SC and a trip to northeast TN from our home in northern VA so you can see it's mostly highway miles.  Through the mountains it gobbles up hills like they weren't there and the CVT transmission is not droney as you would think especially as compared to the Fusion hybrid I traded.  I have left it in ""Econ"" mode for most of the time that I've had it.  Only when I have loaded it up with people have I switched out of Econ, and that is just to give it a little more ummph off the line - and yes the boost in performance it is quite noticeable.  It does tend to be tepid off the line when in Econ.  The seats are great, front and back what else can I say.  I am 5'11"" and 245 with a bad back and knees and I haven't howled one time about lack of comfort when I am driving.  Neither has my wife in the passenger seat and she loves the fact that the front seat backs are also heated by the seat warmers.  The car is very easy to get into and out of and the doors both front and rear swing wide to accommodate entry and exit.  The cargo area is cavernous and the main reason we traded cars.  Came out of a Fusion hybrid and the loss of trunk space was more than we could deal with.  Yes we took a hit on fuel economy, but not that much and the gain in cargo and overall cabin room is well worth the trade off in economy.  The only downside if there is one is that the Infotainment system is fiddly and requires your attention a little too much for my taste.  A car is transportation first and ""Star Trek"" second.  Although voice recognition works fine you have to be on your A game to remember the commands properly and this is no different I don't care what brand you drive.  As far as my ratings go I have left some areas as OK/NA because I haven't truly been able to honestly comment on it, so it may go up or down.  We are preparing for a 6000 mile road trip at the end of August to tour our western states.  I will be sure to update at the end of the trip to see if the honeymoon still holds up.  Cheers.",5

My only complaint is that I really miss the blind side camera out '15 Touring had. That's a small price to pay for a CR-V that has a cabin that feels far more roomy and more upscale than its predecessors. And, they gave us back a volume tuning knob.

Our CRV stayed a very reliable distance regardless of his speed and when he braked hard to avoid an accident, the CRV immediately recognized it and braked us to a smooth but quick stop.

They are clustered on the steering wheel. They are small, labelled with almost microscopic symbols. I'm sure with time I will get used to them and what they do, but for now it is a distraction from driving. Find the button, press it read the display to see what it's doing while you keep your eye on traffic. The ECO really puts some resistance on the gas pedal to make your take-offs more fuel efficient. The turbo is great, you can really feel it kick in. Audio system is good, pairs with everything. We got beige leather and it looks and feels great. AWD, don't know about but had to get it to get the leather. White exterior with black leather or cloth was available but wanted beige interior - had black cloth on my CX-5. Lots of features to keep you in your lane and not tailgating if you want to turn them on. The liftgate is huge and you will need space behind the car when it is opened. It's bad if you try to stop it by hand. My biggest problem with it is guessing were the outside of the car is in relation walls and other objects on the passenger side and the right fender.

The fit and finish inside and out is excellent with no undo road noise. There is a bit of a learning curve to mastering the technology, primarily the advanced safety features.

I test drove both vehicles back to back a few times. Both were great and it was hard to decide. The Accord had a better ride, quieter, and sitting in the back seat was like riding in a limo. The CR-V was easier to get in and out of. (when you are over 70 that's important) With the CR-V loading and unloading golf clubs is easier than taking them out of a trunk.

I expected the Honda to at least be as good as my six Honda bikes I owned over many years. While the dealer after sale claimed that poor performance was news to them, the  number of similar complaints on line would negate this. Salesman pushed the features and not performance. I should have figured that out. The car is grossly under-powered with what amounts to little more than a motorcycle engine at 1.5L and four measly cylinders. Obviously, Honda knew this and added the turbocharger as an after thought, still trying to meet CAFE numbers for MPG. On top of this, my insurance bill doubled, the insurance carrier claiming that it was expensive to repair. How can a Honda CRV be more costly than a Porsche??? Over all, not what I expected even though I have two friends who love their CRV. I feel cheated and discouraged about spending $35K on this car.",3

I commute to work about 120 miles a day. The tires on the back of the car are worn at 23,000 miles. I was told this was acceptable, however I disagree. Also, Honda claims that the car alerts consumers when the tires need to be rotated. However, they fail to say it is not an indicator that comes up on the dashboard (like the oil change light), but a code you have to open the maintenance portion of the information panel of the car. Finally, I have had issues with my iPhone connection in the car, which controls the radio, apps, navigation, etc. Sometimes all apps are present and working. Sometimes they are not. Apps are on your phone and disappear without warning from the screen. Overall, on paper this looks like a great car, but in real life, it is a true disappointment! Do not buy!",2

Please pass along my thanks to your designers and engineers. Love the way it looks (black exterior with black leather interior). Love the way it rides, handles and performs. Love that it is quiet and feels so solid (CVT much quieter than the CVT in the Rogue I rented for two weeks before buying the CRV). Love the safety features, including the adaptive cruise control. (How do you even do that?). Love the back seats (friends sitting in the back can't believe how much room and comfort it offers). Love the gas mileage so far (around town - driving in econ mode - I'm averaging 32 mph. That's so good that I'm not yet prepared to say it's accurate. (I opted for the slightly better gas mileage of FWD after researching AWD on-line and deciding I didn't need it). How is it even possible to design and produce a 190-hp, turbo SUV that weighs 3300 pounds, goes from 0 to 60 in 7.6 seconds, is this comfortable, quiet and roomy, has this much storage space (76 sq. ft. with back seats down so I can fit my bike in back with no problems), and still get such good mileage on regular gasoline? And I love the many little thoughtful things I can do, like program the doors to lock automatically when I exit the vehicle without having to press the key fob (too much trouble :-)) and being able to view turn-by-turn directions on the dash directly in front of me as I drive. This vehicle is just stunningly good at every level.  No wonder it's at or near the top of virtually every reviewer's ""top compact SUV"" list. (Example: U.S. News: #1 (out of 18 vehicles) in Compact SUVs ; #1 (out of 35) in SUVs with Two Rows; #1 (out of 49) in Crossover SUVs). And for those of you who haven't bought a new car for a few years, you're in for a treat, with Apple Carplay (or Google Play) and all of the new safety technology. Leaving my Jetta after nine years and moving into this CRV is like dying and going to heaven. Love the ease of entry and visibility from the higher seating position. No wonder buyers are abandoning sedans and moving into SUVs. Anyway, this one is a marvel and driving places is fun again. It actually has made my life better, sort of like when I got my first computer in the 80's or my first iPhone in June 2007. So... just in case you missed it... I love my CRV! :-)",5

All the reviews are great and no US reviews mention the excess gas in the oil problem - that would be the same problem that had Honda propose to recall over 300,000 CRVs in China only to be told, that's insufficient and have the sale of these turbo engines PROHIBITED! They are working on a fix.  Sales of CRV tubos (and Civic turbos too!) are now allowed back into China but with stern warnings not to sell in cold climate areas.  The problem is when the driver drives for short distances (i.e. just around town, not a work commute) the engine doesn't heat up sufficiently (and consequently you don't get much heat in the cabin either!).  Honda is not changing anything for 2019 because the issue relates to cold (snowy, cold, windy, Buffalo,  Wyoming, or mountainous type climates) - representing a relatively small area of Honda CRV sales (this is not a problem in CA or FL - but beware in the cold!). The local Honda GM would not sell me the car given the location and my expected usage.  The Edmunds reviewer should have known this.",1

It is great to drive in city and highway. The materials that were used on the interior is very good for its price. It is easy to drive, not so hard to maneuver around tight spaces. The cargo space is huge, but it is not meant for hauling big stuff like furnitures (maybe some detachable IKEA products will fit. Dunno, I haven’t tried it yet), The rear seat leg room and head room is surprisingly huge. Fuel economy is a bit on a down side, (maybe because I came from the last generation Civic, and still transitioning from a compact car to a Crossover/ Small SUV) and the CVT is kind of annoying due to it’s rubber band feeling where it feels like, the transmission is holding down the car whenever I am accelerating. Overall, the car’s been treating me nice, I’ve owned  it for a month now, and I am happy with the car because I got all the safety features that the luxury brands offer.",5

", I have had 9 Hondas over my lifetime and this CR-V is by far the best!!! My Accords had the V-6 engines and this 2018 CR-V has the turbo that equals to V-6 in my book except the CR-V has way better gas mileage (avg over 40 mpg on fwy)!!!

It replaced my 2008 CR-V XL-E which was totaled in a wreck. This car is made so well, that even though our 2008 was totaled, no one had any injuries. The 2018 Honda I just bought is even better than the 2008. I love the way it handles and navigation is great. It seems larger inside than the 2008 model.

2813, on 06/21/18 20:26 PM (PDT),Tom ,2018 Honda CR-V  LX 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Noisy Cabin," I bought a brand new 2018 Honda CRV - LX a little over a month ago.  After driving for a couple of weeks subsequent to date of purchase, I noticed a very noisy cabin.  On certain roads, I can't even hold a conversation with my spouse in the vehicle.  The cabin noise started to irritate me so much that I changed the Bridgestone Ecopia tires (came in with the car) to some quiet Michelin tires but noticed minimal cabin noise reduction.  I bought a can of Permatex to coat the front wheel well liners but noticed no difference in noise.  Lastly, I purchased some rubber door insulators and insulated the 2 front doors.  Again, I noticed no noise reduction.  I am very unhappy with the cabin noise.  I can't believe Honda has not caught up with the rest of the other car makers.  This is my first time and my last time purchasing a Honda unless Honda does a better job of insulating their vehicles in the future.",3

I find the wide posts hinder my view to look out on the passenger side of the car............I don't like the small area to view out the rear view window..........the front mirror is also hindering my total view of the front windshield...........I don't feel safe in this car...........it reminds me of a cheap put put.....anyone want to buy my car???",1
2815, on 09/12/18 17:53 PM (PDT),K Thomas ,2018 Toyota RAV4  LE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Reliable but boring!," I am underwhelmed with the vehicle so far.  However, I have not owned many suv's.  I just purchased this vehicle and I thought that it has great safety features for this base model. Pro's are that it handles/drives very well in windy or cross wind days!  You can barely feel that the vehicle is being pushed.  The headlights have auto dim that works pretty well for oncoming traffic. Poor gas mileage for a smaller suv!   The ECO/Normal and sport transmission options are good tho. The bluetooth and sound system is low.  I have adjusted what I could and still callers keep asking me to repeat myself and speak up!! It is annoying and I have checked the in call speaker volume in the settings.  The voice system does not understand names well either and I set up the recognition too!  So i'm fighting with that constantly.  Hands free should work better these days for all manufacturers.  I don't have an accent either.  Stock stereo sounds low even tho I have adjusted that.  Apple car play and XM radio are not an option on this model either sadly.  There always is a hollow wind noise coming from the rear passenger side area.  Maybe its a seal somewhere??!!  Otherwise the cabin would be quiet.....  Plenty of room for the kids in the back.   The cons so far are, The rear liftgate is very heavy to close manually!! Wheel covers on a 23/24K vehicle?! really?!   I bought it for the rebate offered but should have  paid more for the XLE with upgrades.   I appreciate the reliability factor and hope that the trade in value holds up before the factory warranty is up because I plan on trading it in before this....Thanks for reading..",3

I went to the Auto Show when it came to Denver, looked at all the cars, and thought the Rav4 was the best value of any car at the show. It was also more desirable than the CRV, and I'm a Honda guy. I liked the idea of the hybrid, as we do use the car as a daily driver, so the boost in MPG helps. It's a good vehicle to own in Colorado on bad weather days.  There's room to haul stuff.  It's comfortable, very smooth for road trips. We had a Pilot previously, but don't need the third seat any more. We like it. It's meet out needs nicely.",5

A black line appears across the top two thirds of the windshield and visibility from the lower third of the windshield is not more than 75 feet.  This vehicle should be considered a lemon.  It is a death trap for anyone driving on unlit roads.  Shame on Toyota for not issuing an immediate recall.,3
2824, on 08/18/18 21:42 PM (PDT),Kevin ,2018 Toyota RAV4  Adventure 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),"Third Rav-4, love them"," I just recently purchased a 2018 Rav-4 Adventure. This is the third Rav-4 I have owned in a row, 2012 Rav-4 XLE, 2015 Rav-4 XLE, and now the 2018 Rav-4 Adventure. I travel A LOT for my job putting over 40,000 miles a year on each of the Rav-4's. I can truthfully say I have not had one bit of problem with the past two and do not expect any problems with this one. The last two I traded with over 120,000 miles on each and only thing I done to them is the change tires, 2012 at 86,000 miles and the 2015 at 104,000 miles. Not bad for tires that came with the vehicle. I changed brakes at around 86,000 miles on both. I changed wiper blades once on each, and changed oil and filters on schedule. Neither had a tuneup, never even changed a light bulb. That is it, and I mean that is it. Not one warranty issue with any of them. The 2018 has about the same power as the 2015. The 2012 I felt did not have quite as much power but still respectable. No problem cursing 75 mph even through PA and TN mountains. Both the 2015 and 2018 have the 6 speed automatic. I believe the 2012 also had a 6 speed automatic but don't remember for sure.  All three are All Wheel Drive. I read all the reviews good and bad, and even how the placement of the cruise control is a deal breaker for one person. To each their own I guess and not out to judge others. I have also read that the Rav-4 does not handle as good as other  suv's and power is not as good. I can tell you that the Rav-4 corners well and holds the road. It of course is not going to handle like a corvette, then again it is not a $62,000.00 car.  It has a sharp turning radius and can get into some very tight spots easily. It is a fun vehicle to drive. The All Wheel Drive is a must for me and the past two Rav-4's I never got stuck, ever. I have been able to get down the road even when I could not see the road and felt like I was in control. I have pushed snow with the front bumper and heard it sliding across the bottom under me yet it did not spin a wheel and kept going. Yes I got the Adventure this time as it has more ground clearance. I did mention I drive in some nasty winters.  When I purchased my 2015 Rav-4 I decided to never reset the average MPH to see what the average would be. At  122,000 miles the average was 28.4 miles per gallon. I do A Lot of highway driving but I do not baby it. 75 cruising speeds. This is off regular gas. My wife had a 2008 Suzuki. After multiple times in the garage then the starter switch went bad. Then the rear hatch door release did not want to work half the time. She loved the Rav-4 so much she purchased a 2015 Rav-4 LEalso,  so I guess I could say this is my 4th Rav-4 now. No issues with hers either. Every car out there has plus and minus things about them. None are perfect. No one vehicle fits everyone. What one person thinks is poor handling another thinks is great. Everyone has to test it for themselves and make their own opinion. I can say if you are looking for a reliable vehicle that just keeps going down the road with little costs to operate, and holds it's resale value better than almost anything out there, you cannot beat Toyota. My hat go off to them.",5

The quality and caring customer service has always been their strong point. I now own a 2016 Rav 4 XLE and it is a sad example of Toyota quality. The navigation system will get you lost 50% of the time and send you in circles. There is a whistling sound coming from the car when decelerating. The dealer says it is the transmission but the Toyota service rep says they are wrong. You have no recourse to question the service rep. His word is God and Toyota doesn’t care if you and the dealer like it or not. I cannot believe Toyota’s cavalier attitude. This caris junk.,3

I paid 21 781 drive out for an le model. I shopped almost every dealership in Houston and the average price they were quoted me drive out was in the range of 24 to Mid 25. so the price of 21 781 wasn't too bad for full drive out price. I financed with my credit union, shell, and I got $250 back from them by financing it through shell. I hope this help somebody out there who's looking for a car believe me it pays to shop around online and email quotes. I don't know if it helps any but the place I got it from was joe meyers.   not really plugged for them because I've quoted them before in the past and they were higher than everybody else.

2847, on 04/06/18 18:10 PM (PDT),Jenny ,2018 Toyota RAV4  SE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Not what I thought I was purchasing, I was told that the Rav 4 was just as safe comparable to the subuaru and the Rogue.  They were wrong.  A shopping cart with a heavy bag of dog food got away from the customer and headed across the parking lot and I didn’t see it and backed into it damaging a small section of the back bumper.  The car didn’t indicate that there was something headed for the back of the vehicle and it didnt indicate there was a collision.  I was so upset I thought I hit someone with the car!  I was relieved that it was a shopping cart and not a pedestrian.  Every time I look at the bumper I see the damage that could have been a child on a bike that could have died due to the poor/deceptive safety specs of the vehicle.  I think god everyday that it was just a shopping cart.  I no longer trust the safety specs and rely on the mirrors.  I don’t even trust the rear camera or the blind spot indicators.  It’s a cute sporty SUV and it’s very comfortable and can handle well in snow and on curves.  It has poor acceleration performance especially driving up a hill and accelerating onto highways.  There is no brake assist at all not even a little bit.  I also almost hit a tree head on during one of the nor’easters due to the poor visibility.  I diverted hitting the tree that was laying across the road the last second.  That’s when I realized the from indicators aren’t reliable either.  So if you are looking for a sporty vehicle without the safety specs this is the perfect buy.  If you are looking for a safe family SUV with all the safety specs you need to steer away from this and run.  The Rogue and subuaru are the safer bet.,2

2851, on 03/02/18 12:51 PM (PST),LS ,2018 Toyota RAV4  Limited 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),"Great, but some weird quirks"," I have only had the car for 4 days now, so I'm still getting to used to it, but here is what I've noticed so far. Pros: It has more standard features than a Honda HRV EX-L such as the lane departure warning and active lift-gate; Sport Mode makes it feel like you're driving a 6-cylinder engine; it handled great on icy roads; the backup camera picture quality is better than many I have seen so I have confidence using it; there is a lot of information available on the instrument display panel (almost too much) including navigation directions and audio details; the message feature on the Entune Premium sound system gives you 15 different responses that you can change and customize- the HRV only had 5 or 6 and I don't think you could change them. Cons: When driving over some holes or bumps in the road there is a sort of hollow sound coming from the back of the car- I think it's ""normal"" but odd; the all-weather floor mats are garbage- they are soft rubber and do not anchor to the floor, they slide forward 2 inches every time I get in and out of the car- get WeatherTechs instead; some of the button lay-outs are in really odd places- the auto lift-gate button is mostly hidden by the steering wheel and the traction control button is in the middle of dash above the radio- it seems like those two should have been swapped, also the steering wheel controls for the radio are on the left side- it seems more intuitive for them to be closer to the radio; the speedometer is kind of busy and hard to read- I would have really liked a digital speed display added to all the other features of the instrument display; the steering wheel controls are kind of confusing- the controls for the instrument display have more functionality than those for the entertainment system and I'm still getting used to them; some features are highly customize-able such as the color of the radio's font and display elements, while other things I would like to be able to customize aren't there like disabling some of the Entune apps so they don't show up when I scroll through audio sources, also having more apps available through Entune would be nice- the ones they have aren't all that useful to me.",4

Purchased for my son who attends college in upstate New York, lots of snow.... The Rav-4 has a comfortable ride with all the safety features standard. For a compact SUV it has plenty of cargo space and a comfortable rear seat. I am 6'3"" tall and the front seats give me plenty of leg room. My final decision to purchase the Rav-4 boiled down to three things, Great reliability / Toyota's hold their value and the safety features.",5
2854, on 02/13/18 08:40 AM (PST),Exloyaltoyotacustomer ,2018 Toyota RAV4  XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Never wrote a bad review," I purchased a brand new 2014 Toyota Rav4 XLE in March of 2014 at the Woburn, MA Toyota dealership. After trying many different cars, I continued to feel strongly about buying another toyota since I had Toyotas previously. This past week, my stereo/navigation/bluetooth head unit stopped working when I started my car up one day. At first I thought it was reloading or updating, but then it would go dark and repeat the fake reloading cycle over and over. I immediately read up online and tried to fix it. However, my hopes faded more when I saw all of the reviews written about people having this issue with their new Toyotas.  It seemed that not only a lot of people are having this problem, Toyota is not offering any help.Regardless, I made an appt with the same dealer I bought it from in hopes that my experience will be different. Not only did they tell me that they would have to replace the whole unit which would cost about $2-3K, they also attempted to charge me $70 dollars for servicing despite me being very clear up front that I would like to be informed before they did anything that would potentially cost me. The only positive was the very honest and attentive representative I dealt with.To summarize: 4 year old Rav4 that cost about $30,000 that now I ride around in silence, using my Iphone for directions, and needing to take hands off the wheel to make any phone calls. Then, dealership tries to get $70 despite a customer who  appropriately made it clear they wanted to be informed if anything the tech did was going to cost them. An hour and a half waiting for them to just start the car and stare at the dashboard. No need to open the hood or jack the car up.I will never ever buy a Toyota again and have informed my sister of all of these issues since she was planning on leasing a Toyota from that same dealership.I'm a daughter of a carpenter and teacher who worked hard through nursing school and now working even harder as an ER nurse in Boston. I was very proud of my Rav4 and even prouder to have finally paid it off last week. I'm writing this review because there are lots of other hardworking people like me who should not have to pay thousands of dollars for a 4 year old radio. Car maintenance and upkeep is expected, but this, as well as the way I was treated at the dealership, is unacceptable.UPDATE: After about a month and multiple phone calls I received an apology from both Toyota and the dealership as well as a new radio/head unit replaced. Thank you Toyota for making this right. My advice to other people, call Toyota up directly if you want to get anywhere and expect to go back and forth for awhile as well as make it known to the leaders of the dealership. Thank you again.",2

2858, on 01/07/18 14:16 PM (PST),Dragondad ,2018 Toyota RAV4  XLE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Safety Goodies Not so Good," Very disappointed with Toyota. Although the Rav4 has all the new safety alert features, it's audio alert sound is so shy (volume is so low) that you can't even hear the alert. For example, Lane Departure alert sound is so low, you can't hear it.  I don't even have the radio on.  The Camry and Corolla alerts are so loud , you can hear them with no problem. What's wrong with the engineering ? Then the Blind Spot Monitor (BSM) system doesn't have a audio alert. It just blinks/flashes if you're trying to switch lane when a vehicle is next to you. Toyota really needs to learn from my Mazda CX-5 features. The audio sound (loud enough) really alerts you when a vehicle is next to you if you're trying to switch lanes. I bought the Rav4 XLE version (almost $28,000 sticker price), it doesn't come with powers seats or illuminated buttons for windows and door locks. Another disappointment.  Overall, Rav4 does not deserve a 5 star rating, not when Toyota start cutting corners.",4
2859, on 01/02/18 17:50 PM (PST),JCB ,2018 Toyota RAV4  Limited 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),not my best purchase," 1	The rear window, offers limited visibility and is constantly cover=ed with either dust, dirt or snow because of the dumb airfoil operation in the rear.2	The front grille offers poor air flow especially in the winter, the grille clogs up with snow and ice thereby blocking the air flow and causing the engine water temperature to rise unless you manually remove the accumulated snow and ice.3	The front doors have a poor bottom design that accumulates snow and ice that if now removed freezes the door closed or packs mud or dust that seeps into the vehicle interior.4	The swept back design of the front doors is a safety hazard as it sweeps backward and smacks a person in the head because of its design not permitting proper clearance when opening the doors.5	The antiquated technology of a push start/stop button is terrible, a normal key ignition is far superior to this Model T technology.6.	The dash electronics are absurd and useless not to mention very distracting, ever hear of “distractive driving” that describes your electronics.7.	Heat rotary switch are ridiculous, you are in one confined car interior do you really think that one side of the interior is going to be a different temperature, must be a millennium design person to think that is true.8.	Floor mats do not cover the floor except when the seats are fully in the forward position.9	The wheel wells do not provide enough clearance in the snow, ice or mud, use of 17 and 18 inch wheels are the major cause.10	The 17 and 18 inch wheels are absolutely useless, they accumulate snow and ice so fast and hold it that you constantly can feel the vibration in the vehicle, unless ever time you stop driving you remove all four wheels off the care and scape the snow, ice or dirt off the inside of these wheels.11.	Rear suspension is terrible, the angled direction of the shock do not offer proper operation of the shocks and therefore the rear wheel drop with a bang when driving.12	The rear hatch door is impossible, in the cold and and snow the outside switch to operate this door freezes and is then useless, In normal weather the door electric opening and closing is absurd, useless and very slow, better to have a manual opening door opening left to right of right to left over vertically opening door.13	Swashed roof line is useless and absurd not to mention ugly.14	Rood rack useless unless extreme caution is used otherwise the rear hatch open up into what ever is on the roof making the design very poor and thoughtless.15	Mileage, I get better mileage from my 1967 Land Rover 109 than with is electronic ignition, injections etc16	Old saying: do not change things that work, the old er design and technology was better and in this case very much better than your new design and technology",2

2864, on 09/15/18 08:08 AM (PDT),Shakir Rahman ,2018 Mazda CX-5  Touring 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Smooth Car Buying Experience!," My wife and I decided on it's time to buy a SUV, after researching for couple of months on all the brands and going to multiple dealerships we've narrowed our list down to 2018 Mazda CX-5.  Then after talking to several Mazda dealerships all over Houston Area, Russell & Smith Mazda was the best in class.  They offer great incentives at the dealership as far as maintenance is concerned, one of the top dealerships that offers extra value after you buy your vehicle.  I actually talked to a lot of great sales rep at each dealership but something about Russel and Smith made us feel at ease.  On August 28th, 2018, we decided to take the leap and Gilton Huggett was our primary contact and he's been outstanding every step of the way.   Extremely knowledgeable and able to answer all our questions.  This was the smoothest car buying experience we've ever had.  Price was negotiated up front before we even came into the dealership, no hidden fees or hassle once at the dealership, really put us at ease.  I kept waiting for a catch, but there was none.  We were provided excellent customer service from both Gilton Huggett and Jad Jibin from the moment we walked in, we were explained everything and test drove the vehicle we were interested in.  Then how the vehicle works after purchasing it.  The CX-5 is phenomenal, i'm super satisfied with the purchase!  Not only does it look amazing, the plethora of features and drive is unreal.  Gilton answered all our questions and provided phenomenal customer service from the start to end.   Even after buying the vehicle, Gilton was still answering all our questions and giving us tips and tricks.  I love how the excellent customer service doesn't end with you leaving the door.  Finance department was great, no hidden fees and catches.  This was a super smooth car buying experience.  I'm going to recommend Russell & Smith Mazda to all my friends and family.  I'll definitely do business again with them that's for sure.",5

Everytime we bring the car to multiple dealerships, we get the same answer, whether it is under warranty or not, that they cannot find and problems or codes. The dealership doesn't perform any investigation past checking codes or replicating the problem. Mazda policy seems to be set so that if neither of these two conditions are met then the customer must be lying about the problem. Mazda never once questioned the reliability of their diagnostic system to detect electrical problems.",3

I wish the entertain system had more categories for my favorites. I like the system control by the gear shift for music/navigation/vehicle systems/communication.

No b.s from the dealer “Brightbay Mazda” which was excellent due to a good deal gone bad at a Honda dealer “apple honda” the crv was in contention as well.we agreed on the price signed the sales agreement and left the required deposit only to find out upon delivery that the deal had changed wait what?  They forgot to deduct the owed money on the trade as well as wait for it ....... the tax!!  So after three days of fighting several calls to corporate we decided that not only will we not do biz with Apple Honda ever again despite purchasing three cars prior from them we won’t do biz with Honda again either!

2873, on 08/05/18 07:22 AM (PDT),C ,2018 Mazda CX-5  Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Great car well worth the money, I purchased the sport model two weeks ago and I have to say I am immensely pleased! I’ve been looking around for a while for an SUV I started with used couldn’t really find anything that I liked or that didn’t have a ton of miles on it and then I found this new. I got the sport model which is the base model and it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles but compared to the base models of other SUVs it actually is pretty well-equipped and it’s super quiet. The LED headlights are super bright and at first I thought I would regret not having the fog lights but I don’t need them these lights are superbright and you can see super far. I do wish the car had a CD player and that it had a few more speakers but for a base set the speakers are actually really good. The car does have a very quality feel to it so I’m guessing it will hold up well. I also wish the car had the releases in the truck to fold the seats down since I have a base model it doesn’t have them at all. Other than the black trim/seats which is hard to keep clean I have to say overall I give it five stars. I really wanted a sunroof so the dealership had one put in so I didn’t have to step up and spend a few more thousand dollars for the touring trim.,5
2874, on 07/31/18 21:32 PM (PDT),George C. ,2018 Mazda CX-5  Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Luxury feel for midlevel price," Just got this car 2 days ago. Traded in my 2007 Toyota Rav4 Sport. This car is much nicer inside than my other car. Really like the selector knob to navigate the infotainment system. The infotainment screen is touch screen too. The selector knob is something that you usually only see on higher end cars. I like the seats. In my touring model they are suede/ leather. The seat itself is a bit firm. I opted for the preferred package. This got me the upgraded 10 speaker Bose stereo, navigation, and auto dimming mirror. It is worth the $1200 cost to upgrade. The Bose stereo is not as nice as I thought it would be. I think Mazda needed to install an amplifier. The basic radio doesn't have the wattage to really make the stereo thump. Minor flaw, imo. Perhaps something they need to address in future model years. I expected the stereo to really boom with 10 speakers. Another drawback is no more CD player. Most newer cars are ditching them. The ride is a bit firm, but that is what makes the car handle so well when turning/cornering. Acceleration I think is great compared to my old Rav 4. When you step on the pedal this thing gets up and moves. The accelerator is a little funny feeling. It is floor mounted rather than the usual suspended in most cars. Can't speak on gas mileage as I'm still on my first tank of gas. Lol. All in all I think that this is a great mid price SUV with a higher end feel to the inside. I believe that is what Mazda strives for, and they've succeeded. This is a must try car for anyone in the market for a new SUV.",5

In my estimation, it is every bit as smooth riding as my '14 Lexus 350.  And a quiet - if not more so.  The power is more than sufficient for the size of the car.  Have just returned from a trip to the mountains and noticed the engine does ""buzz"" a bit when accelerating up a steep slope.  Got about 33 MPG on the highway, am getting around 23-24 MPG in town. Bought it because of the many safety features which were offered and love all of them.  Wish it had parking assist warnings, but the backup camera is excellent.  I found the seat position very comfortable during a 5 1/2 hour drive and the power passenger seat is nice - something I couldn't find in the other cars I considered.  I do have a complaint about the massive driver's manual that accompanies the vehicle - it is one of the most convoluted things I've ever tried to read!  At least 65% of the manual deals with warnings:  ""Do not lower the rear seat back if someone is seated in the seat as it might cause bodily harm""! Still, very pleased with the purchase and would recommend it without reservation.",5

Previous car was a 2015 Jeep Cherokee and this NEVER happened. Also, I realize I can't check the tire pressure from inside the car? Why? And the tech is just awful. Design and utilization.

I have ridden in a Jeep Patriot as well as a Toyota Rav4.  This vehicle has a much smoother ride than either of those.  It is so quite inside.   I have only had it for 2 weeks and the only ""complaints"" I would have for changes are : (1) The center console is a little further  back for me and needs to be repositioned.   (2) The center front cup holders need to be repositioned - my drinks get in the way of my right arm and (3) it  would be nice If  ""all round camera""  was available.  I have never had this feature, but it seems to be a nice feature to have.  I got a wonderful price on the CX - 5 t and it has the package that really gives some of the features found on the Grand Touring such as the Navigation system, the 10 speaker Bose sound system, moonroof, power rear lift gate .  It would be nice if the Navigation system was in color.  But a feature that my CX - 5 has  that I REALLY do like on  the Navigation system is that it recognizes the speed signs and it changes to  ""red "" if you going over the speed limit.

It seems to have a hard time deciding which gear is should be in. In the normal mode it shifts too early and in Sport mode it shifts too late. So, unless you want to use the manual option, what you get is either sluggish performance or over-the-top racing RPM's. I took the car into the dealership service department and asked about this, but they just said that's the way it is. They even told me I shouldn't use Sport mode unless I really need quick acceleration or I'm driving up a windy hill. Really?!! I keep thinking I'll get used to it, but that doesn't seem to be the case. It bugs me as much now as it did the day I got it. Sure wish I'd checked out Sport mode during the test drive. I think I would have kept looking if I had.",4

I only have the Mazda for a week so I may update this review in the future but so far, I only have one complaint with the vehicle. This model with the Premium package has a ton of safety features but the one it's missing is it doesn't have an all-around camera. This feature was on my Murano and was really helpful when parking as you can see the lines on the sides of you as well as the front and rear of the vehicle. This is also helpful when parking in our garage since I need to back in to my space. On the positive side, the interior seems spacious for the dimensions. My wife drove a 2015 Rogue SL AWD and I got her the same Mazda CX-5 with the exact same equipment since our leases are both up within two weeks of each other in a different color. We both think the CX-5 interior is nicer in every way than the Rogue and all storage other than the glove box and center armrest storage is fine in the CX-5. The paint quality, fit & finish & general build quality are as good or better in every way on the Mazda. All the interior materials seem nicer on the Mazda and the ride quality is definitely better than the Rogue. I think dollar for dollar, the CX-5 will be a great choice if you want a sporty compact SUV with a ton of features for day-to-day driving and very good fuel economy in a fun to drive SUV.",5

I have looked at everything from new to certified used. My price limit was 35,000. I never thought I would ever look at Mazada but once I saw what was included for SAFETY fearures I was shocked. I had to look at what this was. For what was included for the money nothing came close. You can spent over 50K on a compact SUV and still you will not have features that this vechicle has. Compare apples to apples and don't be stuck what other people say or because it's a Honda it must be good.  I traded in a Honda CRV and the new CRV was 5k more than what I got. Remember (Apples for Apples)  The BMW was way out of sight and the Audi did not even come close. I have had this for over two weeks and my wife and I are thrilled. Everytime I get into the vechicle I'm amazed at what new technology that this has. Mazada has stepped up there game to become competitive in this market. It handles like a sport car and the ride compfort is amazing. The new Mazada CX7 is coming and the CX9 is also outstanding.

2895, on 01/16/18 13:14 PM (PST),Dirk Lebowski ,2018 Mazda CX-5  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),A bit disappointing, My CX-5 is an average car.  I can't compare it to other SUV's since I haven't driven them.  But I will not buy this car when the lease is up.  I leased it to test the safety technology knowing that in three years this tech will have advanced significantly.  Pros for safety: great headlights and visibility.  The blind spot monitor works well as does the pacing cruise control.  Cons for safety: the active braking is useless.  It will not stop the car before an accident.  Ditto for the lane sensors.  They are just an annoyance.  They do not work on faded stripes.  The infotainment system is very disappointing.  The navigation does not have real time traffic so is useless for day to day driving.  Stick to Waze or Google maps.  The radio is disappointing.  Sirius does not display the full title of the song nor the album artwork.  The engine is underpowered.  Mazda has a sport mode button as a crutch when accelerating.  But the shift points are crazy high.  At 65 in sport mode you are still in fourth gear.,3

Only one complaint and it is a disappointment to me living in a big city. Navigation does not have real-time traffic and cannot reroute you around accidents. I find myself using Waze everyday. It’s a shame really because navigation is desolated on the HUD nicely but I don’t use it anymore. They really need to upgrade that. Wish they can update the software to fix that. That’s my only gripe on an otherwise great vehicle. Grand touring with premium package. Love love the heads up display and all its functions. It really is awesome. Shockingly quiet on the road. Had owned 3 Mazda’s before. They all had road noise. Not this one.  This one is a quiet as my wife’s RX350 Lexus. Bose audio is not as good as I hoped. My old 2008 CX9 Bose system was wicked. This one is just okay. I wish they did a better job with the high end audio. Rides great. Fuel economy great. Interior is very nice. Really, for the money, it is awesome.",5

We just drove it for over 300 miles and it only took $25 to fill it back up. It drives amazingly and it's so quiet you sometimes can't even tell if the engine is running. One thing I like is that it has anchor holds for a car seat that our previous car did not. I felt so paranoid because the only thing holding down our 2 year olds carseat was a seatbelt. The anchor holds are so much more secure.,5
2899, on 04/03/18 06:18 AM (PDT),Shari ,2017 Hyundai Accent  Value Edition 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 6A),Just what I wanted!," Purchased this car because I drive approximately 60 miles a day and needed something good on gas, comfortable and easy to drive. This little car was perfect. Although it had 5300 miles when purchased, I have added approximately 1400 since March 2018.  The back seat can be a bit cramped if there are really tall people in the front seat.  On the highway, the car has a smooth ride and is able to accelerate quickly when needed.  The gas mileage is running about where I expected it to be, when using Ecoboost, which is around 34-35 MPG for combined highway and inter city driving. Not using the Ecoboost, for greater performance, the mileage still runs about 32-35 MPG.  I have only had the vehicle for a month, but it seems as if it will be a great quality vehicle with acceptable maintenance costs.  Warranty and extended warranty purchased through dealership should cover a majority of any problems that may arise between now and the time the loan is paid off.  If you are in the market for a sporty looking, economical and comfortable small vehicle, consider the Hyundai Accent.",5

I have had absolutely zero buyer's remorse. Previously I was driving a 1995 Nissan Altima, so this car is a huge improvement in every way possible. I live in a rural area and commute to work so I wanted something with good fuel economy, great night time visibility, and something I feel safe driving. The Accent exceeded all of my expectations. I am averaging 40 mpg! I've driven over the mountain pass recently and averaged 41 mpg! The steering is fantastic and I love driving through traffic circles and winding roads. The interior feels huge when you're inside the car and I can haul so much that I'm still shocked by the cargo space! The headlights are amazing, I feel like I have a really clear view of what's happening on and off the road around me. I love the Bluetooth capabilities, I am constantly playing music from my phone and love that I can safely answer phone calls. Even the color and appearance of the car is enjoyable. I opted for red because I wanted a bright color so my car wouldn't blend in with the background of rural driving. The dealership has contacted me multiple times to ask how I'm enjoying the car and I have no complaints. This is by no means a luxury vehicle and I've seen plenty of reviews complaining about the lack of features. This is a very basic vehicle by today's standards but if you've been driving an old rust bucket this car is a dream.",5

The car is very responsive in handling, though if you like a sportier feeling like I do, I'd suggest adding Storm Lowering Springs and a short throw shifter.

This car is maybe one step above a stripped rental car. The quality of the interior is cheaper and less attractive than her 2013, the her 2013, which wasn't a top of the line Accent came with fog lights, auto dimming review mirror with compass, better quality interior and you were actually able to purchase a jack and spare tire for that car. I regret buying this car for her now but to late to get rid of it, it's only one month old and has a horrible resale value. Even the Hyundai dealer I bought it from didn't want to work with us to trade it in on a used Elantra. Poor resale value, absolutely bare minimum extras for a top of the line model, very dated styling, almost as if Hyundai went back to the Excel days of the 80's but without the cheap price. Guess she's stuck with this till she hits the break even point with her financing. Makes me think twice before buying a Hyundai again. In hinesight, the Kia Rio, which is their bottom of the line car is actually a better car. My own fault for not doing more research plus was under pressure as she needed a car quickly for getting to and from work, public transportation where we live is horrible.",2

I prefer one place for one ""output"", not ""multi-use"", and  clairity.  We need a separate ""boxed"" odemeter display, etc.  Also there is a large gear-shift ""suggestion"" that needs to be tamed and put in a corner of the instrument display area, and I'd also like a notification of what gear I'm in, with the shift suggestion appearing as a smaller digit with an up or down arrow.  2. Tire pressure sensors are great, but tell me the actual pressures when I ask.  Also, tell me real coolant temps, not just H/C.  3. An builtin outside temp and compass above the rear-view mirror would be nice.  As would making the rear-view mirror wider.  4. I like having keyed doors and trunk.  5. The radio/clock etc panel similarly needs to be much less ""multi-function"".  Provide a little real-estate for each output (time. radio frequency) and keep it there all the time.

The AC controls have a weird automatic state when temp control is set to max ""blue""  that overrides all the other controls, recirc, etc.  - Maybe give that state a separate notch on the temp control labeled MaxAC.  13.

2912, on 11/28/17 16:09 PM (PST),Slimjim ,2016 Hyundai Accent  SE 4dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 6A),Good Economy car with many little personal gripes," So I have driven this car for about 3.5 months (3000miles) now and I've come to a settled decision about this little economy hatch. I'll preface this review by saying I've owned many other smaller cars throughout the years; a 1996 honda accord, 2007 nissan versa hatch, 1961 ford falcon wagon, 2007 toyota yaris Hatch(current).  I'll start with the negatives and go from there. The car had 7xxx miles when i picked it up, and currently has around 10xxx at the moment. First off, the ride quality is decent, but the noise level is quite abysmal. Conversation is impracticable in this car without speaking up quite a bit. Above 70mph, it feels/sounds like an commercial jet at cruising speed, hitting all sorts of turbulence. The stability of this car at highway speeds is ok at best. The brakes are ok for this size car. Nothing special. The killer for me is the engine. At idle, the engine bobbles around the rpm slightly which feels unsettling to me, as this is a new car. The acceleration off the line is pure garbage and low end is pathetic. Coming from a yaris hatch, the yaris feels like a sprint car around town compared to the accent. I'm in no way a reckless driver, but i like a car with slightly more giddy up off the line. After 2k on the tach, it livens up a little, but the first 2k is a deal killer for me. Gas mileage for me was decent, as advertised. My real question is how in the h#ll does a 1981 200cid inline 6cyl ford engine get the same mixed mpg as a new 4cyl accent??? No joke, the 1961 falcon gets around 28-30 CITY. I push it around town quite quickly too, and the mileage remains the same!! Anyways, I found the eco mode on the accent to be un-usable and barely affected the mpg. I kept it off after 2 days of use. The automatic transmission is a nice little transmission, but the manual shift mode is unresponsive, and frustrating. Once again, I'm not looking for formula 1 style shift times in manual mode, but the thing doesn't even respond as you upshift or downshift in a jiffy. It's like you've gotta wait for the car to think for a moment, and have a cup of tea, before fulfilling your request to downshift/upshift; and consecutive shifts are not possible. No matter of jamming/slamming the shift lever fixes it. My point being, make it work half decent if you plan on putting it in a car. Total fail. The stereo system was standard but the buttons often took multiple clicks before they registered. You were required to firmly push 1 corner to properly activate the button. Ok, enough with the negatives, lets get into the things i disliked a little less about the car. Firstly, the cabin interior and seats are ok, nothing to write home about, just good. I loved the armrest for the driver as it was attached to the seat. As crazy as it sounds, i liked that feature alot and used it all the time. I also loved having a usb connected system which synced up nicely to my smartphone and played all my music through the system. Cruise control worked well, and the ac also worked just fine. Overall, the car satisfies what it was intended to do with a few gripes along the way. I could not own this car in the automatic version, but i question whether the standard version has improved drive-ability around town. I didn't think too much about the issues at first, but in the end, they truly begin to wear on me and drive me nuts. I'll think is stick with my Yaris for now. Cheers",3
2913, on 11/05/17 18:31 PM (PST),Clay streetman ,2016 Hyundai Accent  SE 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 6A),"Reliable,SAFE good looking car"," I bought a 2016 Hyundai Accent with lifetime warranty in may. I was wanting a nice looking reliable car with good gas mileage,escpecially having to drive back and forth from north Mississippi to Texas after moving.After debating between the Accent, chevy Cruze,and versa, the Accent to me was by far the best looking and I loved the test drive in the Accent the best. The interior of the Accent is very nice, seats good and looks quite fancy,inside and out. Equipped with satellite,auxiliary,Bluetooth, radio sounds great with the 6 speakers. There is more than enough room inside, including the cargo area. Very spacious. It has about all the features you could have except for backup camera and automatic seats. Handles beautifully! Love driving it. Handles great in any condition.very reliable.the only downfalls that I have is there is it gets just a bit noisy on rough roads, though it rides very smoothly. Fine finish on doors and dash scratch rather easily, engine noisy when accelerating heavily. Awesome car.safety is VERY great. Ended up in a horrible accident in my first 2016 Accent. Flipped twice and rolled four times. I unbuckled and reached in the backseat, and run off the road in a ditch at 70mph. Keep in mind, I wasn't buckled. All that happened was I fractured some vertebra in my back, still have trouble with it to this day. For it to flip and roll that many times, UNBUCKLED, That is definantly a safe car. When all the airbags deployed, it's like I was in a big bubble. Hated to lose my car(thankful to be alive!) ended up getting another Accent, a silver metallic looking one. My first one was white. If I could give it 6 stars I would. I give safety a 10.",5
2914, on 09/28/17 08:14 AM (PDT),Ray Mack ,2016 Hyundai Accent  SE 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 6M),A good starter car," The Hyundai Accent is a very good entry level auto. The particular car we bought is ""plain vanilla"" but it is reliable transportation for basic everyday commuting. The 60 month/60,000 mile second owner factory warranty makes buying it used a good value. (We ended up with 24,000 miles and 3 years left). The 100,000/10 year new car warranty is definitely a good reason to buy new. You have no worries about repairs (should they ever be necessary) for a very long time.",4
2915, on 02/05/17 14:09 PM (PST),JPady ,2016 Hyundai Accent  SE 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 6A),What a deal.," I got lucky. I needed a car and there just happened to be a lot of leftover 2016 Accent's so I scored an incredible deal. $3,000+ off (including rebate) on an economy car is huge. Plus when the dealer couldn't get a manual transmission for me, he threw in automatic for no charge too.I researched it as much as I could in a week. I considered the Rio, Versa, Fit, and iA, and the Accent won hands down. I was looking for low price, long warranty, and I wanted power doors & windows (the entry Versa & Rio did not have those). The reliability (JD Powers, Consumers Report) was above average for the group, and I think it's the best looking too - very stylish for an econobox. And you can't beat the warranty.The two things I didn't like were: No spare tire and no covered console storage with manual trans. I won't drive without a spare, so that became part of the negotiations (spare tire kit was $400 list). And as a final bonus, the car I got had Option Group 2 which has the console bin. ...And cruise control!So far, I love it. This car is a real pleasure to drive. I've only had it a month, but I like it more now than when I bought it. It's the most competent sub-compact I've ever owned. No, it's not the perfect car. Heck, it's one of the cheapest on the market. But all things considered (price, features, looks, reliability, warranty, performance, economy, etc.), I would give it 6 stars if I could.UPDATE 8-11-18: So far, so good. Still love it (but still wish it was a manual trans :-). The only problem so far was a sensor in the steering wheel needed replacing, which was covered under warranty. Overall MPG is 34.1, and the best I got was 42.5 on road trip. I alternate turning the ECO button on every other tank and the difference has been negligible (less than 1 MPG).",5

Safety concerns you hardly have a hood you can't see the hood of the car in front of you not really a crush zone. But other than that it's great but once again super low front ground clearance don't get mad if you scrape it up a little,4
2917, on 09/13/16 04:21 AM (PDT),Marc Brunetti ,2016 Hyundai Accent  SE 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 6A),Outstanding Value," Purchased 2013 Accent Sedan, and very happy with it. 116,000 miles in three years and not one problem. Drove from Florida to New York with two adults and two teenagers fully loaded and got 42 mpg on highway. Got the mpg on highway up to 51 mpg by coasting down hill.  Just bought another,  2016 model. Stability control and anti lock breaking a plus. Downside: fabric on seats gets stained too easily. Comfort on long rides. No rearview camera.",5

I had a 2012 4 door 4 1/2 years that I loved and the dealership had a special.  I had wanted a hatchback.  Found out after delivery the hatchback is 10"" shorter than the sedan so I really did not get the additional space I was looking for.  Gas mileage is less than the sedan, averaging about 28 unless I am really conscious of how I am driving and coasting (I have a manual stick)  There is a bizarre film that keeps creeping up on the inside of the windshield that is driving me absolutely batty.  I clean it and days later it returns and I can't figure out if the defroster, heat or AC i causing it.  but cleaning the inside of the windshield always leaves greasy streaks.  Very Bizarre.  I had the Simonez coating put in and on the car.  not impressed by that - ended up putting seat covers on it anyway and its the only logical cause I can think of for the film being greasy.  Sluggish acceleration.  Pretty much get what you pay for. I did get the bumper to bumper warranty for  100,000 miles over the 50,000.  I wish I had gotten it on the 2012 instead.  I probably would have held onto the 2012 longer had the warranty not run out.  This has less rearview visibility because of the tiny hatchback window. I had driven the '12 63,000 and loved it.  This turns tight, stops on a dime,  great for parking in small spaces but interior space is disappointing.   Car is comfortable, AC is very cold, heat is great.   Stops, goes great.",4

Okay I REALLY don't write reviews because I usually think they are biased, but here I go.  This is the first time I've done a serious effort in test driving cars before buying one.  Prior to this, I only leased or bought VWs - however, my last one (a beautiful 2012 GTI that was red and had plaid interior) required 3 MAJOR repairs in six months, so I had to bid her a fond farewell.  So, my uncle and I did test drives (separately) of the following cars:  Hyundai Elantra GT, Hyundai Accent hatch back, Mazda 3 hatchback, high end Toyota Prius, and Kia Soul.  I narrowed search down to the Mazda and the Accent.  The Mazda had more bells and whistles, but the Accent was a lot less expensive and the biggest selling point was the 5 year bumper to bumper warranty.  I actually upgraded to the 10 year warranty for only $1800 (which is partially refundable if I don't keep the car).  The mileage on both cars were about the same - if I wanted leather seats I would have had to spend more money and get the Mazda or the Hyundai Elantra.  I definitely wanted a hatchback and the Accent's cargo space seemed a lot bigger than the Mazda.  The interior gadgets are minimal - while I miss my hands free calling, I don't miss it enough to spend another $5-8K.  So, I'd recommend you consider this car - my purchase price was great and I have to honestly say that the car dealership has been terrific.",4

Noticed the layout under the hood could be better especially the upper radiator hose accessibility. I do a lot of my own maintenance and accessibility to components is very important.

2923, on 07/13/16 10:51 AM (PDT),Mike Gender ,2016 Hyundai Accent  SE 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 6M),One up from a skateboard," I traded my 2006 Hyundai Accent for this 2016 Hyundai Accent and unfortunately the 2006 is a better car; better in quality, gas mileage, and comfort. The 2016 doesn't even come with a spare tire, nor tools to change it. You have to call roadside assistance, wait an hour, because the car don't come with a spare, they tow you to a repair facility. The car has a economy switch that you can push on to get better fuel economy, but it gets better fuel economy, with the switch off. My 2006 got better mph (34 mph) the 2016 (32 mph) The inside of the trunk and the lid is only primered, like they just gave up. The seats are hard and uncomfortable. The car is probably the worst manufactured car ever made.I now have 17000 miles on this 2016 Accent, and my second impression of this Accent hasn't been any better. Besides no spare tire, and the hassle that presents, this car came with nitro in the tires; So, when one of my tires is low, you cant go to the service station and put air in it, you have to go to an authorized nitro replacement station and get it pumped up. This nitro refill doesn't consist of one squirt of nitro, its deflating all tires and refilling them (and paying 30.00 dollars to do so). I cant believe Hyundai would even think of such a thing, a simple review online of nitro reveals that it has minimal effect. Hyundai did away with the spare tire to impress US Government regulators on the Accents gas mileage, but I don't know what Accent they used to provide figures, but this Accent I drive gets horrible gas mileage, while delivering poor engine performance. I have 24000 miles on the car now. I finally got brave and took it out past 6 pm. I find that the angle of the roof makes it hard to see out of the car at night. The fourth of a mirror on the driver side that helps with the blind side is worthless at night. The car has severe wind and road noise on the inside that constantly has you thinking that either the window or the door is open.  The car still gets unacceptable gas mileage and is just a poor quality produced car.",1

The Yaris while a sub compact car doesn't leave you with the "" point a to b "" I'm here felling.  My drive consisted of in town,  and paved county back roads. The Yaris is what it is,  a small 4 cyl 4 door car,  BUT-    It DOSENT have the sub compact fell every bump in the road fell.  Ride is actually good for a small car and steering is responsive as well is the small motor,  of corse it dose get a bit loud if you get into it,  but the response is actually a little more than you would expect,  with small cars there's always trade offs.  The Yaris has no problem getting out in traffic but with sprinted driving the trade off is going to be in gas mileage at some point,  not that you would notice lol. The inside is actually what you would expect but Toyota found a way to bring it up a bit.  Front seats are surprisingly comfortable with lower back side bolsters that kinda hug your lower sides,  nice touch. The sound system in my car had the 6+"" touch screen and even a pillar tweeters.  Sound quality was actually SURPRISING with plenty of volume.  Controls for everything were well laid out and easy to reach.  So,  over all Toyota has done a great job putting together a cute and enjoyable sub compact commuter car.  Its not for everyone granted,  but those looking into a sub compact for mainly commuting and running errands owe it to there selves to test drive a Yaris,  the only thing I could ask for is cruse control,  but I'm willing to do without because of the gas mileage,  nice sound system,  and surprisingly comfortable front seats.

Poor acceleration, low engine power.  I commute 45 minutes each way, mostly on Interstate and divided highways.  The seats are not bad.  I could drive this car for 5 or 6 hours or more without getting bedsores, as some would have you think.  My 2016 LE model has AC, Cruise control and a nice Entune radio with bluetooth, which does a great job of picking up my audio from my iPhone and displaying the name of the song on screen.  Anybody who buys this car and then complains about its lack of power did not do their research and is suffering from unrealistic expectations.  Its a basic car with minimal frills and it does a good job at being that.  I find that a lot of professional reviewers are former race car drivers and very experienced at driving exotic performance cars and look at the Yaris with a jaundiced eye.   Non-professional reviewers are boy-racer wannabes and have unrealistic expectations for sure.  Not all reviews can be generalized like this, but a lot of them are unrealistic.",4

Last weekend I drove to Kansas from Colorado and back in a day, and it was killing me. After driving the car for 5 hours and a little over 400 miles I was limping at the gas station. 300 miles later I got out to walk around and was limping from the pain of my foot the entire time. I switched out with the co-driver and she said after just driving for an hour her leg and thigh was killing her. The foot peddle is small and really hard to keep at the right speed, there is no cruse control and the speed gauge goes in increments of 10 so you don't know how fast you are going. Having to keep looking at the speed gauge every 10 seconds to see that you are speeding or not makes this unsafe because YOU ARE NOT WATCHING THE ROAD! which makes this an unsafe car to drive even in the city. When we finally got back to Colorado I could barley walk to the front door of our house and 3 days later my foot still hurts.",1

2936, on 05/09/18 04:56 AM (PDT),Steve Swier ,2018 Hyundai Accent  SE 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 6M),Spark plug failure at 140 miles," My son needed a car to replace his 1999 Ford Escort, so I decided to sell him my 2013 Toyota Corolla and buy a 2018 Hyundai Accent. I figured my  son would have a reliable five year old car, and I'd have a reliable new car. I was half right; my son now has a reliable car. The Accent seemed like a good car in my test drives. It has a six speed manual transmission and 1.6 liter engine. It was easy to get used to the clutch, it shifted smoothly, and had sufficient power, and the average MPG indicated 47 for the combination of highway and city driving that I have on my commute. The ride is fairly firm. It's quieter at highway speed than the Corolla. However, at about 140 miles, the car started running rough and the Check Engine light came on. It felt like the car was running on two cylinders. I pushed in the clutch and revved the engine, and the problem seemed to clear up. But as I continued driving, there were occasional surges. Then, on an uphill, the car felt like it was missing. We managed to get home, and had the car towed to the dealer. They replaced the spark plugs. I'm not sure what kind of spark plugs last only 140 miles, but I hope the replacements are of higher quality. We'll see what happens with the new plugs. I didn't used to carry a cell phone, but now I've got one so that I can call my wife and a tow truck next time the car breaks down. I'm not too happy that I got rid of a reliable car and replaced it with an unreliable, unsafe car; but I'm stuck with this until I can save enough money to replace it.",1

The extended warranty does not cover tires. Obviously I was thinking no problem, the tires aren't worn out, the leaking shocks caused the feathering on the tires which caused excessive road noise and vibration. Although the defective shocks caused the problem the warranty still will not cover the tires. New (installed) tires are $250 each. Aside from that, the gas tank under the front seat is uncomfortable you cannot put your feet near the seat, only forward when resting your non driving leg. The charging ports are in the worst location ever. Don't expect to be able to reach them while driving. The cup holders are too deep or too short. Try putting a 16oz coffee cup in there. You can't get it back out and if you put the flap down to raise the cup up it will topple ever and spill. The seats are uncomfortable and make your lower back hurt. Had to turn the head rest backward or you have to slouch because it's angled so far forward. The interior material is very cheap as is the rest of the car. The plastic handle jams and is going to break any day now. This car is 1.5 years old with lots of highway miles. The only thing I REALLY like is how the back seats flip up or lay down for more storage. Good price point but I guess you get what you pay for. 36 mpg average is good too.",3
2943, on 06/20/18 08:21 AM (PDT),Kristen ,2017 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Great car other than a few minor details," When I first purchased the HR-V I loved it. It drove better than my previous car had a sun roof, blue tooth and I love the camera features that come with it, such as the right turn camera located in the side mirror (I dont understand why they couldn't have put that on the left side too). After a month of owning the car I was rear ended at a traffic light and ever since, my HR-V hasnt been right. The dealership replaced my back hatch and all was good. Until it started making a rattling noise which they say was the strut. So after replacing that I've since been in and out of the dealership for the same noise. They have replaced both struts, shocks and anything they could think of that would be the problem. A couple weeks went by and the problem seemed to be fixed, but nope. Still making that noise and it drives me crazy. I shouldnt be having this problem with a brand new vehicle. The review I really wanted to leave about this car is about the windshield. Im not sure if anyone else has this problem but I feel like the windshield is at a weird angle or too close to the driver because the way the sun beats down on me is like no other car I've been in. I have to turn the A/C on full blast at my fact to even feel a little of it. This in turn makes my feet and overall body sweat while im driving and I hate it. I hope I'm not the only one having this problem. My last complaint is that I hate the 4-cylinder but thats not a problem with the car just my personal preference. I do see they came out with a turbo option in the 2018 version which would have been nice. Overall, I love the car but just wish I could change the windshield.",3

Fuel economy so far has been better than I expected (particularly hwy). The control panel is awkward but once you get used to it it's not so bad; I use the volume control on steering wheel most of the time and wish there was a MUTE feature located there.

2949, on 11/12/17 13:55 PM (PST),New Honda Driver ,2017 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl 6M),Nice car," Never having owned any sort of SUV and knowing Honda to be a reliable brand, I went there thinking to see the CR-V.  I asked to see the 'small SUV' and was shown the HR-V instead, which I did not know about.  It was several thou less in price, perfectly sized for what I wanted a small SUV and knowing Honda to be reliable, went there and asked to see their small SUV thinking it would be the CR-V and was shown the HR-V which was new to me.  However, it was a fine size, smaller slightly than the CR-V, fine for two people and dogs and periodic need for carrying amounts of things.  After a test drive, decided to buy.  No regrets so far, 5 months into ownership.  Side by side on the street with the much more commonly seen CR-V, it does not seem much smaller; personally, I don't see the reason to plunk down a few thousand more for the CR-V over the HR-V.  Mileage is OK but not great.  Stability on road is fine, road comfort at fwy speeds fine, little road noise.  One sits up higher and visibility is good. Back seats folded down provide excellent carrying capacity; they also have a pull-up thing which makes the rear passenger foot space like a deep well which should be useful at times.  There is good room up front for someone at 6 foot two and decent back seat room as well.  This is the mid level model which for a little more than the lower end one is very nicely equipped; the upper tier is for folks who don't much care about money being spent or simply must have something it offers.   I must say the Honda colors do truly suck, though: white, red, variations on black and grey, and a purple blue which is what we have.  More purple than blue but there it is.  Saw no need for a 4 wheel drive, so bought the 2 and saved another thousand or so.  Even though we bought it on the last day of the month, toward the end of the day, we still had to do the irritating back and forth with the manager/salesperson: that alone is enough to put anyone off buying a car for the duration....  The true test will be in 2-4 years but knowing people who have owned Hondas for years, I expect this will last a good long time.",4

Wonder what purpose the HDMI port really serves??  Sort of wish the EX had electric seat adjustment for driver's seat but all in all given cost I am extremely happy with my choice of the HR-V.    If you decide on getting extended warranty do not jump at the 1st offer.   It is negotiable for sure.  Updated after 7 months of ownership:   still really happy with the vehicle on all counts.   Now that I am used to the interior and touch screen features I have improved that rating.   The key fob is extremely convenient and now that I am used to it can't imagine being without one.,5
2951, on 09/21/17 20:17 PM (PDT),Christine ,2017 Honda HR-V  EX-L w/Navigation 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Continuous door locking," For the past year I have been telling the Valley Honda dealership about the continuous door locking and unlocking, which they say they never here  and always send me on my way with a different reason it could be saying they have never heard of this issue with any vehicle. Another time my hatch would not open had to take to shop, no clear reason was given to the cause.   Another time key fob locked in car and doors would not open.   When I was out of town battery went dead when door locks would not quit continuously locking and unlocking.   The seat leather is not quality passenger seat has a small imperfection where leather is pulling apart and I rarely have a passenger except for my purse in the passenger seat. I am dissatisfied with the dealership putting me off on these issues for a year now.  Updating I no longer own the HRV, traded it in at Delaney Honda in Indiana Pa.  The dealership was very friendly, competent and made my purchase and trading in the HRV a pleasure and exciting they are definitely worth the drive if you don’t live close.   Delaney Honda informed me that I did have extended warranty on the HRV that I traded in and I was due a full refund of my extended warranty purchased which I was told by Valley Honda, Monroeville Pa that I did not have and would have to pay for all repairs.  I followed up at Valley Honda with sales Manager to get my full refund of the extended warranty I purchased.  After getting my check and voicing my displeasure and dishonesty reguarding this matter, The sales manager at Valley Honda had no reply at all not even a simple apology, very rude.  I highly recommend Delaney Honda, Indiana Pa if you are in the market for a new vehicle, they have integrity and honesty.",2

The only two things I wish it had was power seats and an electric hatch. Other than that the car is great.  Car has a back up camera and right turn lane signal camera which comes in very handy.

Just a few things I'd like to see different but overall very nicely equipped and a great value. Took ride to visit up North about 3K miles and got 33+ mpg and that's cruising with everyone else with AC on. Has a very nice ride and the handling is outstanding. Plan to keep this little gem for quite sometime.Update 2/4/18: Still enjoying this vehicle!  Try it you will like it.,5

It is spacious for all 4 of us, and all of of our stuff too! After 5 long months of looking for the perfect fit for our family, Fischer Honda in Ypsilanti MI really took care of us. It was a nice change to deal with positive people who want to provide you with a great car. 100% Recommend.",5
2957, on 06/05/17 09:11 AM (PDT),Christine Wojciechowski ,2017 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl 6M),Sporty HR-V," It is a great small SUV.  Coming from the CR-V, it sits a little lower and there isn't as much arm room because of the middle console.  But it is a great little car.  The back seats fold up and down to make it possible to carry a variety of sizes of cargo.  It is a 4 door which I didn't realize at first because the handles for the back door are up by the windows.  Great car for the money.",5
2958, on 03/17/17 10:30 AM (PDT),MG Brown ,2017 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Consider the HR-V for your second or third car.," It is just slightly a month after delivery of our Honda HR-V EX AWD.There were certain dealer-installed options that we wanted, and we found after using the ‘build your Honda’ tool on their website, that installation and other required installation kits were not included in the price of the options. This raised the price considerably and was a bit of a sticker shock. If you are planning to have options installed, check the price of labor, etc. on the Honda e-store for a more realistic bottom line price.Speaking of dealer installation charges, shop around before buying or ordering your HR-V. We saved a substantial amount of money buying either OEM or third party accessories from eBay and Amazon. I feel anyone can ‘install’ a rear cargo tray or floor mats so why pay the dealer’s labor charge for something that you can do yourself?We feel that the HR-V is a good choice for a second or third car (our case) for a small family or a childless couple. In many ways, the HR-V is a throwback to when families had a low-end station wagon as a second car for hauling people or cargo. With the price being what it is- I can imagine some young families looking at the LX model for an only car. I'm not sure if the HR-V is the best choice for an only car so I'd advise people such as that to shop around.Honda surprised us by including some features as standard on the HR-V that I would consider to be luxury oriented and not including some features that I would call practical in nature. For example- both of our other cars have push button memory seats (not available in the HR-V) which is extremely helpful if you have 2-3 people who drive all of the cars.As with most Hondas made in the last 20 years or so, major options are by package so if you want XM satellite radio, you have no choice but to pay for leather seating and navigation also. It’s a shame that you can’t pick and choose more features but I assume it’s that way to keep costs down.I read other reviewers complaining about driver positioning; I can only assume that they have not read their owners manual because our EX model has tilt and telescope steering wheel as well as seat height and backrest tilt adjustments. I am a tall guy but with some adjusting, I can get reasonably comfortable in the HR-V driver compartment.My only interior complaint is that both driver and passenger seating areas have an encroachment by the front wheel well into the interior which pushes back my left leg when driving or right leg when I am the passenger by about an inch. This is just enough to be slightly uncomfortable when driving but less so when I am the passenger. If you are tall or have a long inseam, this may be a consideration for you too.Others have complained about the HR-V’s engine performance; I believe that Honda changed the engine mapping for 2017 and our AWD version gets down the road nicely. I can’t imagine anyone buying an HR-V expecting it to be a rocket. We feel the power and torque are more than adequate and at the same time it delivers good to great fuel economy.The AWD on our HR-V proved its worth after the first heavy snowfall in our area and unless you are really on a tight budget, I’d certainly suggest you get the AWD version.We had another car in the past with a CVT automatic and the HR-V has some of the same characteristic transmission and power train noise that the other car had. It’s a shame because most Honda automatics are relatively quiet.I have heard that some people have complained about Honda not including Apple Play or the Android equivalent in the HR-V. We feel that the HondaLink system included in the EX is all that we need and quite easy and intuitive to use. I understand the infotainment system in the LX is different so perhaps those that have complained have the LX.Our HR-V is a fun and versatile vehicle. The various cargo configurations such as ‘long mode’ and the magic seats in the 2nd row make for a lot of options when transporting stuff from here to there.We have found the HR-V to be a crossover that does almost everything well; it is very practical and economical as well as having a handsome appearance without too much glitz and gadgetry.",4
2959, on 03/01/17 12:58 PM (PST),Trasid ,2017 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl 6M),I <3 my HR-V!," I test drove many different vehicles.  Along with Honda's history of vehicle reliability, I picked the HR-V for the following reasons:  It's a great looking vehicle with great mpg.  (I am averaging 36 mpg on each tank of gas and I expect that to get better!)  It's very reasonably priced for a vehicle that has heated seats, a backup camera, a right turn lane/signal camera, push start and a moon roof.  The front seats sit a bit higher and are much easier to get in and out of as compared to the civic.",4
2960, on 02/13/17 09:41 AM (PST),Ben ,2017 Honda HR-V  EX-L w/Navigation 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),You will love this car!!," Where to start - I have never liked the 'CRV' 's look - so i was in between the HRV and the Civic. The HRV has all wheel drive where the civic does not, and it's higher up which i like. I LOVE this car...everything i could want. Hopefully Honda puts in electric hatch and apple play but besides that: perfect!!  Acceleration is not the greatest. This is the best car i have ever owned, and don't go for the lower grades....spend the extra money for comfy HEATED leather seats. YOu won't be sorry if you get this CROSSOVER / SUV.",4
2961, on 09/15/15 12:23 PM (PDT),Dan Dormio ,2017 Honda HR-V  EX-L w/Navigation 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Went from 2007 Fit Sport to HR-V EX to 2017 HRV EX," I knew basically what I wanted but did not know what would give it to me. I looked around and had never heard of the HR-V until I was looking at a CR-V and remarked to the salesman that it was bigger than I wanted. He asked if I had looked at the HR-V. He had one. I looked it over and the salesman and I took a test drive. It had the magic seats that I really liked in the Fit. It was bigger, which I was looking for, quieter, nicer ride, etc. The features were excellent although the USB, HDMI, and 12 volt power supply are inconveniently located. At the time I was driving my F150. I took it home and came back with my Fit. I then took the HR-V for a ride by myself. I took it home and got my wife and we went for a ride, curvy road, highway, etc. I just had to have it back before the dealership closed. This was a Saturday. I bought it the next week. I just returned from a trip where I drove from Arkansas to Maryland and back. I have no regrets. The car performed fine in every respect, ride, comfort, mileage, etc. The automatic climate control is wonderful. I filled up in Cumberland, MD and stopped for the night in Morehead, Kentucky with still about a third of a tank of gas. I filled up when I left Morehead and had a third of a tank or so when I got home. I used the Honda Nav app that I downloaded to my IPhone as my GPS. I carried my regular GPS along just in case. The Honda Nav App was great. A $60.00 down load, an HDMI cable, a lightning adapter from Best Buy, and a USB charge cord for the IPhone to keep the phone charged and forget the regular GPS. It runs through the 7"" display. I am extremely pleased with the HR-V, price, features, ride, everything. I had no problems in the mountains in West Virginia or Maryland. I mostly left it on economy the whole trip until I hit the mountains and then I turned it off for the the extra power. Car did fine.I now have approximately 16k miles on it. Have had it about 54 weeks. I have taken it to northern Illinois, Maryland 4 times, and Florida once. I am extremely happy with the HRV. I will be taking it to south Dakota soon. Note, it cruised the SD 80 mph speed limit with no problem and I have had no problems in the mountains with it. I basically set economy on and left it. Very seldom do I take it out of economy.I had my 2016 HRV EX for approximately 14 months. I put approximately 18,800 miles on it. I had no complaint with the car at all. I traded it in about 5 months ago on a 2017 HRV EX-L-Navi-AWD.  The main reason I traded was I wanted an AWD. I took it to northern Illinois over Christmas. I cannot say anything negative about the HRV at all. Even with the upgrade to AWD it still gets good mileage, although I did drop some from the 2 wheel drive, but then that is to be expected. The HRV goes about 10,000 miles between oil changes. For me it has been a great car. I wanted something bigger than the Fit but smaller than the CRV. The HRV fit the bill perfectly. It rides and handles well. Acceleration is very adequate but it is not a race car. The acceleration, even on mountains is very adequate. I have run mountains in Arkansas, Kentucky, Maryland, West Virginia, and South Dakota. In my opinion they are great cars. Just returned from a 12 day trip to Arizona. Have also taken the 2017 HRV to northern Illinois and Maryland. Will be going to Maryland again, likely within the next 3 weeks. I love the car. It is plenty big and comfortable for two people to travel in. We also have a Honda Cross Tour. It is a very nice car also. We used it for trips until I got the HRV. Now we use the HRV for trips. If we were traveling with more than just my wife and I we would use the Cross Tour but the HRV is perfectly fine for two people to travel in. Plenty of room for our stuff, plus souvenirs and stuff we pick up along the way.",5
2962, on 07/04/17 18:37 PM (PDT),Gene O ,2017 Mazda CX-3  Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),solid tank of a car," This car feels like a hybrid of a small tank and a porsche.  The car handles excellently and because of the way this car handled and steered on a test drive, I picked the CX3 over a subaru crosstrek - an uninspired driving disappointment, by comparison.  The CX3 is not quite a utility vehicle.  It's more like a station wagon that's a little jacked up higher off the ground and has AWD. It feels powerful with a 2L engine and has good acceleration if you drop the pedal. In the snow, it bites and drives great.  Bad weather is no match - snow, ice, rain - it can handle any of that stuff.  Several inches of wet snow and going uphill - barely a slip. It's a little beast.  On the highway its smooth sailing and very good MPG. You don't get a huge gas tank - max range is about 295-300 miles.  Comfortable interior and lots of USB ports and stuff for phones and other junk you want to plug in. the touch screen has good visibility and all the functions work well - good ergonomics with the console dial, voice control, rear camera and steering wheel buttons. The inside climate control is a little wonky - it's not easy to get it just right for some reason. either you get ice cold air or something that doesn't defrost your glass or something that's hot....odd.  Sometimes my kid likes to sit in the middle of the back seat when I drive and he's very close to me there - like a parrot on my shoulder - which I'm not crazy about.  The back seats are not huge. He says they're comfortable.  A USB port or two back there would be cool instead on me having to run a wire from the front. the cargo area is big enough for me to carry 2 hockey equipment bags for both my kids and most other bulky stuff but it's not huge, either, which is something I happily accept for what the car is. It has a small sub-section under the floor so you can make it a little bigger, if you want. Stereo may sometimes have a little buzz if you set the bass all the way up to max. My pet peeve with the CX3 is that the outside back of the car gets FILTHY with road stuff and spray. I suppose a set of mudflaps would fix that.  If you're driving on wet and salted roads, the back of the car is coming home covered in a filthy grime of road salt.  Not nearly as bad in summer when roads are cleaner. Even a good car wash has trouble eliminating all that filthy grime off the back so there's the Achilles's heel of the CX3.",5

2964, on 12/28/16 13:38 PM (PST),kobelco ,2017 Mazda CX-3  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),AWD GT with i-active sense package," I live in Minneapolis and wanted a small vehicle with AWD. Choices were between this CX-3 and Subaru Impreza. Bought this car five days ago. I'm writing about initial impressions, will update (if I can) later with more extensive use. Absolutely love this car! Great acceleration, great handling, great mpg. Looks and feels just right. Interior space is an issue though, obviously not the most important factor as I would not have bought the car if it was. With the car seat in the back, there is space for one other person comfortably. Trunk space is the least I've seen in almost any car I can recall. But this is meant to be my commuter car, primarily to be driven around the city. Entertainment screen and control is mostly intuitive, though I had to fiddle around a bit to learn all the aspects that you can control. Interior is snazzy with two-tone stitched leather. Got the remote starter and all weather floor mats from the dealership as well. The price I have mentioned is the walk-out price, including TTL.Update 2017-06-29: It's been now over 6 months and I love this car even more. Getting around 30 mpg, combined. On certain trips I've averaged 40 mpg!!The iActiveSense features are really useful: The adaptive cruise control is something that I don't think I'll drive without in any car. Auto brakes are cool. Lane departure warning is a pain and I've turned that feature off.Update 2018-01-11: After over a year of ownership, I still can't help but smile every time I get behind the wheels of my CX-3, especially after a vacation where I've not driven my car for a few days. Still averaging 30.4 mpg today.",5
2965, on 08/08/18 08:07 AM (PDT),AL ,2016 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl 6M),Fixing your HRV, This is more of a question than a review. I'm looking to buy a Honda HRV. Are they easy cars to do work on myself or do I have to bring this to a shop or dealer?,5
2966, on 07/01/18 21:10 PM (PDT),Rebecca ,2016 Honda HR-V  EX-L w/Navigation 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Love my honda!," I got this little SUV because I had a jeep liberty and wanted something that still sat up off the ground a bit, had the storage of my jeep, and still felt ""sporty"" but was better on gas.  Few things I love about this car. One the gas on it is amazing I live in Hawaii and although it's a small island I still drive quite a bit and I dont fill up but once every 2 weeks sometimes even longer. The seats sit up higher than a sedan so I still feel like I can see my surroundings and it's pretty easy to get in and out of. I'm not climbing to get in nor am I squatting to get down in it. Perfect combination. I love how this car handles the road. It hugs every curve you go through and switches lanes with ease. Which brings me to the right side mirror. Mine has the side view so u can see into the other lane by a camera on your radio, which I thought at first I would never use but I'm almost half dependent on it now. I dont feel like theres too many blind spots when checking over my shoulders to switch lanes either which is nice. The driverside mirror doesnt come with the lane watch but there is a small section already built in so you can see what's over there. The storage is great I love that I can choose to flip my rear seats up and they will stay that way as long as the bar is tucked down allowing for way more space for taller objects. The back seats also fold down completely flat and makes the entire trunk space get at least 1/3rd bigger. I'm about 5'10"" and feel like I could sleep back there. That also brings me to the room in the car. Being this tall I didnt want a car that I would feel cramped I and I have plenty of head clearance.   The back seats also have plenty of leg room so us tall people can fit wherever in this car. The heated seats are awesome too (eventually I'll use them again) but they were amazing in the winter time with the different settings for it. The speakers and radio functions are decent as well. I'm not 18 anymore and dont care to have a ""system"" in my car but this little thing will give you just the right amount of bass if your desire it. Also the radio functions are super easy to figure out. Easy to pair bluetooth with and easy to customize the color scheme to what you may want. The screen is also a touch screen and fairly sensitive so your not spending half of your time mashing your radio to get it to work. There are multiple charging options in this little car too which can prove to be more amazing than not so if you just have a USB or a actual car charger theres a place to plus your phone in about 3 total I do believe and that's just the front. The rear backup camera sits low to the ground so you can actually see where your going and dont feel like your backing up a truck. Which I have seen in other cars. So i personally feel more confident when using it. Although the backup camera is great theres a few things i would improve on it. Theres no beeping to indicate your getting close to something. There is colors showing if your in the clear or not but a beep would be nice. Also I've seen in other cars where it will help you back straight in and your car wont be half sideways. Not the case with this camera. As long as your wheels are straight it says your straight. I would fix that. The headrest are also very comfortable, it's like they have been lined with memory foam almost. One of my favorite features. So now some of the the things I dont like or would change. This is a small car and isnt meant to go 0 to 60 in 3 seconds. If your going up a hill and trying to get around a car super fast your gonna tell your car isnt up for that but other than that I have no problem it accelerates just fine to me other than getting up a hill super fast. The windshield is a little long for me but then again I'm coming from a jeep to a small SUV. And last con would be the break hold. I very VERY rarely use it. It works as its suppose to I just think it's really a useless feature that the car has. Overall I love my honda and even though I settled with this car (I wanted a Mazda cx5) I'm happy I did. I feel safe and can see all around in the car and I dont get the urge to mash the gas and go (which wouldnt really work to well in the first place) so if your 16 and its your first car or 26 and you need a family car or 96 and need something more for you I think that the honda HRV is a all around win. Sporty enough to suit the weekenders who wander but still safe and family enough to suit everybody else. Buy the car you wont be disappointed.",5

Lots of versatility in  cargo configurations.   The Magic Seat is great!  Very smooth ride and good pick up but if you need a little more, you just put it in the Sport Gear and Go!  This was a 2 year old car but an upgrade from my 2007 Dodge Caliber.  I didn't want a lot of extras on this car, that is why I chose the LX not the EX.

Not real comfortable for long trips, an hour or more, electronics hard to work, you have to hit the screen with much pressure to make it work. other than that the HRV is a decent car even though it's feel is not the usual Honda quality feel and if this is your first new Honda, you will probably like it. This is my 16th New Honda since 89 so I expect a lot from Honda and this one ranks low for me. Maybe because it was assembled in Mexico.",4

I have just purchased a support pillow to use in the vehicle and hope it helps, but after a 4 hour trip (with frequent stops) my back is still hurting with the pillow.

Blind spot camera is cool although I haven't used it much. Small, Reliably, affordable, and a great first car. Also gets good fuel economy (about 30 mpg with the car in eco mode half the time) and only takes $20 to fill up the tank when almost empty (June 2017). Heated seats are nice when cold. Ample storage for gear and groceries. Only real complaint would be that there are no LED lights on the vehicle what so ever (I know I'm picky). All in all great car, perfect for kids/young adults and easy to park.",4

2975, on 05/25/17 06:00 AM (PDT),Patrick ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Good at being adequate," I purchased a 2016 Honda HR-V LX AWD as my family's secondary vehicle which I occasionally use for work.  I had previously owned a Jeep Renegade that I absolutely loved and my wife had a 2015 Subaru Crosstrek.  (we traded in both our Renegade and a Subaru Crosstrek for a Jeep Grand Cherokee as we wanted something bigger and I had a company car at the time - then I switched jobs and lost the company car, so we needed something ASAP).  My primary reason for getting the HR-V vs. the Renegade or Crosstrek was that for an equally equipped Crosstrek, I was looking at about $25,000, and for an equally equipped Renegade about $27,000.  The HR-V came in at $22,500 sticker price.  I liked the styling of the HR-Vs I had seen on the road, went by the Honda Dealership and got a great deal on a left-over 2016.  I am now about 3,000 miles into owning the vehicle and my experience has been ... adequate.  There is nothing overly exciting about the HR-V.  It isn't a bad looking vehicle, but it isn't an eye catcher.  It just kind of is what it is.  I enjoy the handling of the HR-V, it is great for tight parking lots, around town and city traffic driving. There is a zippy, go-cart feel to the HR-V, reminiscent of driving around my old 1987 Honda Prelude I had in college.  It is also surprisingly solid on the highway and has a solid, upright seating position that feels surprisingly like a real SUV (vs. complaints I always had with my wife's Crosstrek which felt unsecure on the highway and I felt like I was sitting on the floor).  I have never had an issue with acceleration.  I constantly see complaints about acceleration in other people's reviews.  Ok, if you're looking for a sports car, this isn't it.  But one thing I feel everyone overlooks is that if you want better acceleration, there is a ""sport mode"" you can put the HR-V in which gives you just that at the expense of some MPG.  The cargo / storage versatility of the vehicle is its high point as there is a lot of cargo space when the seats are down.  The ""Magic Seats"" are a cool car showroom gimmick but I honestly have never used them nor do I see a need to.  I have not yet had the opportunity to drive in bad winter conditions.    Ok, now to the negatives:  The MPG is not at all what I had hoped for.  The Renegade I had averaged about 26 MPG mixed use, and my wife's Crosstrek averaged about 31.  I am in 3000 miles right around 26 with 90% highway driving, sport mode off and eco mode on.  I will get 30-31 on a straight highway trip, but I am not impressed considering the Renegade got that, and in the Crosstrek we would be at 40+ mpg with straight highway driving.  I did not have either of those vehicles long enough to ""break them in"" either (both had around 10,000 miles when we traded them in, and I was getting that kind of gas mileage from the start).  So I would say the HR-V falls short in terms of MPG.  Also, the back seat is just plain awful.  Yes, there is good leg room and head room (awesome actually), but the seat design is uncomfortable.  The head reads fold down into the seat to provide the driver with better rear views.  If you have someone sit in the back seat, you have to pull the head rests up.  The seat back is still very low with the head rest providing most of your upper back support.  It has a jump seat feel to it .. it might work for kids, but as a 5'10, 200 lb. adult, I found it to be very uncomfortable.  Another complaint is that there are cheap materials throughout the vehicle.  The deck of the cargo area is practically felted cardboard.  I purchased the OEM cargo trey/liner which was not any better.  The carpeted floor mats the vehicle came with are cheap so I purchased weather tech mats.  My number 1 complaint is that with the LX non-leather version I have, the door sills are upholstered with fabric instead of a wipe able surface.  This means that if it is raining and you open the door, it gets soaked.  Since its fabric, it holds the moisture.  I had to exit my vehicle in a parking lot downpour and the door became completely soaked.  I am concerned how this will hold up over time.  I also feel that Honda could have done better with the ground clearance. I bought a crossover AWD vehicle to handle NE Ohio snowstorms, beach driving, and the occasional camp road or muddy event parking field.  With 6.7"" ground clearance there is no chance for beach driving.  Yes, I knew this going into buying the vehicle ... but considering the HR-V's competitors all have 8+"" of ground clearance, I feel like they missed the mark.  I have scraped the underside of the nose on some parking space curbs - in my opinion that shouldn't happen with a crossover.  Hopefully with the next generation HR-V, Honda will have made these small little tweaks which would turn an adequate crossover into a great one.  By then, I'll probably have traded it in for a Renegade or Crosstrek.",4

This car is a big rattle trap! Driver seat squeaking, rattles from the rear end, rattles from the dash, rattles from the sunroof, and several more that I care not to get into. It didn't matter if the road was smooth or bumpy, the issues were prevalent. I finally had enough and traded it for a 2017 Honda Civic EX-T Coupe. I figured that since my daughter has a 2016 Civic EX-T sedan since December 2015 with excellent gas mileage and no issues, I would give the Civic a try. So far, I LOVE IT!",2

It goes from a solid , smooth driving car to one that vibrates excessively. I took it into Racine Honda after 5 days and complained about it. They took it out for a ""test drive"" and the ""service guy"" said he didn't feel any vibration and suggested that it was a new car, tight suspension, etc etc. Car was fine in his opinion. Bottom line, not looking forward to any long roadtrips with this car:(",4

I knew this was the car for me from the second I sat in it. I find that the seats are very comfortable, unlike some other reviewers.

2983, on 01/27/17 10:18 AM (PST),Valerie ,2016 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),from Civic to HRV, I ABSOLUTELY love this car. I was very hesitant at first because I just wanted to replace my civic that was totaled in a car accident. My husband kept saying just test drive it and see. I mean I loved the look but said no. Well when I started to look at the civics and don't know if it was me or that they seemed to be lower than the one I had. So I went to look at the CRV. Still not even looking in the HRV's direction. Test drove the CRV and I was like OK I can do this. But still on the fence. I am only 4 foot 11 so I felt the CRV was a bit on the big side. I was really stuck. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis so getting a civic was not out of the question. When I have flares it would be hard for me to get in and out of the car because it was just to low. The CRV seemed to be the better fit but finally the salesman was like lets just take a look at the HRV. I think it's what you are looking for. When I went to sit in the HRV let me tell you. It fit like a glove. The ease of getting in and out of the car was so easy. My kids have plenty of room in the back seat. I have great space in my cargo area. I mean this car is perfect. It drives great. I did read about the speed and it drives great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Now let me get to the few thinks I don't really care for but deal with because like I said I love this car.  The cup holder is not that great. If you have a medium drink or larger you are good. but if you have a small drink the lift for that size is not very promising. I find myself holding the cup because I feel it will fall out of the cup holder.  The middle console armrest is pretty small. maybe a few pens.  Where they have put the charging plugs in the front is OK but i would much rather have easier access.  Now this is one think I don't understand. The passenger can usually lock the car if the driver happens to step out when parked. But you can't in this car. They have to lean over to the driver's side to lock the car. (If someone knows how it can be done please let me know)  The problems I see are so minor that I tell everyone that asks me about my HRV to go and test drive it and they will see for themselves this is a great car.,5
2984, on 01/27/17 09:50 AM (PST),TheGuySubmittingThisReview ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),HRV exceeds expectations.. Until you use the radio," I got this car out of college, coming from my parent's 2006 Lexus RX330 (it was old but it was a tank, befitting of a 16 year old). Most of my driving in cities, taking trips under 5 miles. Turn radius is excellent, you'll think you're in a smaller car. Parking-including parallel, is a breeze. Both cameras are excellent, the backup has a wide view so you can see the periphery and lanewatch lets you change lanes without turning your head. Brake hold is amazing, and I don't know why this wasn't a feature decades ago. I can actually take my foot off the brake at a stoplight and not worry. In the city, I averaged about 13mpg in the RX(rated 16). In the HRV I average about 24 (rated 27). Taking road trips (~65mph), I would average about 24 in the RX (rated 22), and I get about 33 in the HRV (Rated 31). I'm averaging 27 for the life of the car (9months, 8k miles). The best I've gotten on the highway is 36 after driving about 2 hours at 65mph. 2WD mileage is likely better. Acceleration is fine. It's not as fast as my family's now illegal Jetta TDI, but it's comparable to the RX. I've never had problems passing on the highway; it's just not impressive if you ever go pedal to the metal. Acceleration is improved in sport mode (keeps the engine at a higher RPM), but you lose about 5mpg. As for ECO mode, I've noticed AC it gets severely nerfed. If you live somewhere warm you'll want to keep ECO off. In cruise control, ECO mode is also lackluster. Resuming to 65mph from a full stop at a stoplight took about 25 seconds-in this time 18 cars passed me on the left. I didn't know why it was so slow until I turned ECO mode off-suddenly cruise control accelerated at an acceptable rate. It's fine if you're maintaining speed, but if you have to slow down or come to stops on a long trip, you'll want to turn ECO off. I also haven't noticed a significant increase in efficiency in ECO mode; at best it might be 1-2mpgs. For the interior, space is great. I'm 6' and it's ""almost"" tight, I have the seat as low as possible, but I still fit comfortably. Backseat space is excellent. Easily fits 5+carry-ons. Magic seats are excellent. I was able to fit an entire queen bed frame (disassembled) in the car by folding the seats down. Every time I'm packing a ton of stuff I'm amazed by how much space this car has; sometimes I wonder if there's some voodoo going on. Interior build quality is excellent. I have the cloth seats (leather was not work $4k to me), and I appreciate the soft touch materials. It makes it a lot more comfortable than than the hard plastic materials in the jetta. The fo-leather on the dash looks stylish. It's hysterical to watch some new passengers try to figure out where the back door handles are. My biggest issue is the entertainment controls. They are terrible. TERRIBLE. Changing sources takes 2-4 touchscreen presses, and some buttons are so small you have to take your eyes off the road to look. Climate controls are slightly better since it's black on white, which is easier to see in your peripheral. Still not great. I find myself relying on the steering wheel controls to control volume and other audio functions. That's not a story of ""Great! The steering buttons work fantastic!""; it's a story of ""The touchscreen is so bad that I'm taking every opportunity to avoid it"". It's also unintuitive-I find it easier to change something myself than explain the layout to a passenger. I did buy a phone mount that snaps onto the air vent and offers wireless charging to my phone, and I connect over bluetooth. That works like a charm, and it lets me easily change audio sources within my phone (podcast republic, pandora, spotify, etc) and use google maps. Connecting my wireless charger, I did notice one big drawback-the ports. My EX comes equipped with a car outlet, two USB ports, and a HDMI input. first off, the HDMI is worthless. It lets you pump something to the display, but only when the car is stopped. I don't see any point in connecting something like a laptop to a SMALLER screen. If you want it for the audio, just use bluetooth. The USB ports don't provide enough power to charge a cell phone. They're meant for data only (mp3 hookup). This perplexes me both because EVERYONE is going to try to charge their cell phone from those ports, and NO ONE is in a scenario where they'll benefit from 2 MP3 hookups. I dunno what they were thinking, and I had to get a usb adapter for the power socket. In conclusion, this is a great car for the city and highway. I just got my first oil change, and have had no maintenance or repair issues other than the tow hook cover coming off in a wash ($100? really?). It gives you headroom without sacrificing MPGs. The electronics need some redesigning for usability, but for its price point, the HRV is a 9/10, magical automobile. Give me android auto and it'll be a 10/10.",5
2985, on 01/22/17 19:40 PM (PST),Edgar S. ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),one of the worst vehicle purchases I ever made," Having owned Honda vehicles the past few years, 1996 accord , 2000 CRV. I thought the quality will stay the same if not a little better. I was dead wrong. I have low standards, however, I got this car for my daughter, thinking that Honda reliability will make us be worry free for the next few years. First issue, front windshield blurry in the bottom inch before the dashboard, hey, what can you do , its not perfect, its a $21000 dollar vehicle, not gonna bring it to the dealership to replace it, we can live with that. Second issue , no engine temperature gauge, I mean come on now, how hard can it be for Honda to put that in, okay , I guess we can just get a scan gauge to remedy the issue. Third issue, its been raining here in Los Angeles, the past few days, and guess what? the rear passenger side has some leaks ,primarily the seat belt is soaking wet, aside from that the trunk has leaks too, in the same side. I mean, wow , this is supposed to be Honda...what happened to your quality control.?I've only had the HRV for 6 months, at 6300 miles, garage kept . pampered and babied like my other old Hondas..Now I have to bring it the dealerships here in L.A. I'm not sure how long they will fix it or not and they might not even offer a loaner car, I think, hope i'm wrong ...what a disappointment.

I drove for over an hour with the AC on max and it felt like I had a fan blowing in my face. It never got cool. If the temp is over 80 be ready to sweat. The dealership told me it was an economy car with an economy heating/cooling system. And they totally correct!! The heater would eventually heat up but the the air was never cool. I kept it on max at all times. Test it on a hot day, with the car sitting in the sun and you will have a good example of how poorly the system works. If you just need a car without air then it's great, got great gas mileage. But I had to get rid of mine, burned up or froze 9 months out of the year",2

Ac does not cool enough, the car gets hot in minutes. The brakes make a strange sound and i can feel as if it hit my foot as I press the brakes.  I don`t feel safe at all.  Also the interior looks very nice but I only have this vehicle for ten months and the seats look like a five year old car.  The sound from the outside, inside the vehicle is too loud.

If I am park any sound from outside is heard clear inside the vehicle, sometimes people close their vehicle doors park behind me and I can hear like if someone hit my car with something.

2992, on 12/19/16 10:20 AM (PST),Jay schickling ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Nice little car with a few shortcomings," I was coming from an 07 rav 4 with 2 wheel drive.  I have bounced back and forth between compact vehicles to SUVs.  I was looking for the fuel economy of a smaller vehicle, with the safety and AWD options of an SUV.  Aside from Subarus, the options were scarce.  I'm disappointed Toyota doesn't have an option, and was excited about the upcoming Toyota CHR, but after learning it will not have an AWD drivetrain, it didnt meet my criteria.  (I'm not sure why Toyota would do that).  I also considered Mazda's cx-3 which looked promising on paper, but it had a very hatchback feel and drove extremely low to the ground.    I found the HRV to have the best blend of what I was looking for and is the first vehicle I've seen that truly ""feels"" like a small SUV inside of its cabin, but offers the drive-ability and fuel economy of a compact sedan.  The cabin has plenty of space and feels like my RAV4, but it handles like a car and has very responsive steering.  No issues with traction of AWD which are requisites in a north-eastern climate.  The vehicles continuously variable transmission takes a little while to get used to, and its admittedly under-powered.  I didn't find it straining to accelerate on the highway or anything highly noticeable, but its not peppy.  The cabin noise was less than my RAV-4 and I'm hoping that doesn't change as the vehicle ages.  The stock soundsystem and screen in the LX model are garbage and I will replace with an aftermarket headunit and integrate the factory back up camera and steering controls into that unit.   Overall I'm satisfied with the vehicle, its pretty much what I expected it to be, and was the only option on the market I found to meet all of my criteria to some degree.  My biggest disappointment was the factory warranty being slightly shorter than industry standard, and the dealer trying to push a third party warranty from zurich.  I'm guessing with Honda's reputation for reliability, the warranty is less of a concern from the manufacturers side.  I cant yet speak to reliability or cost of ownership.",4

Nice cargo space with the hatch back but lacks a little change compartment/ limited on storage compartments in the front or back seat area.

My phone seems to do a better job and I would really like the car nav to be just as good if not better because of the large screen and the sound throughout my car--very disappointed.  It would be nice if they would have an update and also install on the 2016 models too.  Another disappointment is that it can not read text messages from I phones!!??  Or emails or even email notifications!!  Very disappointed once again....perhaps Honda will send out a recall for all of us to go in for a system update?""  Another feature that seems a little clunky is the voice prompts?  But perhaps I just need more practice?  Overall I really do love this vehicle and I think it is a great value.  I would just like to see Honda offer a few more bells and whistles like a heated steering wheel and a remote control start app that I can start my car from anywhere not having to be so close in case I am in the long check out line at the grocery store.  I know the other ladies know where I am coming from especially those of us who live in cold weather!!

2997, on 11/21/16 02:39 AM (PST),Clarence S. ,2016 Honda HR-V  LX 4dr SUV (1.8L 4cyl CVT),HR-V--OVERALL GOOD BUT...," Good overall value. Interior space and layout good. My LX model has fewer tech features, just essential items, nothing fancy, no sunroof to leak, etc. Suspension needs improvement. Ride on delivery date was very rough and bouncy. Ride home was about 25 mi, let tires cool overnite, found tire press to be 35 psi on all tires. Placard reads 32psi front, 30 psi rear. Reset  tire press and ride improved slightly. Still too rough riding for a new car. Leased my suv 7/21/16, has 2000 mi as of 11/19/16. Currently, ride seems to be a little smoother, but still too rough/bouncy for a new car. Air cond seems under powered, cools but slowly and takes awhile to really cool car. I live in Hawaii and local temp is on avg- < 90 degrees. Tires are Michelins, which ride rough and are a little noisy at freeway speeds < 60 mph. I want to replace the michelins with goodyears for a smoother ride but its a lease car (3yrs/36,000 mi) so no sense buying another set of tires. However, if I had ""Bought"" the car, I definitely would sell the Michelins and get some Goodyears. After reading several buyer reviews about other service issues, poor dealer response, etc., I am glad I only have to deal with possible probs for 3 yrs, then turn in the car at lease end.  Overall, the hr-v is a good value except for the poor ride. With my low expected annual mileage, I may not experience the range of issues reported by other owners. I did get an ""Excess wear/tear"" warr to cover me when I turn in the suv.  I definitely would look at the mitsubishi outlander as a replacement suv.  So, I hope I don't have probs or service issues like other owners. If things change, I will definitely update this review. So far, no probs. Perhaps a 3-yr lease/rtn is best. Keeping my fingers crossed for no probs!!",4

I'm glad that I waited, because I purchased the HR-V this year, and it is a classic Honda vehicle.  The thing I love about the HR-V, other than it's roominess, is the fact that it actually feels beefy. I was not expecting to sit up so high, but there really is pretty good clearance on this thing. We also own a Fit, and there is considerable height difference in the two.  I recently drove it in downtown Seattle, and the thing can turn on a dime.  The handling and the drive are wonderful.  The Fit has such bad road noise, so I was hoping the HR-V wouldn't follow suite, and it doesn't.  It's very quite at 70 and even 75 mph. I have been getting about 33 mph on my commute to and from work. Overall, I love this car. I don't see too many of them on the road yet, so a lot of people will stop and ask me what kind of car it is. Love it.",5

Left-hand driver side armrest is rock hard and uncomfortable as hell.  No knobs on dashboard controls make it very difficult and awkward to adjust the music and climate controls.   A few positives with this car would be good gas mileage comfortable right arm rest for the driver seat and the right turn lane camera.

I needed the AWD and reliablity for New England winters. The HRV filed the segment I was looking at very well. I have always liked the reliability and style of Honda and Acura. I looker at the Madza CX-3 and CX-5. They were sportier but cost of ownership and reliabilty was higher. The CX-3 interior was too small and unfinished for my taste. The CX-5 was more than I wanted to spend. The very happy medium was the HRV. The safety and AWD of the CRV and sportiness of the Civic.,5

I contacted Fowler Honda in Oklahoma City and I was able to get a CR-V for over $2,000 under the MSRP and at 0.9% financing for 60%.  Honda CR-V is the best value in my opinion. The quality of the interior is just superior to other SUVs in the same price range. Mileage is very good, better than most SUVs and it looks very stylish, especially the ""cooper sunset"" a beautiful new color. I love the CR-V EX has a passenger side camera so you can see your blind spot when turning right or just in close city driving.  Also, I love the key-less entry, so that you can have the key in your pocket (or purse ladies) and walk up to the car and grab any handle and the door opens ( big plus when you are carrying a package or it is raining. The 7 inch LCD monitor is bright and easy to see.

I purchased an LX, which I absolutely LOVE.  Compared to the other small crossover/suvs in it's class, it sits higher, which is a must after driving an suv for over ten years. It also handles well, (though the ride is a bit rigid), is more spacious inside, and has intuitive controls and technology.  It is my 5th Honda, and they have all been super reliable, and long lasting, with great re-sale value.  After owning my HRV for 5 months, I am still pleased with it overall, but wish I had gotten leather interior instead of cloth.  The cloth on the seats, headrests, and doors is not very high quality, and acts almost like a dirt magnet.  It has also developed a loud squeaking/rubbing sound in the cab which I am having looked at by the dealer soon.  I also wish the headlights were brighter, and the heating/AC system was stronger and more quickly responsive.  I can definitely see/feel the difference in quality from my 2005 CRV EX, but still believe it is a good little car for the money.I have now owned my HRV for 18 months.  I said it all in my 5 month review, though now I wished I had gotten heated seats and side mirror defrosters as well since the heater is not super strong and takes awhile to warm me and the car up.  I assume because of the smallish engine.  The squeaking/rubbing sound has resolved itself (?) so that's nice.  I would buy this car again, it suits my budget and needs well.

The thing to remember is the old-school Critics are the Knobs.  Apparently, they never used a Touchpad or Smart Phone.)   -Great Gas mileage (35 mpg on the highway as promised)-SunroofCons: -Honda's Android apps are useless (Don't expect Honda to ever upgrade them to being useful.)-Garmin's Navigation that Honda uses (Honda give it up and just install Android Auto in every Honda so we can all use Google Maps or Wave.)-This is nit-picky but the front windshield wipers are both on the drivers side.

That said we chose the HR-V with the manual transmission over the CTV automatic.   From a re-sale stand point this may not be a good choice....But I am having too much fun driving this car to care!   The gearbox is easy to shift even though I have never had a ""6-speed"".   When in traffic I sometimes skip a gear, like go from first to third to fifth and sixth.   The engine has good torque down low so as long as you are not giving it a lot of gas it doesn't care.   The cornering ability is great too.   It corners like it's on rails.   I told you I was having fun with this car.   On top of all that it's getting over 31 MPG in combined city / highway driving.The other thing that amazed me was the interior space.   It is tight without being cramped.   I am 6'-1"" and 275 pounds so getting in and out of some cars can be difficult for my 70+ year old bones.   However I can easily get in the front or back seat and have plenty of head room.   The EX and EX-L models have a sunroof which takes away some headroom so I opted for the LX model.   It is easier to get in and out of than the Honda Odessey I traded in.   The cargo space is very good for a car this size and with the rear seats folded flat it's even bigger.From the outside it looks more like a sport coupe than a 4-door SUV/Crossover.

Was persuaded by all the great reviews about the handling and ""funness"" to drive. It is fun to drive and gets pretty good milage for an AWD (I'm getting about 32mpg on the highway). It is easy to see out of and steers very well. I also like that you can kick it into a manual shift mode, which is great for hilly areas or if you need some extra accelleration. Being small, its also pretty easy to park, especially with the back up camera. There are a few things though that have been annoying.   1. Reliability - after 2 1/2 years of ownership I am now on my second AC repair. 2. Electronics are hard to use. It doesn't seem very intuitive. I can never tell if I have my music on shuffle play or not. There is no indication to let you know. I still struggle with making phone calls from the car via the bluetooth connection.

No power seat adjusters in the driver seat! For the fully loaded model, this should be standard. 4. No middle seat storage up front and a crappy arm rest (that I had to purchase separately!) 5. Not fast! Take a while to speed up! PROS: I used to have a Mazda 3 fully loaded and it was loud inside. This car is quiet inside. OVERALL: for the price point it should be perfect. It needs improvement. So after less than a year, I traded the vehicle in! Wasn’t impressed.",3

I feel that I am getting a lot our of this car for the price. I did many comparisons but nothing beat the CX-3 GT with I-active. I got everything that I wanted! The blind spot monitor, smart cruse control, heads up display, lane departure, Bose, nav, and so on! The space is kind of a downside but Its just me and my girlfriend and we are average height so there is still plenty of room in the back room. I don't use the trunk much so that doesn't bother me. It is a fun car good mileage to me,my drive to work is about 5 miles and I average 30 mpg to 29 mpg. Cant wait to take it up to snow!",5
3043, on 01/21/17 09:16 AM (PST),Matt B. ,2016 Mazda CX-3  Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Mazda Cx-3 Touring - 5 months in," I have owned Hondas, VWs and Hyundais. This is my first Mazda and I am impressed now about 6k miles in and through the first recommended service.  I am approaching my review with a comparison to those types of cars, this is not a true luxury brand, so when I say things are ""great"", it is in comparison to say a Honda SUV, not an Audi.  If you pay 10k more for a car, you get more.  I find the ride, which for me is a mix of highway and local roads everyday, to be smooth and pretty quiet.  I am easily able to achieve the listed MPG  and typically land around 30ish.  Note that I do my own calculation based on miles traveled and gas put in as the onboard computer does over estimate by about 1mpg it seems.  I find the seats to be comfortable up front for me, although they are almost all the way back (im 6').  I have been able to fit a fair amount of stuff on a  trip to Lowes/Home Depot into this thing with the seats down.  Its not huge, but for standard household projects, it gets the job done.  So far zero issues in the world of maintenance.  On the negative side, and these are things you just have to decide if they matter to you are - no interior storage.  The cup holder locations are awful for any cup/mug that is sort of tall as it is under the front armrest.  The glove box is pretty much all you have aside from some small bins in the doors.  As mentioned, the backseat is cramped if you have people 5'9"" or taller in the front.  you will nto be taking 4 adults on a road trip in this car with or without luggage.  The gas tank for the AWD version is 11.9 gallons.  Not a deal breaker for me, but with my old Hondas and Hyundais I could typically get close to 400ish miles per fill up, its 300 on this one AND the low fuel indicator is out of whack (several owners report this).  The ""25 mile range"" comes on for me when i estimate I have almost 75 miles left, and it shows zero range left and I can fill up to see there is still almost 2 gallons in the tank.  I have asked Mazda at my local dealership about this and they just shrug.  Overall I recommend the car, with the biggest note being, make sure the space is right for your needs.",4

After 24 months and 12500 miles, there's so much to love about the CX3. The exterior / interior is always pleasant to look at and build quality is still very satisfying. All-whell drive system is very capable during snowy months. I-Activsense driving aids are helpful if not overly sensitive, especially the blind-spot monitor. Fuel economy is an average of 24.1 combined. Bose sound system could be better and navigation was updated once by the dealer for minor issue.

Sport mode really works well with paddle shifter, not recommended with normal drive ( eats more gas). I'm 6.1 so my right leg is always on counsel. That will be true with any small car. The LED headlights really are a help with backwoods driving ( able to spot dear easily ). Hit black ice once so far and worked awsome for traction. NEW UPDATE: 6 MONTHS IN ....We had quite a winter here in the CA high sierras and the car did great!!!! 140 miles a day in back highways. The AWD along with blizack tires did wounders!!!! Hands down beat a suberu for traction. So glad with our choice!!!!! Grand touring model is great. Led lights and smart cruise control on open highway is awesome. Thanks Mazda!!! Seems to be well made, time will only tell!! it's taken a beating so far at 25k in 6 months and know issues.  Ok SO IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS  AND NOTHING HAS FAILED!!!!! BLISSACK TIRES IN WINTER ( USED SMALLER RIM AND TALLER TIRE TO MATCH ORIGINAL SIZE ALSO THINNER TIRE, DOES BETTER IN SNOW)  LIKE A CHAMP, OF COURSE ONLY THING IS IF ROADS AREN'T PLOWED YOU WILL BE PLOWing SNOW A BIT, but we all know that it's not that high off the grownd.

It has good enough fuel economy that we can take it on trips, enough storage for all of our things and whatever we accumulate along the way, and plenty of safety and entertainment features to make us feel comfortable while on the road. Plus, I'm a pretty tall/stocky individual, and this vehicle has that SUV feel that allows me to actually feel like I'm not slouching or laying down to fit inside comfortably. Since the spouse drives a sedan, we needed something with a little cargo room for those bigger items like a grill, patio furniture, etc. This vehicle has just enough capacity for that kind of a trip as well. I test drove and checked out every vehicle in this class (Honda H-RV, Subaru Crosstrek, etc.) and for the price, I feel the decision to purchase this vehicle is a no-brainer.

3053, on 08/10/16 10:28 AM (PDT),redward ,2016 Mazda CX-3  Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),CX-3 -- what the reviews don't mention," The CX-3 Touring looks great in all the reviews -- the long snout , SUV styling, AWD, loud exhaust note, nice price, etc. But after driving one for 6 months, I find that it is loaded with badly executed features and controls that are a continuing source of irritation and discomfort. The long hoodline is eye-catching but it translates to a back seat that barely has room for a young teenager, much less for a tall adult, and the rear cargo area is minimal compared to my previous hatchback, a Hyundai Elantra GT hatchback. The GT was far superior to the CX-3 in roominess, interior styling, controls, handy features and lots of storage areas. The CX-3 has almost no functional front storage areas -- the cupholders are underneath a squeaky, creaky cheap plastic armrest, which is in the driver's way whether it's raised or lowered -- lots of fun to tackle when you're driving and you want a sip of your coffee. Nav system graphics features maps that are almost unusable -- road names, instead of being placed alongside or within each street they are featured in big white boxes with an arrow pointing to the street. In a crowded area, the screen is a mess of white boxes, obliterating any sense of where you are, floating aimlessly across the screen — totally amateur graphics unlike any I've ever seen. Mazda also gets demerits for being one of the few manufacturers that did NOT include Apple CarPlay software in the 2016 CX-3 which enables you to hook up an iPhone and use it through the audio system. Mazda software takes forever to boot up on starting, showing not even a simple clock until your journey is well underway. The accelerator is jumpy and gives jackrabbit starts, which hotshot reviewers seem to love, but in heavy bumper to bumper traffic, hair-trigger acceleration is an accident waiting to happen. The brakes are fine, but grab as you come to a stop -- making it seem like you've stopped too short. The interior is filled with cheap, low quality plastics that are noisy and flimsy -- sunglasses in the overhead holder rattle like crazy since there is no rubber cushioning to absorb the considerable road vibrations. Two deep cubbyholes in the front doors allow full access only if you get down on the floor and reach backwards to retrieve the objects that have rolled back there. The standard floor mats are made of thin, tacky spun material. Cabin noise levels on smooth surfaces and low speeds are acceptable, but increase rapidly on asphalt/gravel combination roads which are common in our area. Road noise combines with considerable wind noise at turnpike speeds to make music listening or conversation a chore. The controls for the audio system are located just UNDER the front of the armrest, requiring you twist your hand down and back in order to connect with them — a really stupid design. The cool sounding exhaust becomes a screeching bellow when you hit the gas for strong acceleration -- I suspect it may be artificially enhanced since the CX-3 is not a high performance vehicle. The automatic transmission is set up to downshift even on slow accelerations -- another attempt to add ""zoom zoom"" to your driving experience, like it or not. Stupid things like the windshield washers hitting low on the windshield, preventing the right 1/3 of the windshield from ever getting cleaned, leaving annoying streaks every time. Two dealers checked them and said there is no way to correct the aim, and checking other vehicles showed the same problem! The drivers’ side all weather rubber floor mat pops off the guide pins repeatedly, causing the mat to shift around and tangle with the pedals -- a potentially serious safety problem. Again, two dealers checked it and said ""Yup, the mat doesn't fit the pins."" A new set of mats showed the same problem since the pins, attached to the floor of my car, are off by almost ½ inch, causing the mat to spring loose. (Neither dealer offered any further action on these items.) The dashboard information is conveyed by intense white LEDs creating tiny lettering that is difficult to read while driving. The intensity control for lighting is a strange, raw metal post sticking straight out  of the dash that offers only too high or too low light levels. Most important information is displayed by tiny, sometimes incoherent icons that are difficult to read -- dozens of them, and their minuscule size escapes notice if you are not constantly scanning the blacked out icon area to see if anything has appeared there. None of these problems are game changers, but they add up to a car that seems like it was rushed into production without much checking to see how the ergonomics of the design worked out. The Hyundai GT had many more convenience features that were all nicely designed and rendered -- for instance, a smooth power roof compared to Mazda's cheap plastic manual slider with a glass roof panel that rises just an inch and produces too much wind noise. The Elantra GT was a lot more car for the same money.",3

Read head rests cover seat when down jutting out and making ride uncomfortable in back seat. When up, they block driver rear view sight and leave about a 18 in view space between head rests.

3055, on 06/11/16 18:30 PM (PDT),Angel ,2016 Mazda CX-3  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Love it!," I love my CX-3!  I bought it shortly after its debut when my Jetta TDI was totaled (not my fault).  So, I've owned it about 7+ months so far.  It is just fun to drive, and the added sensors and features really help out a lazy driver like myself.  The leather/suede seats are very comfortable for such a low-cost car, and although the CX-3 is more like a hatchback overall, the driver seating feels like an SUV.  I've gotten about 29.7 MPG average between highway and city overall, so about what was advertised.  I've been complimented many times about the look of the car by strangers and friends, but perhaps it's just because the car does look rather unique, at least compared to most cars driven around in the US.  Besides my concerns about how cheaply the car is actually made (see the next paragraph), my only major qualms are the ridiculously small interior and trunk and the lack of outlets/connectivity for the back seats.  I wanted a small vehicle, but I expected the CX-3 to at least be able to carry as much as a sedan.  My Jetta could hold significantly more luggage or whatever else (like 3 medium dogs comfortably).  The size and make-up of the interior just prevents transporting a lot of items - definitely not friendly for family vacations.  I'm thinking about getting a hitch installed or rails on the roof just to provide more options to carry.  And it seems silly for there not to be a fold-down armrest in the back seat with cup holders and a USB or AC/DC outlet.  Otherwise, my kids (4 & 14) enjoy the ""stadium"" seating, even the teenager.  Don't think you could fit three people back there though - pretty much impossible.But... about two months ago, I was stupid enough to back up into a pole in a parking lot (just wasn't paying attention), and the bumper and rear panels were damaged.  Unfortunately, the blind spot sensor was also damaged.  What I have learned from the repairs and the accident overall is that this car will not hold up in any sort of fender-bender.  Furthermore, while the repair shop was able to fix all but the blind spot sensor, the Mazda dealership took 3 weeks to fix the sensor (and did so incorrectly 3 times).  So, basically I was without my car for 3+ weeks because Mazda did not train its technicians on the new technology in their vehicles.  If there are any issues with the blindspot sensors, the bumper and rear fender flares must be removed and will probably be damaged (the dealership went through 2 bumpers and 2 sets of flares fixing the sensor).  I do worry about getting into an accident in the future and the car just buckling and crumbling, or that if any of the sensors are messed up that it will take a nightmare to fix them.  Most likely I will buy a vehicle next time with higher crash-test ratings (and at least pre-established US safety ratings).Update: It's been a year and I still love my car. I still get compliments on its sporty look, and I've had no recent problems.",5

3057, on 05/24/16 22:14 PM (PDT),SteveOakley ,2016 Mazda CX-3  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Fun and comfortable car," I've owned the car for about a month and so far I love it. The interior is the nicest I've ever owned. The car is surprisingly quick for only 146hp, and is much more fun to drive than the CX-5. The NHSTA safety scores were just released and it scored the highest 5 Star rating. It's one of those cars that looks more expensive than it is. It has a perfect balance of luxury and sporty fun to drive dynamics. The only cons are that the cargo space isn't the best if the back seats are up and in use, and the fuel tank capacity is too small for this car. I have too many trips to the gas station compared to previous cars I've owned. It really needs an additional 1 or 2 gallons more capacity and then it would be perfect. Overall, great car though.*Update: After owning the car for 7 months and racking up about 14k miles, I'm still enjoying the car and its been very reliable so far. The only issue is the navigation software has some issues every now and then, but that can be corrected by a future firmware upgrade. The other thing that can get annoying is the armrest/cup holder set up. This needs to be changed/upgraded in future models. --I recently had the opportunity to take a 6 hour road trip with my family of 4(including me) driving up the coast of California. The car handled everything well, especially a heavily rain storm we caught on the way up. The AWD was excellent. The car was so steady, with NO hydroplanning at all. I averaged about 33mpg highway miles on the trip. Again though, the biggest issues that needs to be addressed in future models is a larger gas tank. Just another gallon or 2 would be perfect, otherwise I've been getting less than 300 miles on a full tank. Don't get me wrong, no car is perfect, I still love the car and am glad I bought it. It's a great and unique looking car and fun to drive.",5

I test drove all the SUV style vehicles but really didn't want something so big. Also within my budget I always had to settle for the base model. Until I stumbled upon this gem! One of my biggest issues is I will NOT drive a CVT transmission.... I want to feel the shifting and almost all makers are trying to convert to this. But not Mazda! I was able to get the touring (mid level) with the moonroof and BOSE stereo system. The heated seats are amazing and the seat is extremely comfortable. The back seats are perfect size since I don't have passengers very often. The trunk isn't deep but the height is great. I think it is the same as my previous vehicle. I keep catching myself speeding in this fun to drive little Mazda! I have never felt so connected to the road.

I live in Minneapolis and had a great opportunity to try it out in the snow.  The all wheel drive is amazing.  I was able to plow though 6+ inches of snow up steep hills with no problem.

That day I drove 20 minutes from home to work, and when I entered to parking lot I was may be 15 miles an hour! After I made my 90 degree turn into parking stall with a very slow speed, I pushed the brake to fully stop! Car almost stopped but suddenly something extraordinary happened and car suddenly accelerated! I could not do anything! It stopped by hitting the snow bank and another car parked in another stall! Lots of damage on both cars! Luckily I was OK physically and there was nobody in the other car. As soon as I can, I called Mazda CEC, filed a claim and made the car towed to the dealership where I purchased it.Both dealership and Mazda engineer inspected the car,  they think there is anything wrong with the car however  there is NO explanation regarding how this sudden acceleration happened when data from car also tells that my feet was on brake during the incident!  I did lots of research, talked to lawyers who are very familiar with sudden unintended acceleration and found that there are similar cases, involving ""sudden unintended acceleration"" with many accidents involving bad injuries and sometimes death, but to the best I can figure out, it is difficult to prove causation by car malfunction. It leaves no trace and it is very hard to prove car has a problem. Even NHTSA did not find a vehicle-based cause of those incidents but some manufacturers still needed to pay millions of dollars to people who had sudden acceleration with their cars for their lost! Because it happens even though we don’t know why! Mazda CEC wants me to take the car back and drive it to replicate the incidents while all facts out there tells that sudden acceleration happens with unknown reason and kills people! Does Mazda really want me to prove with my life that this car has a defect?",2

Technology is great, although takes a little practise to master.  Sound system is also excellent.  Seats are very comfortable for me but might be narrow for a larger person.  No center console which is challenging for someone who kept mine full.  Not a lot of storage and small trunk.  No problem at all so far because the seats easily fold down.  I am happy to exchange this more limited space for a shorter body length and ease of city parking.Great car.  Recommend it highly.  The only annoying detail on the entire car is that you have to lift the armrest to access the drinks holder in the center.

3067, on 02/03/16 19:45 PM (PST),Kirk ,2016 Mazda CX-3  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),My Little Soul Red CX-3 (rest in pieces)," I wish I could post of picture my mangled CX-3 after someone decided to run a stop sign and plow into another car, when then plowed into me, destroying my 3 week old car.  I am 6'2"" so being able to walk away from that accident is a testament to the car's crash worthiness despite it's size and low weight.  Anywho, it is totaled and first thing I am doing is getting another one.  Not because it saved me from serious injury, but because it is a great car (I traded a 2014 Audi A4 to get it).  Pros:  Very comfortable front seats and suede-like inserts keep them from being so cold in the winter.  Speaking of which, the seat heaters are extremely toasty. I really like Mazda's entertainment system, but I just came out of an Audi whose MMI system is very similar.  Wife states Bluetooth sounds very good. I drive a lot for my job and was averaging slightly more than 30mpg which is pretty remarkable for an AWD vehicle.  Drove it briefly in this year's snow storm and it handled it fine.  Not nearly as well as my wife's Grand Cherokee, but well enough.  I love the size of this car, but it is likely too small for a family.  To call this car a crossover is kind of silly as a Ford Focus is bigger and the CX-3 has the same ground clearance as the Mazda3 sedan.  It handles well and is relatively quiet inside.  In that regard it is no Audi, but it is good for a sub-compact car.  I find it easy to get in and out of (much easier than the Audi) and ergonomics are spot on.  Simple layout of controls (trip odometer, tach, digital speed, HVAC system),  reminds me of cars 10-15 years ago when everything was so straightforward.  Cons: No center console storage and the arm rest blocks the cupholders.  Bose system is good, but not great.  Sub in trunk does not do much.  No SD card slot (except for Nav system). Two USB ports, but no where to hide the things you plug into them.  No standard front or rear parking sensors.  No power tailgate.  Absolutely tiny trunk.  Gas tank way too small.  I have to fill up every three days, which by the way only costs $17.No car is perfect, but for the money, this car is pretty darn good.  And throw in Mazda reliability, you got a home run.  I am looking forward to getting another one as soon as my other one is paid off by insurance.UPDATE:  Got my new CX-3 the week following the accident.  Exactly the same except for the color (Titanium Flash Mica).  Get lots of compliments about the car and the color.  Averaging about 30mpg now in the summer with the AC on.  Still love it, no issues except that it does have a little bit of trouble restarting once warm, no issues with cold start.  Motor Trend had noticed the same thing.  It always starts, just takes a second or two to crank.   Overall very happy.",5

3070, on 01/07/16 19:52 PM (PST),T ,2016 Mazda CX-3  Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),What it is --- and what its not," The CX-3 isn't for everyone, and I'm not sure whether it is properly classified or considered a ""crossover""---whatever that means.   I initially didn't give the CX-3 much thought because it is very compact.  However, if you look more closely, this car---a subcompact hatchback---offers a lot of features and value for the dollar (especially Touring trim) if you don't regularly  transport more than a couple of adults or much cargo.   Its not going to win many drag races, but it handles well and is more fun to drive than any of the other AWD vehicles that I test drove (including the CX-5).   It also isn't intended for off-road use (not many crossovers or SUVs are), but it has handled snow-packed dirt roads without any problems.   I'm getting about 29 mpg in mostly city driving to this point.   Again, the CX-3 isn't for everyone.  If you want/need an AWD vehicle but don't need much room or off-road capability, take a look at this car and judge it for what it is.",5

I love it!  It is the most fun to drive car that I have owned. (and over the years I have owned many).It is the most stylish sub compact SUV on the market, and the interior is upscale.  The Bose sounds great...and the array of safety tech features is awesome.The only consideration is limited back seat space.  Otherwise, a no brainer in comparison to its competitors....Especially if you love to drive.",5
3072, on 12/29/15 16:04 PM (PST),Connor McCollum ,2016 Mazda CX-3  Touring 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Still Enjoying Our CX-3!," My parents and I have now owned our 2016 Mazda CX-3 Touring for a year and seven months as of June 2018 and we couldn't be happier.  I've had my own car for a while now so I don't get to drive the Mazda as often as I used to.  However, there's nothing to complain about on the driving experience.  It is a very peppy, fun-to-drive car with good acceleration, great braking, and decent visibility despite having the typical thick airbag contained pillars.  I love the rear-view camera on the giant iPad-like infotainment screen.  It takes up the whole screen instead of being a puny little iPod size camera tucked in the center stack like a lot of cars.  Also, the blind spot monitor really helps in traffic and on the highway, although it is a little sensitive as it goes off every time when you're turning in a dual turn lane which catches you off guard.   Like I mentioned before, I love the simplistic interior layout with easy-to-use climate controls, steering wheel mounted controls, part digital and analog gauge cluster, round a/c vents, and the two-tone color scheme.  To me it's one of the best modern car interiors you can get on a strict budget.  It ain't no luxury car but it does feel pretty well-equipped for a sub-$20,000 compact crossover.It has had it's fair share of teething issues along the way like many all new models in the first year of production do.  For example, there was a major problem with the headlights leaking.  Everytime when it rains or you wash the car, the headlights would fill with water.  Eventually it dried but it risked blowing the headlight bulb and daytime running light bulb.  At first it was just the passenger-side and then it eventually spread to the driver-side.  They've been replaced since then and seal water just fine but an example of teething issues for an all new model.  In the summer of last year, we got a recall notice in the mail about the hatch struts.  It mentioned that they will corrode overtime and result in them falling on your head.  So we had to go to the dealer and get the struts replaced which work like a dime and are even a little thinner than the old ones.  The hatch also seems to open more easily and faster.Although teething issues are expected in many cars and I still enjoy the car regardless, I do wish it had a few more features that you can get without upgrading to the most expensive Grand Touring package such as LED headlights and daytime running lights, LED taillights, foglights, nicer wheels, and suede seat accents.  However, this will not stop me from dissing this car.  It's been a joy to own and drive for the last couple of years and we plan to hold on to it for even longer.  Hopefully Mazda will continue to make this car as I don't see a whole lot of them on the roads despite being released three years ago.",5
3073, on 12/27/15 17:48 PM (PST),Giuliano ,2016 Mazda CX-3  Grand Touring 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 6A),The perfect car.," I've had this car for three weeks and I love it, traded from a 2011 Mazda 3 Grand Touring Hatchback. The technology is amazing in this car. The power is great for a car in this class, it handles beautiful around the bends thanks with the help of the AWD system, paddle shifters and sport mode. The cargo space is a little small then expected, can't fit no more than three people, which doesn't bother me. They do need to make the gas tank bigger. 11.9 gallons is very small for a crossover with an AWD system. It should a 14 gallon tank. I get an average of 32 MPG. They also need to fix the heads up display. It will only display how fast you are going and the cruise control speed. In order for the navigation directions to show up, you need to add the i-active package which is another $2,500 bucks, and surpsingly enough, there's no power seats. Which is a bit of a downer. Other then that, its a great car.",5

I have had it for over 12,000 miles now, getting 24 MPG. The fold down seats do give you more cargo room. I really miss having a turbo engine.I was driving a manual transmission VW Beetle for 15 years, so I generally turn on the manual gear selection on this automatic. The paddle shifters work great except when you go around the corner when you must use the console shifter insteadHowever, if you need more rear cargo get the CX-5 or larger CX-7.Issues: The lane change warning indicator goes off for no reason quite often and is annoying; there is no way to turn it off! The touch screen cannot be used if the car of going over 5 miles per hour and you have to look down to see the knob and buttons (this to me is more dangerous than touching the screen).",4

3076, on 12/23/15 16:55 PM (PST),Dave Newberry ,2016 Mazda CX-3  Grand Touring 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Handles like a sports car," This is an amazing Sub SUV.  Handles like a sports car, safety and technology are amazing for the price point.  Fun to drive like nothing in the class. Interior materials match much more expensive vehicles.  The only drawback is the small interior space.  If you need space get the CX5.  My wife drives the 2015 CX5 and loves it.  But this CX3 is a kick to drive.  HUD is really cool.  Recommendation for Mazda, don't over complicate your technology.  There are more steps to switch, set up or navigate than necessary.  It is very intuitive, but feels like everything takes one or two steps more than are really necessary.  Obviously, this did not deter me as it is similar to the 2015 CX5 we have put over 45K and and love it still.    Loved this CX3.  Driven in rain, snow and dry pavement so far, amazing traction.    Well a year plus later, I still. Love this ride.  Great handling in the snow,  we have 4 AWD vehicles, this one is like other brands that wait for a slip before engaging AWD.  However, it works exactly as designed every time.  I live on a steep hill, with a steep uphill driveway to get to the road.  Without having to drive a beast or a German car, this is the perfect fit for us.  Nice Job Mazda!  2 Years later and a couple winters under my belt, I am still a fan of this little Compact SUV.  Everything I loved, I love more and the snow and ice traction are all I could have hoped for.  The interior is small, but this little beast handles like a Miata in the mountain roads.  Not for those who hall a lot of stuff or have regular backseat passengers. But for commuters in the Northeast who want some fun driving on winding roads.... I highly recommend the Mazda CX3. Another year and still enjoying the ride. This car is a bit small for a family but perfect for 1-2 people.  I added an OEM Roof Rails and Bars so I could handle ski's and occasional long item form the lumber yard.  Still a great looking vehicle and fun to drive like a sports car but with AWD for the snow and ice in CT.  Mazda lives up to Zoom Zoom with this car.  Make sure to update the tech on this.  It has had several versions of NAV/Infotainment updates.  Some early versions were quirky, but latest updates have made the entire experience very solid.",5

CX-3 appears exciting, safe, and incredible value.  I'm older and not as agile as I used to be, and I like my console space for coffee tank, phone, doodads to be handy on my long daily commutes.  I was hoping CX-3 would be  good fit, but awkward console placement and crampy ingress/egress (lower back issues) led to a 'pass' on this model.  If I was 20-40 and had a long commute however, I'd seriously consider this!  BTW, the Mazda 3 hatchback fit's me much better!",3

I saw the CX-3 on the road and loved the styling.  I started researching and read the really good reviews on Consumer Reports and other various you tube reviews.  I went and test drove the car and was not disappointed.  I had a Mazda 6 in the past and this car handles like a little sports car and is very fun to drive.  The acceleration is great, fit and finish are first rate.  I was disappointed that you could not get a power seat, but to be honest I have not missed it.The Bose System sounds great, the navigation, bluetooth and infotainment system are really easy to use.  There is a mute button instead of an on/off switch for the stereo so that also took some getting use to.  The gas milage is really good and even with it small fuel tank I am only filling up once a week.For a small car the ride is very good, it is firm, but that is what makes it such a great handling car.  Road noise is really good and even though the engine has a course sound to it, it sounds really sporty.  I choose Soul Red with Almond Leather interior, it is beautiful.Update: The Mazda CX-3 is a great car, I still love it now with 6700 miles.  It really handles well, has great acceleration for a small engine and looks very attractive.",5

It seems that you can almost think your way around corners. The car feels great on the road and is very responsive. The interior is very, very nice. The cabin is quiet (compared to the HRV and other similar cars I test drove) and has a very high quality feel. CONs: Cargo space is limited with the back seats up.

Technology was a no-brainer improvement over having none.  I personally hate all constant velocity transmissions (CVT) as I am old school.  This car would be more powerful with a decent 5 speed, but AWD requires the CVT, so AWD won out. Other than the CVT, this is a really innovative vehicle and we both love the back seat configurations for storage space.  If you want small, and you prefer to sit up higher than most sedans, this is the car.  The styling is sexy and sleek with off-road clearance.  The ""transformers"" looking, over-styled Toyota C-HR was just too bizarre looking.  The HR-V was well priced and sporty around town, but no passing gear AT ALL.",5

3086, on 08/29/18 12:04 PM (PDT),jodyk2 ,2018 Honda HR-V  EX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Compact SUV Feels Like a Car," I hadn't really planned on buying an SUV as I don't feel that, in a relatively flat state, it's particularly necessary. But, I was tired of not being able to see around the cars next to me at lights and stop signs, so I gave in. I didn't want anything too big, and I wanted it to feel like a car. My immediate previous car was a 2014 Chevrolet Sonic that I inherited, but before that, I had a 2009 Honda Fit. I LOVED the Fit. (The Sonic, not so much, except for the Bluetooth.) So, I was excited to see that Honda had a compact SUV; it felt like coming home. Unfortunately, they did not use 2 of the Fit features I really liked: the numerous cup holders (especially by the vents) and ample cabin storage. The HR-V has only 2 cup holders in the front (but bottle holders in the doors. Very odd.) and virtually no storage, except for a tiny space inside the arm rest. There are USB ports, but they are very awkwardly placed behind the gearshift -- which, for whatever reason, is up rather high. The other annoyances are that, in the non-navigational model, there is no compass. And, for some reason, they chose a dial for the speedometer, rather than digital numbers. The other thing I don't like is that, if you choose to leave the setting so you can see the mpg, you have to be on Trip A; you can't have that paired with the odometer. I also wish it came with lane/backup warning; there is a good backup camera, but it doesn't make a noise if something is in the way. Lane warning is not available on cars for the U.S. And, while I don't find the entertainment system particularly difficult, it is annoying that it ALWAYS displays the safety warning and then all the various choices each time you turn on the car, rather than defaulting to the last screen setting. It will play whatever you last had on, though. Onto good things: First, it came with Michelin tires. My dad was most impressed by that. It gets great mileage: I've consistently gotten 30 mpg in the city, and the rare times I've been on the highway, it's gotten up to 36 mpg. I also like the economy button feature: while some have complained that it makes the car feel sluggish, I don't find that to be the case, although I do turn it off when merging onto a highway, as it will give a little burst of energy. The seats are very comfortable. Shortly after I got the car, a friend and I took a 4 day road trip and neither of us was uncomfortable. The driver's seat adjusts up and down, as well as back & forward & sitting to more reclining. I rather like that the armrest slides, although if you move it up, you lose access to one of the cup holders.  The cup holders are also unique: you can adjust them to be deep for bottles or shallow for cups. There is also ample cargo area storage, and the seats fold into a variety of positions. And, not as important to others but it was to me, the HR-V is nice looking, with its shorter hood and rounded body style.  It feels roomy inside as well. All in all, I am pleased with my purchase. I feel confident in the car's reliability and safety, and I'm amused by its keyless entry and operation.",4

Only getting between 14-24 gas mileage. Only averaging 240 a tank.. a no go for a road trip. There is no driver storage for change, maps or umbrellas . The acceleration is minimal! Make sure you have plenty of time and space before making a move. I am so disappointed with this car. One of the worst mistakes in my car buying experience",3
3109, on 05/16/18 15:17 PM (PDT),Maggie ,2018 Mazda CX-3  Sport 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Just say to to CX3!!!," I’ve only had this car for six months and I dread driving the CX3 until it’s paid off. The gas mileage is pitiful. Averaging only 240-260 mpg on a full tank of gas. I’m planning a road trip soon and anticipating many, many more fuel stops. Now on to the acceleration. It is slow and sluggish. Make sure you have plenty of room and time if you want to pass anyone on the road. The CX3 has no cubbies for change, umbrellas or other miscellaneous items you keep in your car. My best advice, say NO!!",3
3110, on 05/11/18 21:46 PM (PDT),Jean Berko Gleason ,2018 Mazda CX-3  Grand Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),A Peppy Small Car with Some Quirks," The 2018 CX-3 (Grand Touring AWD) has comfortable, heated front seats and a heated steering wheel, and is reasonably zippy, given its small engine. Its safety features are also excellent, in particular its radar controlled cruise control.  It will maintain a constant distance between you and the car in front of you. Fuel economy is good and the gauges will tell you what  your average and current fuel consumption are.  On the down side, Mazda needs to hire some human factors engineers who will consider how actual drivers will deal with the impractical features dreamed up by the style guys.  First among them is the maddening rear hatch.  First, it has no inside release; worse yet, the only way to get it open is to feel around under the edge of the door for a flat little panel (one of two) that must be depressed.  Press the wrong one and you simply lock up the whole car. To find the right one you need to take off your gloves and feel around for it.  Forget having the kid at the market load your groceries for you.  The car also does not have Android Auto, or Apple Auto, so you are stuck with a clunky navigation system that won't respond to voice commands while you are driving.  I just use my Bluetooth phone and Google maps, but, of course they don't show on the Infotainment screen. I'm an extremely small person (about 5 feet tall) and I find the visibility quite poor: the rear window is too small; the outside mirrors are huge and block my view; the door and window pillars are thick; the side windows begin too high on the doors and are too small.  Sitting in the driver's seat, the hood is invisible to me--it's like driving a bus, but you have to remember that your bus has an invisible expanse of hood in front of it.  My final negative is that the fuel tank is tiny, giving the car a comparatively small driving range, even though gas mileage is good.  It's a good  looking little car, and has some great features, but since I find it hard to see out of it and have to fumble with the rear hatch a couple of times a day, I have mixed feelings.",4

3112, on 04/12/18 11:25 AM (PDT),johnha ,2018 Mazda CX-3  Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Just what we needed," This is a small SUV with Mazda's usual attention to everything.  We wanted something safe and reliable for our daughter to use mainly commuting.  The CX-3 doesn't pretend to be anything its not.  Storage space is minimal, but the competitive offerings weren't much different.  I was told that the rear seating space was lousy, but spent a couple hours back there on a recent drive (I'm 6') and was not uncomfortable.  I don't know that I would want to go cross country in the back seat though.  As usual with Mazda, the little SUV holds the road well.  Safety features that cost extra in some competitors are standard.",5

3114, on 02/22/18 11:40 AM (PST),Dave S. ,2018 Mazda CX-3  Touring 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl 6A),CX 3 Ideal For Me," It has a smooth, firm ride, and the steering is responsive. The CX 3 handles curves, corners, and turns extremely well. Cannot wait to take it on winding country roads and scenic drives when I travel far enough away from Chicago and suburbs. The compact SUV size makes this the perfect urban ride that can handle starts and stops. Very good burst when light goes green. This is a useful vehicle that can also be fun to drive for distances. Interior and dash design are awesome, IMO. Everything is within reach, and the center strip knobs below the gear shift make it easy to operate the stereo, the sound, the station, the XM channels, or any of the modes this 7-inch tablet style screen offers. Screen visibility is very good. Back up camera imaging is crystal clear. Blind spot and lane warning signals provided on side mirrors, with accompanying beep sound when other vehicles are getting close in other lanes. Stereo system is excellent, with  7-speaker Bose sound system. I purchased the AWD due to winter conditions that come and go here. But the CX 3 does not seem confined by this, as it drives and handles like a FWD in stable weather, while AWD kicks in when snow and ice are present. I am enjoying the CX 3 very much, and look forward to several more years owning this. BTW, the CX 3 boasts a sporty appearance, with smooth flowing sides, an elegant front, and well designed rear with easy hatch and dual exhausts.",5

Never liked the Crossovers much but this was different. The style is great and the features are what I expected for much more $$ in other brands. For a great run around car this is nirvana. 35+mpg so far, Bose sterio, safety features +++, phone, tablet friendly. Cruising around Vegas in traffic or 70+mph this car is awesome and a lot of Fun. Extremly responsive in city, and quiet on highway which I did not expect. Back seat and cargo are a bit small, but 99% of my driving is alone so no biggie for me. The lack of middle armrest is a bit weird but the center controller is awesome. If you are in the market for a Crossover, Do yourself a treat and give this car a test drive. For 26k you just cant beat it. Zoom Zoom",5

I traded my Scion XB and was interested in both the Rav 4 and the CH-r. Test drove both and was so impressed with the handling of the CH-r. I get very good gas mileage, 41 highway. The styling is not your typical small crossover and I get a great deal of compliments on it.  I have back problems and experience no fatigue on long trips because the seats are sooooo comfortable.",5

Perfect size for just me & occasional friends & bike/big item for the house, etc.  so I have cargo space but still like the single person I am vs I have 3 kids at home. Classy in a sporty way vs stuffy sedan. I can handle not having the latest features some other cars have for such a unique car for the price, but I just can't handle how gutless it is & gas mileage should be better. If 0 to 60 time, passing time, & gas mileage (& all other specs not too far off) was as good as the camry & honda accord for around the same price, I would definitely buy this.",3
3124, on 07/11/18 16:20 PM (PDT),Stewart Atwood ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Red ROCKET!," I was looking at all of the subcompact SUVs in it's class, and kept coming back to the C-hr. The styling was so difference from the others and I was stunned at how different the car looked from all sides. The appearance seemed to change as I walked around the car. I decided to take it for a test drive and I was HOOKED! This car has such a great ""race like"" suspension and incredibly nimble handling. It isn't a power house of an engine, but it gets up and goes, especially at freeway speeds..it is a little rocket! It fits me like a glove and I am 6'2"" in height. I originally was looking for a commuter car, since my truck was costing me too much in fuel, but found a car that is sporty, reliable, a blast to drive, and clearly out-paces the competition. Regardless of what some of the reviews are stating, some of which are clearly biased, or those conducting the ratings lack any real talent, this is a great car for anyone looking for great fuel economy and an exciting ride.",5

The space and cargo area is great for the vast majority of our purposes.  We were sold on the handling and ride quality.  We drive a lot on very curvy roads and highways that are in bad shape and were surprised at how stable the car feels.  Love the adaptive cruise control as standard equipment.  The car is slow to excelerate from a stop, but once it’s up to speed there’s no issue passing.  Bluetooth doesn’t synch quickly with my phone, so that’s the one annoying thing.  There’s a lag before it plays through the speakers.  The backup camera in the rearview mirror is a bit odd, but I’ve never had a camera before, so I do find it very useful.  I love the look and would choose it again.",4

It was so unique, I went home and looked it up on the Internet. When I saw the Radiant Green with the iceberg top option, I knew I had found my ""mid-life crisis"" car. I found one about 100 miles from my home and talked my reluctant husband into going to look at it in person. It did not disappoint! We made the purchase and 6 months later, I love it as much as when I first saw it. The sporty, yet elegant design is ingenious and the distinctive two-tone color scheme is so attractive that I get compliments on it everywhere I go! The interior is well-designed and very comfortable. It glides down the road with little effort. The handling is fantastic. I love the safety features and the convenience of the on-board computer/Bluetooth connection. My only regret is that it did not come with a built in GPS. Why, Toyota?",5
3129, on 04/22/18 09:14 AM (PDT),Richard ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),I bought it ..I like it," Yes it has a 4 cylinder engine. It is not a turbo, It does not pop your neck at acceleration. You want navagation...Get a portable Garmin that talks to you as your drive...can be updated on your computer for life for North America for free. Outside of that, this is a comfortable car, it has eye catching styling. You do have a blind spot on the sides, but if you know how to drive a car, you know how to use a rear view mirror and car outside mirror and use turn indicators to indicate lane switch. I first thought I would not like the review view camera in the mirror, but it really works because you should be looking at the rear view mirror also, and not looking down at a screen. The sensors are great. The interior fabric if taken care of properly will be no problem. I have owned some high dollar cars and some average. This is a car I like to drive...almost compares to my BMW for holding the road and curves. 18# tires make a big difference. You have a sport and Echo setting, which like a hybrid, require you learn to change your driving habits to get max performance. In short, it is a good value for the money and Toyota builds a good car. Go drive one and decide for yourself.",5
3130, on 04/09/18 13:57 PM (PDT),Kate ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),I dont really like this car, Would not recommend this car if your looking for gas saver car.

3132, on 03/11/18 11:14 AM (PDT),Michael White ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),A Flashy and Fun FWD Crossover," Had a chance to do an extended test drive of the Toyota C-HR and found it much better then many of the pundits have rated it. Overall its a very capable FWD crossover with great handling and comfort. I noticed no issues with acceleration and speed at all and found it right in line with any other compact car or SUV. I think the issue is many people see the styling and expect a race car experience when it's really a corolla in a different body. I drive a Mazda CX-3 AWD as my daily commuter and can say the C-HR definitely offers a more comfortable and stylish ride. The only knock I can put on the car is the terrible factory radio (easily replaced) and no hybrid or AWD version here in the US. I would expect both of these options will be added down the road which is why I'll probably wait to purchase one. Bottom line is if you are in the market for a smaller SUV and don't need AWD the C-HR should be one of the first vehicles you look into, it definitely does not disappoint.",4

3135, on 02/14/18 09:41 AM (PST),Y2Flu ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Love it so far," Purchased the radiant green base model. I like to be unique, flashy, eccentric, and flamboyant, and this color definitely stands out in a crowd. I had read some negative reviews regarding its lack of “get up” but I haven’t noticed it. Then again I’ve been driving a Sonata the past four years so I don’t have much to compare it to. The backup camera on the rear view mirror doesn’t bother me either. My only minor qualm is that I wish it had a CD player (I’m old-school) but I know that doesn’t match its modern-ness. Also wanted to note that I’m 6’3”/235 and I fit in it just fine with plenty of room to spare.",5

I went with my mother to purchase a Pirus for her, but she fell in love with the style, price, and comfort of the CHR and got the CHR.  After helping her program and operate certain things on it, I took a liking to it and decided to get one myself.  It’s a big step.  Not only is it my first Toyota, it is my first foreign vehicle.  So far it is already paying for itself with the difference in gas and insurance.  All the neutral ratings I put in were because I have not had it long enough, accept for the acceleration.  The acceleration is not impressive but not weak.  Consider however that this is compared to my Camaro. I rather have the acceleration stay as it is with the same price than have a turbo charged one for thousands more.  This vehicle is also uniquely designed.  Extremely original without a freakish look.  It is the most professional new look I have seen developed in a long time.",5

3139, on 12/29/17 14:00 PM (PST),Mel Mann ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Almost great," I found it interesting that the C-HR's I test drove early in the model introduction were under powered.  When it came time to buy 8 weeks later they were much better at acceleration.  The handling and breaking are great.  The body styling for the back seat door handles creates a large blind spot on the right side.  I do lengthy highway drives and use audio-books to keep me company; all 2018 Toyota's have discontinued having a CD drive in the entertainment system.  This may be great for a younger audience who lives their lives through a smart phone, but I miss the CD.  In so many ways the car exceeds my expectations, then in other ways I had not previously considered important...it is a frustration.",3

At 5’2” it is easy for me to enter and exit the car. The front seats are very comfortable (being a person who has had back surgeries) that is very important for lengthy trips. I also like the fact that the rear camera is located within the rear view mirror as that is the natural place your eyes 👀 go to when backing up. The voice controls are awesome so you don’t have to figet around when driving. Nice night detailing. When you open the door Toyota CHR illuminates on the ground which gives it a classy feel. The ride is very comfortable and the safety features are amazing. I have only had my C-HR for a month and I really like it. It not too big or to small it’s just right.,5

Wish it had satellite radio, Cd Player and had a backup camera not in the mirror. The only thing you must be careful of is when pulling into a space it is easy to scrape the front low bumper. Wish it had a front camera for parking. But overall I love my CH-R. When I drive down the street I see heads turning to look at it. And when I park it people come over to ask about the car. They call it very snazzy looking. I was going to get the Nissan Juke until I heard it takes premium gas. Glad I did not get it as I love my CH-R better. For some reason the glass is hard to keep streaks off of it after cleaning. That is my only complaint. Are they using inferior glass?",5
3145, on 11/20/17 08:10 AM (PST),SWH ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Not so big and not too small," Yes, I've read the knocks on the acceleration, I had a V6 Cadillac, but truthfully where can you drive that fast any more?  The speed is perfectly adequate and may be the only downside to the car. The blind spots are thoroughly taken care of by the Blind Spot Detection.  I think it may be the safest car I've ever owned.  I drive it on the turnpike every day and acceleration once you are up to speed isn't an issue - you only see it when you try to accelerate from a stop.  The ride is close to my old Cadillac - it probably would be spot on with beefier tires, but it wouldn't look so great.  Steering is terrific. I love the rear view camera in the rear view mirror, makes total sense and is one of the reasons I bought the car.  I have the blue with white top so it's hard to find a cuter car.  Surprisingly my 6' husband has no issue with getting in and out or sitting comfortably - up higher than sedans.  The bluetooth is awesome but did miss XM radio so had it installed and it really should have a button to open your garage door.  It would also be super cool if your apps would show up on the big touch screen then I could see Waze better.  I would like to see it have 4 wheel drive, but that's going to increase the price a lot. I bought the car in October and its June now - and I would still say that I absolutely love this car.  Haven't had a problem, it's absolutely perfect.",5

I was blown away the first time I saw this in a parking lot. I love that it looks like a 2 door. Felt like it would be above my price and was happy to find it affordable for a beautiful new car. I test drove it and then walked away for a week. Went and drove a Subaru Crosstrek, Nissan Rogue Sport and Mazda 3 then went back to the CHR. I smiled and laughed the whole time I was driving this car. So much more fun then the others. Handles great, speedy and sporty. I have had so many comments that it looks like a car from the future or a spaceship. I love that, couldn't stand the thought of a boring sedan. I took a risk and went for the red, I had the windows tinted and it looks hot! No worries about it being a new model since it is a Toyota. Dealership was wonderful and made the sale a pleasure. Hope to have it for a long time. The only down side is the small back windows do create more of a blindspot than I am used to and if I had children in the back seat I don't think they would be able to see out. But since I don't have kids it is not an issue for me.",5
3149, on 10/01/17 13:40 PM (PDT),Janet Cunningham ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Great value and safety features, I really like this car! I am a single very small woman and I just leave the back seats folded. I have read that they have limited vision for passengers. My dealer is wonderful and the first 25000 miles of service is included. I am very happy with the standard safety features.,5
3150, on 09/18/17 15:23 PM (PDT),George ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Great little car, Before I purchased read all the reviews (europe) included. Front legroom is great unless you're a basketball player as well as rear legroom. Used to own a 5.7L hemi V8 and while the power is obviously less in the sport mode it's still pretty peppy. If you want a good radio/nav system you'll have to go aftermarket like I did and put the rearview camera through that screen and not use the rear view mirror screen (sometimes too much reflection). Love the safety features and the styling. Good gas mileage and plenty of power entering the highway and passing. Want better gas mileage use the economy mode.,4
3151, on 09/04/17 08:57 AM (PDT),Anthony Sanseverino ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Zips Right Along," After reading a couple of other reviews that said acceleration (especially to Highway speeds) was poor, I was quite apprehensive about leasing/purchasing this vehicle. But, after a test drive that allowed me to accelerate quickly, and get on the freeway, I've come to the conclusion that those other reviewers must be use to V-6, or V-8 power. Or, they aren't use to the smoothness of the CVT. As someone who transitioned from a 4-cylinder 2005 Toyota RAV-4 to the 2018 C-HR, I believe that the acceleration is quite adequate. And, a couple of times, I've had my head pushed back against the head-restraint. While I'm not one who needs a Navigation system to show me where to go, the Bluetooth connection for my cell phone (though, I don't use it often) is a great thing to have. Now, I've only had the car for a little over a week, but so far, it's been AWESOME! And, if the on-board computer is to be believed, the MPG on each trip has ranged from very good to absolutely fantastic (ranges between 22.6 to 40.8). While the SmartKey system took a bit of getting use (I've been turning a key for over 40 years :) ), it's a great feature. My only complaints are: the base model should also be equipped with the BSM system, RCTA and Backup camera; considering the sportiness of the car, dual-exhaust would have been neat (luckily, I can buy (and have bought) bolt-on dual-exhaust tips; and a choice of interior colors (I love the exterior Metallic Silver Knockout, but the black interior gets hot during the summer months in Phoenix, AZ).",5
3152, on 08/30/17 06:28 AM (PDT),Mitchell ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),HR-V is far Superior," Test drove the C-HR and was completely underwhelmed - specifically with the power train, driving dynamics, and tech. Engine is completely uninspiring and the CVT technology seems like it is from 2010. I would not trust safely passing anyone in this car on a two lane road. Steering feel is numb and light, which I expected for a Toyota. Handling was OK, the car felt somewhat secure going around turns when trying to drive with some gusto (very difficult to do that due to the weak powertrain). No Carplay or Android auto is unacceptable for a 2018 model and onboard infotainment is nothing to write home about. Truly a shame because the exterior styling of the car is attractive! I test drove a Honda HR-V after this and found that it is a superior car in every category - I ended up purchasing it later that day! My opinion - don't buy this car until you test drive an HR-V.",2
3153, on 08/15/17 08:05 AM (PDT),Win ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Solid vehicle," We purchase this vehicle two months ago... Smooth ride and very comfortable seats for long rides.  Gas mileage is great, average over  38 mpg on the highway. Car is not a speed demon, nor does it has all the bells and whistles, but it does have great safety features.",5
3154, on 07/30/17 00:07 AM (PDT),Marc ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),"Interesting looking; lacks power, small interior"," We liked the exterior looks of this car, but lack of power and small interior made this is no-go for us.  The front passenger seating required that knees practically be touching the dashboard.  I floored it at a green light, and no one could tell - it just gently accelerated up to speed - I would hate to think about trying to pass someone on the freeway or going up a steep hill.  Blind spots due to large pillars to the left and right of rear window, but Toyota Safety Sense standard is nice, though this car has the pared-down version for smaller vehicles, not the full-featured version like the RAV4, Camry, etc.  We wound up purchasing a RAV4 instead - more power, more room, more features, etc.  But don't expect to use Toyota's telenav through your smartphone - it's worse than using a printed out map - my 2002 Lexus GPS ran circles around it.  Come on Toyota, admit your mistake, dump telenav, and go with Android Auto and Apple Car Play like everyone else has figured out, or do you want to lose hundreds of thousands of car sales?",2
3155, on 07/06/17 19:20 PM (PDT),J. Short ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),LOVING MY C-HR!," This is odd, but my husband and I have also been loyal Jeep owners.  We have owned Jeeps- everything from the new Cherokee, to Grand Cherokee (and still have a Wrangler) for the past 30+ years.  I wanted a small crossover, and decided to go outside the Jeep family only after I first laid eyes on the CHR.  I absolutely fell in love with the styling.  At first glance I truly thought I would not be able to afford it, but was pleasantly surprised by the price tag.   I have owned it for just over 2 weeks and really love the way it handles.  Being used to the lower gear ratio of the Wrangler, the CHR feels like a speed demon.  I would love to see this vehicle with a sun roof and navigation... I am hoping that they come out with these options.  This is an awesome vehicle and I hope to be driving it for years to come!",5
3156, on 07/05/17 08:35 AM (PDT),BAS ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Hot Little SUV," We were looking to replace wife's 2010 Ford Edge Ltd. (loved the car- Ext warranty run out)  We decided not to go back to Ford as the Edge has design and structural flaws in the newer model. (first had experience through Sister-in-law - Ford could not fix) We looked at and test drove VW, Jeep, and did not like the looks of Mazda, Nissan, Chevy, and did not want the high-end models, BMW, Porsche, Jag.  I had seen the Ch-R in reviews - So I suggested Toyota - WHAT? We have never owned a Toyota, Drove the Rav 4 (edge like and size) drove the 86 (too small) Drove the CH-R. Wife loved it (5'-2"") sporty 2 door look with 4 doors, hatchback, good gas mileage, and I (6'-1"") rode in the back seat without too many problems, comfy even.  BUT - only comes in two trim level with virtually no extras. NO NAV - can't get it in the CH-R, Cloth Seats. BUT - Toyota dealer customized the car with two tone Leather (like the Rav 4) and Remote Start. Wife loves the car, Small, (easy to drive and park) Sporty (great design look) and Priced right (under 26000) We look forward to many years with this car.",4
3157, on 06/21/17 18:56 PM (PDT),Amy ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Very nice all around!, Great looking car! Ive owned it for almost 2 months now and have not one regret of my purchase. Great handling and the style inside and out will fit right in to the future cars. First reveiwer claims it has poor resale value... how would you know since this is the first model ever that had just been released? Toyota has great reliability which is key to a loyal long term customer.,5
3158, on 06/20/17 16:42 PM (PDT),Tim ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Great Purchase," I just purchased a C-HR premium and could not be happier.  It wil be used mainly in the city and the amount of safety features was well worth the money.  Great styling and very co for table interior.  Acceleration could be better than however, works perfect for our use.",5
3159, on 06/17/17 15:14 PM (PDT),CindyK. ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Search if over," We are a jeep family (26 years) & I wanted nothing but a jeep. Searched for 9 months built them online, test drove & almost purchased. I'm a mom who is the onlyone in the vehicle at most times so I wanted a smaller SUV.  But when i saw this C-HR I fell in love! I wanted a the SUV feel & the small size of a car.  Didnt want to have to jump in or crawl out & the C-HR is just that, perfect, compact, right height of getting in & out of the vehicle.  Still have the feel of SUV by putting the seats down & carry what I need at any time. Love the way the seat just wrap around me & sit so comfortable.  Dash is at the perfect angle where the driver can see & do if needed, since the controls are on the steering wheel you just need to glance at it.  I would love the remote start, the rain guards for my doors & navigation BUT to know I'm not paying for the ""JEEP"" name & getting a great vehicle, is a relief.",5
3160, on 05/05/17 15:33 PM (PDT),Carl ,2018 Toyota C-HR  XLE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Not for me," The CHR is just ""meh"" Test drove one at an Indy dealership, bought a Honda HRV EX instead, more interior room, more cargo space, more extras at a lower cost. Also better resale value.",2
