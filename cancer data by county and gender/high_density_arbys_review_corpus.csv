"i have been coming to this place since i was in middle school. i remember getting curly fries after 3pm and thinking i was the coolest kid on the block. fast forward 12+ years later, i still love their curly fries and the horsey sauce is still as good as i remember it. i ordered the chicken salad sandwich last night and it was the perfect amount of chicken to mayo ratio. it was laced with sweet grapes as well so the contrast was a win. i don't come here as often as i do, but i take my kids here as a treat and it becomes a bit of nostalgia for me."
"the idea was floated of getting off the highway in an effort to eat at an arbys, when i previously offered to pay for a fabulous burger at my local watering hole, oddly, struck down for arbys.the idea floater, a self professed fast food connoisseur got his wish and peeling off the drive from hell, in we went.very intetesting architectural design with a fifties design, decour and audio play - little bitty pretty one - similar to the diners from back then that are now becomming as extinct as a t-rex.loading up on my tabled sauces, i pulled the smokehouse brisket from its undersized cardboard home with a pancake like flip of the wrist. as i supped, i examined the meat as it had the ring of smoke induction within and manifested itself in the flavor.as i try too steer clear of any and all fast food, this sammy was a winner. arbys isn't just roast beef anymore folks, and try the horsey radish sauce on the curley fries!!"
been to this arby's plenty of times. the food is average sometimes service is good. sometimes not so much. they do have their own private parking lot. so it's very easy to park your car. they have a drive thru too.
decent sandwiches. service not as good as sandwiches. any pork sandwich is worth the wait. prices a a bit high but sandwiches are fresh.
"very average place here. the store needs to be kept clean as i have seen it messy and the tables being sticky. can't really expect much from fast food spots but i still end up coming because i'd be in the mood for the roast beef sandwich and other heart clogging items such as the fully loaded curly fries, divine. i do however love the fact they gave a square post card looking thing that has coupons for your next visit. go get your arby's fix and get out."
instant yelp. havent had arbys in years. roast beef double was very good. curly fries nice . mozzarella sticks good. drink accompanying. priced at about $12. good taste and quality . mightve upgraded over the years idk but i am going to have it again. i don't typically eat fast food. except for mmmmmm chick fil a lol arby's is a good second option and better option than the other fast food places.
i'm a vegetarian but i was craving some arby's the other night...for the fries lol.i always get the same thing. the loaded curly fries (minus the bacon). the fries are yummy and so filling. no matter how full i get i always have room for the jamoca milk shake. definitely a must have. although i don't come here often because i try to eat healthy but this place is great and the service is always quick and easy.
"very good burgers!i came on a wednesday late night and ordered the crispy chicken burger & cookie butter shake. i did not like the cookie butter shake at all, because it has a gingerbread-ish taste to it. i like that flavor in cookies, but not in a drink. the crispy chicken burger was really tasty and quite hefty. i don't understand why people opt for other fast food burger chains when arby's has really good full burgers. they also have quite a variety of sauces you can take. in conclusion, i'd definitely pop in again if i'm hungry for fast food or just to casually grab cheap food with a friend."
"after seeing so many arby's commercials on tv.. ""arby's! we have the meats!"" my co-workers in long island are frequently raving about good fast food there. so i figure..why not..i'll give it a try. after all, there's one conveniently located in fresh meadows. one morning, i decide to make the trip before work. drive in to the small-ish parking lot. walk in and the place is quite busy. a mixture of kids from nearby francis lewis high school and other patrons. they have a pretty large menu: angus steak, corn beef, roast beef, brisket, ham, chopped salads, chicken, fish, turkey, curly fries, etc. i tried the reuben corn beef on marbled rye bread. it tasted pretty good. i would definitely get it again. i also saw a video a few months ago about how arby's roast beef is made.. supposedly they are shipped to the arby's location in liquid form and then cooked into a solid.. i included a link to the youtube video below. youtube.com/watch?v=zshd…"
"after burning some calories for black friday shopping, the broski and i were craving arbys today. arby's is definitely an upgrade from mcdonald's and those other fast food chain restaurants. what makes arby's delicious is their curly fries, onion rings, cheese sticks (with a great amount of mozarella deep fried with love!), and the best, most sweetest, tastiest, juiciest,  hot in your mouth-watch-out-for-your-tongue-becuse its -piping hott: jalapeno bites! it was love at first bite when i devoured these into my hungry belly! lol i only know of arby's that sells these amazing little fried pieces of goodness! it does come with a bronco berry sauce, which actually is not necessary b/c the bites taste better w/o any sauce! but it's not bad either.-another favorite of mine is their green iced tea which is a sweet thirst quencher,summer, winter, fall or spring! it's sweet, but not too sweet, right amount of sugar, ice and green tea,what an amazing combination!-today my brother ordered the jalapeño slider, signature smokehouse brisket sandwich combo and an cinnamon apple crisp for dessert. everything he ordered tasted fresh, was hot and delicious.-i ordered the buttermilk crispy chicken and it was crunchy, little spicy (but not spicy enough!) and had shredded lettuce with this great white sauce and tomatoes.it's great to eat this unhealthy fast food once in a while! your tummy will thank you and you can hot the gym later! -lol-"
this was my first time ordering arby's. my friend suggested it since she's a regular. the guy taking my order was very patient due to the fact that i was so indecisive and didn't know what to get. he made my first experience a good one.i ordered the bacon chicken burger and curly fries. the burger was very delicious and the meat/chicken was well seasoned. i loved the effect of the bacon on the sand which.the fries were very delicious and crunchy. so full of flavor. i definitely want to come back and try other things from the menu over a period of time. where have you been all my life arby's?
"its arbys, what can you say....its arbys. i was just wanting a little bit of the good ole days when the arbys had that big hat sign out front with all the lights around it. oh those long gone days where the arbys sauce and the horsey sauce were in bottles not little packets. it was a share night with a coupon, so we split the special deal of two small roast beef, two fries and two drinks. the roast beef was whatever it was, mystery salty meat, the fries were hot and curly, but the drinks were messed up. something was seriously wrong with the soda machine. not enough syrup for the carbonated water. i mentioned this to one of the employees and he looked at me like i had 3 eyes and a 4 noses. i just tossed the drink. g was still hungry so he went and purchased the corned beef slider. he said it was awful. i said, go put some horsey sauce on it. he went on the adventure of the arbys looking for mustard, but settled for the horsey sauce. g said the bun with the horsey sauce would have been better than the corned beef. hey, what do you expect, this is arbys not katz's deli. i would say my wish for nostalgia was not fulfilled. 2 stars for small sandwiches and bad drink machines. the hot curly fries brought the score up from 1 star."
"the last two times we came, this location redeemed itself after our original snafus.  sure they still get my beef and cheddar order wrong but it's fresh and they fix it quickly.  it also seems there is a new staff (desperately needed) that are friendlier and efficient."
"service was fast. the food was made fast and not sloppily. it actually looked like the picture for once. the employee wasn't the friendliest, but he did his job efficiently."
i love arby's. crazy because i haven't been in a while simply because i haven't had the taste for it but i do plan on visiting soon. preferably this location. they are always nice and courteous. no problems from me at this location.
it's gross here! don't go! food tasted like oil from 3 weeks ago and so stale! i thought i was chewing on old oily gum. i cant believe they sold me this! no stars if could!
"excellent experience, food and dessert was delicous and the entire place is clean and new even the bathrooms. i live about 5 miles away but it was worth the trip and will definitally be back. staff was very friendly especially the kid that took our order ramel was patient and helpful. would definitally reccomend."
i have been here a bunch of times and their food is always fresh. i have had no problems with them. it is always a plus when you have a soda fountain for free refills. this place gets a bit crowded when the kids are let out of school.
"while i like the arby's markey fresh sandwiches i am about to go on a rant about a new item i just saw on the menu. gyro's? noooo! oh no you didn't!one does not simply put deli meat on a pita bread and call it a gyro. this is not a real gyro. i am not even greek but i am offended on behalf of all greek people everywhere!aside from that the chicken sandwiches aren't too bad but those and the turkey is all i will ever eat here. the rest of the meats look super processed and unappetizing. what is cool is the fact that i am always getting bogo coupons in the mail from them. those pretty much run you a little over 5 dollars for two sandwiches which is great for a inexpensive meal on the go. the horsey sauce is the bomb, i put it on everything! not really a fan of the curly fries. the shakes are bad ass when they have a promotion good flavor. the last time i went all they had was orange cream which i'd imagine is pretty gross. the salted caramel shake needs to make a comeback, i could drink myself sick on those. free refills on the drinks, plenty of sauces available to go around. before and after school hours you can find this place mobbed with francis lewis high school kids hanging out but on the weekends it's not so bad and the drive through moves pretty quickly."
"remember, this is fast food. with that being said, it's probably the best fast food out there at this price point.reuben - awesome sauce brings a solid sandwich togetherroast beef max - here's your three meals for the day in one. meat stacked up miles high. not particularly tasty, but a good way to fill up for a day or twenty. rip sodium for the day though.roast beef classic - a size mortals can probably manage. not my favorite flavor, but you get a lot of food for the price.turkey - really quite plain, won't order again.gyros - some of the more solid options here, these are good!curly fries are some of the best aroundthe shakes they have are tasty, but a bit too sweet for me.try their arby's special sauce on your sandwich or fries, it's pretty good! same for the triply spice, though it's not particularly spicy by any means."
"after a day of shopping, nice to cool off my jets and grab a couple of sandwiches to go.usually do not get fast food as much because someone in the family has hypertension, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, etc... so, what are your choices? more healthier selection without all those yummy condiments or dressing. so a naked arby's roast beef sandwich will do when you are outside and not home cooking healthy meals.delicious thinly sliced roast beef without any cheese. with the fish sandwich, asked for no dressing and hold the mayo. this time around you get better bargains with the promotions advertised and posted on their windows. two sandwiches for only $5 dollars is a much better deal than the circulars with the coupons. will be back again in the near future. this arby's is clean and spacious. staff is friendly and double check your order before they give you the bag of goodies."
"we have been to this location many times and the food is usually edible in the least, and pretty decent at its best.  but the service is always something other that stellar.  this particular evening, we should have stayed away, as they almost sent me to the hospital.  the dark drive thru should have been an omen, but we were too tired to go inside to order.  we drove in a pitch black drive thru and a surprised voice came through the speaker box.  we placed our order and the guy asked us whether we wanted the special and we inquired what it was, the response was like its the beef and cheddar 2 for blah blah blah.  mind you we ordered beef and cheddars with no red sauce, only cheese and beef (verbatim since they have made errors in the past). we were given a total and drove around very carefully.we paid, waited and got our food.  as we drove down the street a took a bite of my sandwich and my tongue started feeling scratchy and numb as if i burned it.  as i chewed, there were hard little pieces of something in the food.  i opened the sandwich and saw there was two skinny pieces of dried up bacon in the sandwich!  i am allergic to pork!  we did a u-turn and i took them back inside. the window guy saw me and tried to hide away. within that few minutes of me being there, i started feeling very ill.  the manager finally came over to me and i explained the situation (allergies, etc) and requested a benadryl (she said she didn't have anything but a first aid kit?).  instead of them apologizing, i was asked for my receipt and this little boy came and attempted to tell me what i said!  when i refuted and put him in his place, i excused myself to the restroom because the bite of food had taken its toll.  i guess she thought i was kidding because this manager had the nerve to opened the bathroom door and saw me hunched over the commode heaving and expelling my insides.  i came out got the remade sands and let the manager and the ill-mannered boy that the way this was handled was quite disrespectful, lacked in customer service and responsibility on their part.  the parting words from this woman? make sure you check your food before you leave and sorry you got sick.  my words for the gm to this location is to fix the lights in the lot and on the menu board, its a safety hazard.  train your employees to be responsible, professional and attentive to the customer's actual orders, not what they would eat themselves.  i will drive across queens, go to li or even to manhattan where the employees value their customers and their health. my bf got me some benadryl thank god, but i lost my voice and regular taste buds for 3 days.  thanks a lot arby's."
"the former home of the fast food roast beef sandwich, i was a bit taken off guard with all of the meat options.there is turkey, corned beef, steak, roast beef, a bacon sandwich, nd i'm probably leaving a few meats out. because i have zero self control when hungry, i ordered two three cheese and steak sandwiches and curly fries, as one sandwich would suffice.its peppery outer layer was nicely noticable beneath the swiss cheese, cheddar and gouda giving this sandwich a decadent cheesy flavor.the meat is apparently from angus cattle, not so sure about that, but i'm not here to confirm nor deny it's origins, it's just darn good."
they've got the meat! who doesn't love arby's? they have great sliders which provide variety at a reasonable price in case you do not know what you want and do not want to commit to a big meat sandwich. they also have creative sauces to dip your sandwiches. if i'm ever in the area i try to stop by because there are not too many arby's  around.
this arby's is great! always clean fast and efficient. i saw the manager getting his hands dirty by wiping the glass doors himself. that's definitely a good sign. the food is made to order unlike other fast food joints that have some sitting on the counter.
it's a fast food place. can't really get more  than 3 stars. order took long. i don't know maybe that day i went it was a hot mess. but try the fries! give them try they're actually one of my favorite fast food fries! their sliders are also good for $1.50ea you can't ask for anything more than a well made sandwich!
"nothing extra special..i just ordered the smokehouse brisket sandwich meal. it tasted good and everything seem fresh. the curly fries were got and crispy. the sandwich had brisket, cheese, small little onion rings and barbeque sauce."
"always loved arby's, what i didnt like is how long it took them. and i cant say that there were many people waiting. they kind of missed the idea of fast food and the fact that when i come to arby's is when i want the food to be ready asap."
discontinued most of standard sandwiches such as jr. roast beef and ham & cheddar because ic so called bread issues. replaced with skimpy sliders to make us buy more just to satisfy hunger. they now have over 20 choices that no one wants.order taker consistently getting orders incorrect management sarcastic and rude .only reason to go there is if you can't find any other place open to eat !!!
"love this place. great service today. no complaints from arby's. i went in because i heard of an item off of their secret menu called the meat mountain sandwich that contains all of their selling meats as well as a slice of swiss and cheddar on a bun. (roast beef, turkey, ham, corn beef, brisket, as well as chicken tenders.) all for a whopping $10 but well worth it. i was only able to eat a little over half of the sandwich. a+++"
"very much hit-or-miss. you either get great staff members or huh-is-anyone-paying-attention-today? but, the food is usually good & it's clean. i was annoyed the other day when i ordered a milkshake & was automatically given the largest size. if i had realized there were several sizes, i would have ordered the smallest. that was a bit shady.if you think arby's is more healthful or lower in fat, salt or calories, i would recommend you choose very carefully, using the published nutritional information. i learned the hard way that the ""healthful"" sandwich i was ordering was completely blowing my diet!they have a parking lot - woot!"
"i use to love going to arby's just for the basic beef and cheddar sandwich. the last two times i have gone to this location it has been the worst i ever had. i when april 11, 2018 and last year, since once in a while i go to bj wholesale near by.  the bread tasted old, the beef was cold and looked weird and cheese was barely any.  now i paid 4.25 for a horrible sandwich. the jalapeno poppers were great that is about the only thing  i will ever buy at this location.  food has been terrible both times in the last year. sorry but the truth is the truth, i wonder why most arby's have closed good luck getting my business"
"the special right now is two french dip & swiss for $6!add a large order of curly fries and a shake i have a full dinner for two.their take on the ""philly"" sandwich is good also.tip- the dining area is spacious with nice decor.the parking lot is very small. left turns out of their parking lot is a challenge because of the high traffic on metropolitan ave."
i told the girl i would like a chicken slider with cheese .plain no sauce. she asks me just cheese and bread? i said yesshe hands me just cheese and bread no chickenumm what??i go back to her and she is like u said cheese amd bread. i said i ordered a chicken slider why wouldnt i want the chicken??she rolled her eyes like i didnt make sensethen she gives me a chicken slider with no cheese. unbelievable
their steak sandwich the # 8 (triple cheese) is very good. that is my go-to food whenever i order from there but the only thing i dont like is the fact that only 1 out of the 3 or 4 cash registers is open. the service is very slow as a result but if you dont mind the wait its okay because the food i always ordered came on point every single time. delicious!!! oh and the curly fries is banging!!!
"food was very fresh, hot, and delicious. the restaurant and bathroom were both very clean. employees were all polite and in proper uniform. my only complaint was they couldn't accept my arbys gift card because the ""gift card system?? wasn't working. i was given this gift card as a present and drove from brooklyn to use it. i hope they'll be able to accept my gift card if i return. overall i was satisfied. i'll return in a week and give an update."
"slow as molasses.   i order 3 simple t hints. cookies ,coffee and an apple turn over.  it took 20 minutes to get it. i was falling asleep."
"fast food is not my cup of tea per se, but occasionally i do venture to arby's where not easily accessible in new york city for the difficulty to locate. after departing from an appointment that was well received only to be mere feet of distance on metropolitan avenue to be electrocuted by eye witnessing electricity dangerously spewing from a live wire of a utility line, i quickly sought the nearest indoor shelter for substance. disappointingly from memory arby's had the most flavorable chicken cordon bleu sandwich, which has been discontinued. i do love their very mild spicy curly french fries and their market fresh turkey wrap. service is efficient and attentive for clients to be reference by first name basis in a fast food restaurant is unknown for this arby's #7737.  facilities is full operational and clean with a airplane style lock ""vacant"" or ""occupied"" indicator on outside of door.  there is a captain's bell bell (originated by long john's silver who arby's later copied in their franchise chain) to be rang upon exiting for clients to loudly voice their appreciation of a good experience, which is much better than standard written comment cards to be easily lost or never reaching its final destination to the corporate headquarters lair."
"three cheese & bacon w/ curly fries.pretty decent and tasty compared to arby's other bland tasting sandwiches. the curly fries kinda sucked that day. cold and soggy. one of the main reasons why i like arbys is their curly fries w/ their horsey sauce.as for this location, i like it better than the one that's along horace harding near utopia parkway. it's less crowded here but the parking lot is quite small. the interior is identical to the one on horace harding. i usually stop by this arby's when i'm coming out of bj's at metro mall. it's better than the burger king in metro mall in my opinion. that burger king in that mall could never get your order right."
they act like they don't wanna work. seems like it every time my husband asked for something they did it but didn't seem like they wanted to. seems like their being bothered wen asked for something. they charged 54 cents for a cup of cheese and it wasn't even filled all the way. stop having teenagers run the place
they always take my coupons.sandwiches and fries are filling.fast staff.
"forgot half our order, forgot to give me my cup when i ordered too. when i collected my food i noticed half was missing so had to go back in line and ask:a) where my cup was and b) where the rest of my order was. the employee seriously looked like she couldn't give a flying s*** about this or even being there to be honest and i had to re order and pay for the things she missed. to top off our already crappy encounter, the extra order took 20 mins and our food was cold. disgusting"
"i went in and there wasn't much of a long line but they were taking forever with orders. as i'm leaving the line and heading out, i see a rat run directly in front of me. this was my first time here and most likely my last. i don't even want to think about what the kitchen looks like.no thank you."
worst arby's ever and the service is terrible. left half my food as it wasn't as good as other arby's
"its a better alternative in the fast food chain but can get pricey quick... i order a smoke short rib sandwhich and a salted caramel cookie ... the sandwhich was well put together unlike mcdonalds where you unwrap your order and ketchup, pickles and onions are hanging on the side of the burger. it does take a while to get your order. behind the counter the employees do seem to be a bit on the hoodlum side so they don't seem to be approachable but they will answer any questions asked... impossible to get parking in the area very busy and next to the bus terminal and a few hotels ...  very spacious and didn't seem crowded so getting a seat isn't impossible... i think i covered everything enjoy!"
"this particular arby's was very clean and well tended. the line moved quick and the staff seemed upbeat (laughing and talking). the prices are typical of fast food in ny but the quality is clearly better than the other options. while it is missing the spicy pepper sauce, it does have two types in packet form available for guests. the clean interior, quick service, and free refills make it a good stop leaving penn or heading towards penn."
"the gal on monday night was super sweet. (wish i got her name) since the revamp, not only is the food super fresh.... but where else can you get these prices???"
i don't know if it's food poisoning or not... all i know is i ordered the brisket sandwich and an hour later i'm doubled over in pain on the toilet. never had an issue with the same exact meal at the arby's on 23rd street
"""we've got the meats"" more like houston we've got a problem. this place gave me such bad gas my gf told me the only viable place i should live is the moon. one bite and you know you've made a terrible mistake. my toilet bowl looks like a jackson pollock painting. when i sat down in the bathroom i realized my cat was in the bathroom with me. as soon as i started what can only be described as a fire hydrant opening on a hot summer day my cat butters ran towards the door trying to claw her way out. the door handle was too far for me to reach and i could only watch in horror as my cats eyes welled up with tears. she hasn't sat on my lap since. will not be going to this establishment again."
"i had not eaten at an arby's in well over 20 years. there was one in queens i used to go to as a child that closed down ages ago. other than it having a roast beef sandwich, i did not remember much about it. i ended up having the roast beef sandwich with cheese and it was okay (not great, but not bad). the meat portion was generous with a thick roll bun but i thought the flavor was a little bland.pros:-this location opened a year ago and is very modern and clean inside.-even during rush hour, it was less than half full with plenty of seating-free drink refills from a state of the art touch screen drink dispenser-low prices - comparable to mcdonalds and burger king-good crispy curly friescons:-like i said, i did not remember much about this chain. the menu is actually fairly limited. no hamburgers at all - mainly cold cut type sandwiches or chicken sandwiches"
manager with the purple hair is amazing !! so refreshing to have such nice people working !
"all the commercials for food restaurants that are never in nyc comes on tv a billion times so when they finally come here, the kid in me makes sure to try it at least once just for the hell of it. i got a chicken sandwich with fries and it's was just okay."
we tried to eat there today there was a small line and after over 10 minutes it didn't move my wife went up to the counter to try and get an employee's attention and find out what the problem was no one came to help her and just completely ignored her as she went to get back in line some ghetto ass most likely puerto rican girl with pink hair who was an employee started to yell at her that she was cutting in line and created a giant scene finally the manager came over and ask the people in line if my wife was already in line to which they said yes she was. the super low class employee with pink hair continued to talk s*** in the background so we took our business elsewhere..... that girl should be fired immediately
"r. is in the building.arby def got the meat. got a trio of sliders: the buffalo chicken; chicken 'n cheese; & the ham 'n cheese. the best one is definitely the buffalo chicken--crunchy and meaty, not dry. the chicken 'n cheese is basically the chicken without the buffalo spices. the ham n cheese was average. the key to elevating the sliders from above-average to delicious is the arby's sauce (bbq sauce) and horsey sauce (horseradish). the buffalo chicken slider + bbq sauce + horsey sauce was awesome!those curly fries though. fried bliss.the touchscreen soft drinks dispenser is cool. but i've seen that before.the ambience decor--still feels very new. very modern. spacious. & clean. even after months of being in the gross blanket of 8th ave and the port authority. amazing job by the arby's staff bc so many human stinkbombs roll through here all the time...yet the mod casual dining area remains 100% unsullied. the staff have to be hardworking. they aren't very good re: questions about the food. but hey all things considered...they are doing a good job.drops mic cuz i'd rather stuff my mouth then drop some knowledge on you punx. loli out.zzz"
i originally came in here because i could order a pepsi and plug in my phone and charge it on my way to the bus at port authority lol.  but one day i ordered the 3 cheese steak sandwich and omg delicious.  today i ordered the side salad and jalapeño bites--they are delicious and the salad is super fresh.  i'm ordering more jalapeño bites to take on the bus!  the staff has always been very friendly to me.  highly recommend!
"the staff seemed uninterested in helping us at the register. the drawer was out of ones and we had to wait for change. despite the drawer being out of ones, the employee took the next customers order and money. eventually there was a line of 3-4 customers waiting to get change back. the soda machine was out of almost everything and even though employees saw a group of us struggling to find a soda that was available, they didn't go change the syrup bags for the soda fountain. and the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting! one toilet was clogged, the other had urine all over the seat. no toilet paper or paper towels. just an over all gross, unpleasant experience."
"3.5 starswas looking for a spot to eat at around my rotation site and since i've never tried this chain before i decided to give it a try. not bad! i think they specialize in bbq sandwiches and the smokehouse brisket sandwich that i got was pretty good! bread was soft, onion rings were crispy, gouda cheese added all the right flavors, and condiments blended in very well. the brisket itself was a little dry though but had a very nice smokey taste to it. i also got the curly fries and thought they were ok. 3.5 stars but i will round up because the service was super fast and friendly!"
"this location was nice and the woman behind the counter taking my order was kind. took a while to get our food but that's okay with me since it was tasty. their sandwiches are crazy filling, so i suggest only getting one, or possibly splitting with someone if you're not that hungry."
"ok. i am an arby's addict. i love arby's. i can eat soooo much arby's. so you can imagine my reaction knowing there would be an arby's in manhattan!!!!!!! there is only one other in the entire city...and it is out in queens. so yes, arby's right in the smack middle of manhattan! what!?!!!!!!?!?!?!!!!!!!!?!!?!!!!exactly. so i had to go. i ordered my beef and cheddar meal. the classic arby's best of. curly fries, a beef and cheddar sandwich and a drink.  check out.  annnnnnd...no arby sauce!!!!!! they ran out! an arby's without arby's sauce is not arby's!!!!!!  they should have prepared for the onslaught of people eating all the arby's sauce and had much more on hand. the staff were nice enough to give me a little cup of red ranch sauce instead...but let's be real. i want that beef n cheddar slathered in arby's sauce. it is how it must be eaten! this location is not as great and delicious as the queens location. i will be honest and say, they didn't stuff the beef n cheddars, the bread was a little powdery tasting, but if it had arby's sauce, most likely it would have still done the trick. they do have fancy soda machines though! like browsing an ipad for drinks... you can add flavors to every cola etc. enjoy! staff also promised that never again would there be an arbys sauce shortage. so please check it out and hold them accountable!"
"it's finally here! a full-sized, eat-in arby's on 40th and 8th! you've gotta love all their options for sandwiches and salads...but the true magic lies in the roast beef sandwich. smother it in arby's sauce and horsey sauce for the full experience...and a little extra on the side for dipping. throw in some curly fries and a jomocha shake and you've got yourself something truly special. yeah, it's fast food and no, it's not a new york original...but who the hell cares? it's good food, fast. at reasonable prices. it doesn't get much better than arby's."
"it's fast food what can i say. nicely done decor - like an upmarket horse stable in nyc. clean, prompt service, kind and friendly staff, two levels, and cool light fixtures.  they have a daily happy hour where they offer sliders & shakes for $1.00 - that's a nice bang for your nyc buck!"
"sorry...didn't do it for me.floors were dirty.   tables not wiped down.  in fact, there were corporate people sitting at the next table having a discussion and nothing seemed to phase them.   i have to wonder if this is a greater problem than anyone really sees.if you are going to have an establishment - keep it clean.   service your sandwiches, etc. fresh and hot.    i ordered onion rings - got five to my order for the price i paid.   come on guys.....what gives?not really happy."
"i accompanied a friend of mine, twice. twice the floors were dirty. the restroom floors were sticky and the aroma was  suffocating.   the staff were very courteous. i wish burger king were in its place."
"3.25/5the quality of the ingredients seem to be better compared to that of mcdonald's, and did not give off that ""chemical process taste"" impression.as another yelpy has written: ""when your food actually looks like the picture."" soo true. i was surprised by how full my chicken sandwich looked as soon as i opened the box.aside from the presentation, the foods could have been cooked longer, or preferably piping hot & steamy.chicken sandwich:-the chicken was nice and crispy. i didn't really like the sauce but it was still palatable. the shredded cabbage got in the way of my enjoyment of the sandwich. could be hotter.curly fry:-was not greasy(good)-not hot enough. -sort of staletriple chocolate chip cookie:-stale-dry-tastelessultimate chocolate shake(snack size):-basically vanilla soft serve infused with pumps of chocolate syrupbathroom-yesservice-quickambiance- modern music- from 2010+(fairly modern)cleanliness- floors were dirty and 4 seater tables were unkempt"
"burgers great, dessert bad! 4 stars still because arby's is foremost burger joint. service - staff are quite friendly.burgers - flavorful, juicy and diverse. there's so many choices for you - pork, beef, chicken and currently turkey too! different cheeses and toppings are available, although it's no five guys.desserts - noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.the cookies are crunchy. too crunchy. like, dry wood crunchy.the apple crisp is just nasty.the shakes taste so artifical. they all look nice though, pics attached. the decor is pretty fun."
"i have never been to an arby's and was reluctant to try it. however, i was walking by and needed to grab food quickly so decided to try it out. i got the smokehouse brisket meal and was surprised at the taste. the curly fries they serve are also a notch better than other fast-food burger places. note, it's still fast food, however it had a good taste. this location was pretty clean and staff was nice."
this arby's opened up couple months ago. i go here because it's convenient to walk to since i attend baruch college. the interior of this fast food chain is modern and better than most food chains. the staff working were extremely welcoming and kind. i would give this a go if you want to get some decent food when limited on time.
"first off their customer service bell should be used for attitude adjustment rather than satisfactory service.  i respect the service industry but when you clearly demonstrate that you give zero f*cks, it's not a good look.  i arrived and ordered 2 gyros salads, so far so good.  i received my receipt and was given the name ""chria"".  correction, i'm not a chria pet nor russell wilson's wife.  i waited about 5 minutes and my to-go order arrived and the customer service guy calls out chria like it's a real name.  i asked him if it's chris and he said no.  i looked at my receipt and the number matched the order number.  arby's should pay me the $9.25/hour or whatever inflated figure it is right now because i just did his job.  you would have thought that was the worst part but no.  they got the order wrong.  i was given 2 gyros rather than the salads.  when i asked for the correct items, the three customer service reps all looked dumbfounded like i screwed up.  at that point it was late and i've lost all patience for incompetence."
it's arby's. why am i reviewing an arby's?!?it's so nice inside in keeping with this 23rd street local. i didn't know arby's could be fancy.modern fixtures and wood counters. there is a small second floor. there are tons of people here tonight at 6pm and they're walking around asking people if they're happy with their meal.the sauces are readily available for now in bins near the modern soda fountain. we'll see if it lasts but for the mean time enjoy the shiny brand new arby's!
"although this location has a nice interior and is very spacious, avoid it at night and during the weekends. i'd much rather go to mcdonald's where your order is taken right away by kiosks. i was waiting to order and a man was standing by the register signaling for someone else to take my order. he had his headphones in and just completely disregarded me and my time. it's kinda sad when you'd rather want a machine to take your order as opposed to an actual human being."
"disgusting!!! the manager with the red hair is rude and clearly doesn't have manors. they need to hire better staff.  the service they provide is unexceptionable. i'm thankful that the food service place i work at doesn't tolerate employees like the ones they've hired. how are you serving customers food that's suppose to be hot, cold? and get mad. if anything, you ask, ""what's wrong with the order?"" not talking to customers like their your friends in the street. better off going to mc donald's save your $."
"ah, it's nice to come back to an arby's. basics, order and pick up your food from a line. the display blocks much of the processing (part of the fun of watching your beef get cut), but the super roast beef tastes pretty much on-point with the curly fries. anyone who goes should be ordering the roast beef, i don't really know why you'd try the fish...anyway, cons: tables dirty... wow, someone needs to come by and clean that up. and music - straight from the radio, when i hear a mcdonald's ad on the speakers, i mean, c'mon, put on some pandora or something? also no snack sized shake (despite being on the menu). for a nice new location, they could use some cleaning and some better signage, the food is much like what i'd expect from the past (pretty consistent)."
i don't usually give five stars to chains and a burger joint at that but this location deserves it. everything is on point. the place looks nice plenty of room to sit order came out fast. and the most important thing is the burger it actually taste good and at the right price point $9 for burger fries and drink all u can i'm going to try their summer selection next week.
they have the meat mountain here. gigantic sandwich with basically all the meats. #chicken tenders #turkey #ham #corned beef #brisket #angus steak #roast beef  #pepper bacon. only $10. pretty good deal for all that meat. no wonder why i have gout.
"while i do love the food here, your just can't get a tastier hot sandwich with sliced meats at a better price or speed. it's perfect at lunch. but i also love the constant stream of new products. that aside, always great customer service here and always smiles on faces. the dining room is always clean as are the bathrooms. big big fan."
"this location is very understaffed during the evening hours. we were helped by will and cody who were trying their best to get everyone's food out in a timely manner but it was obvious that they were understaffed, it seemed like these 2 were the only 2 in the store. in fact i am sure they this was done on purpose there were about 4-5 stations and only 2 people available so one had to make food and the other had to take orders. pretty sure this was a case of management trying to cut labor and so they make 2 men (black men) run around like slaves trying to do the work of a whole team. this was disgusting and heart breaking to watch. i don't know these 2 men but i know they deserved better than to be yelled at and berated because they don't have enough staff to help them. management needs to do better."
"arby's ain't really my cup of tea, but my fella loses his mind every time the commercial comes on, so i was happy to see this location open up on 23rd street. the store is new and pretty nice, more in the vain of causal dining restaurant then fast food. the employees were all really nice, way nicer than is typical. my fish flatbread was okay. better than the fish sandwich at wendy's but not as good as mcdonald's fish sandwich. but no one cares because who goes to arby's for the fish?  i will say that i did like that there were 3 versions of the sandwich. i do think arby's would do themselves a favor by adding a vegetarian option like a veggie burger or grilled cheese sandwich. my fella liked his roast beef sandwich. liked it a lot. on to the sides. the curly fries were good, and they provide a couple of different sauces for free, which is nice. i ordered the jalapeno poppers thinking i just wanted to try one and i'd throw the rest away. i ate every single one of those bad boys because they were f-ing delicious. i've never had better ones that were not home made.  i'd come back anytime when my man is jonesing and i want to say well done arby's, you hired a great crew, keep it up."
"i'm not sure why arby's is such a rarity in manhattan. (or sort of in general these days.) that said - the food was typical arby's fare. i love me some curly fries dipped in horsey sauce...not even gonna lie about that. so when i was walking by, fully intending to go to verts next door i was like ""oh hey, holy crap...an arby's!""because this place is really new it's fairly nice. i hope it stays that way. they have a fancy pepsi machine in the vein of a coke freestyle machine - but it seems more limited than the coke equivalent :(the people working here were a little too friendly and chipper...probably because the newness hasn't worn off yet."
"came here for lunch today after going to tutoring for acc 2101. when i entered, there was a line to place orders.i gave the cashier the coupon for a free roast beef sandwich with a small drink from signing up for offers. i also ordered their loaded curly fried and onion rings. they use high tech soda machines similar to five guys. after filling my drink, i showed a crew member my receipt and he give me my order. i saw that they have a roast beef shredder and the place is busy. several customers ringed the bell to indicate good service. i ringed the bell before leaving."
"this place gives other fast food joints such as mcdonalds, wendys, burger king competition with it's $1 meal between 3pm-6pm. you can get any slider, fries, drinks, cookie and shake for $1. totally worth every penny. this is my first time trying arbys and i will be back.it's great for students and people on a tight budget. the food is not as greasy as other places. everything i ate was great and a must try. i had the turkey slider, cookie butter shake, fries and salted caramel chocolate chip cookie. i'm satisfied. small portions but fulling. my meal came up to $4.36. what a bargain."
"i can't believe how there are not that many arbys. i like the simple roast beef type sandwhich with horsey sauce (light mayo horseradish flavored condiment)  i've only gone through drive thru after shopping at that safeway in the same center. the order takers are nice. my order is just the smaller version, as it's enough for a me., before dinner.i always get the waffle fries too. sometimes the soda is flat but i'm already on the road so i don't complain. i feel it's healthier than some fast food burger places.hard to beleive it's 2.5 stars as they deserve higher amount of stars imho"
"for an inexpensive lunch, i like arby's occasionallyi like the roast beef sandwich. i like it with horsey sauce!for some  odd reason, i like it with orange juice.   so, that is my go to drink there.this is a good arby location."
ok - don't get me wrong. i love arby's. but i can see why they are closing. they're all run down and in disrepair. which reflects in how the food is prepared and presented. weak and not even close to what you see on tv. obviously the franchise owners don't care and corporate doesn't care to enforce their image and quality. this sucks as it could be so much better.
might sound weird but i really like their turkey sandwich. it's like 1000 calories but make it's huge. bread is super soft and the ingredients taste fresh - even the veggies have a snap. i've had the beef and cheddar (the classic) and it's exactly what you'd expect. always get more arby sauce!
"arbys is amazing. bay area you are full of shit!you guys talk all that health food crap but you have mcdonald's and burritos everywhere. arbys is one of the few fast food chains that doesn't do burgers and has a unique and relatively healthy menu. no you guys want the same crap. the same bland thai food. the same shitty indian food. the same ol burritos on every corner. the bay area is the worst region for food in the entire country. i am supposed to believe that a bowl of raw fish and rice packaged as something new is more popular than this? no you people suck and you have terrible taste. enjoy eating the same shit every day. i am going to have awesome roast beef. real curly fries. actual chicken sandwiches. dope ass salads. in and out is trash. that beef is not as fresh as arby's roast beef!!!arby's rules. fuck you bay area, i am tired of burritos."
poor service no customer service skills whatsoever i asked for a beef and cheddar on a regular bun and they're unwilling to accommodate this very simple request that every other arby's takes care of ridiculous. restaurant looks dirty and run down save your money go somewhere else
believe it or not but this arby's is a good place to pick up that roast beef sandwich. i came here for dinner and it still has that great arby's taste and flavor. the sandwhich meat was moist and seasoned just right.
"went to arby's on thursday nite at 9:50pm  sign said dining room open till 10:30pm.  lights off inside, door open.  went inside to be told they are closed.  you should close when you say your closed!"
"who runs out of beef at arby's., and doesn't tell you until 15 minutes later.  drove 17 miles one way.  you may want to call first and check if they have beef"
"i love arby's the food is awesome, however, i can not say the same thing about the guy in the drive through window. at the speaker i ordered 3 things which i had to repeat 3 times. got to the window and i gave my card to pay the guy tries to hand me a soda i did not order, i ended up paying the same price. anyway he asked me what did you order and told him a 4th time my order. finally got my order and drove off only to find out my order was wrong, its hard to understand how this clown has a job!"
shitty shitty experience!so it starts off with me ordering a #10 would you like regular or curly fries.  uh regular fries please sorry we only have curlyok if all you have is curly i'll take curly.  can i also get a #7?did you say #7yes #7is that the french dip?yes that's what the menu says!get to the window im handed a receipt with a sharpe to sign with.  can i please get someting hard to sign on?  i get a strange look and he hands me a credit card cliboard. huh imagine that... mind you we are the only car in the drive thru and no customers inside.  we wait 8 minutes for our food and it's cold!wtf!!! will never ever come back here again!
"i came here during lunch once.  we were going to go to jack in the box, but we kept going in circles and just gave up.  so we ate here.  it was super meaty.  i loved it."
"it's arby's.  of course it's mediocre.   what did you expect?  if you're eating here though, that probably doesn't bother you.   also, weirdly enough, the corporation has a pretty sweet twitter account, so you might want to check that out."
"we visited this place many times before.  today, after we placed our order and waiting for our order, the staff saw me coughing.  he offered me a cup for water.  among our orders was 3-piece potato cakes.  while they were preparing our orders, my wife wanted to change the potato cakes to 4 pieces. we asked them to give us 4 pieces of potato cakes.  we offered to pay for the 4th piece but they gave us the 4th piece free."
"worst management you could ask for. lost my business indefinitely. overpriced for what they offer already, they wasted my time while determining that they didn't want to participate in a company wide promotion. seems a little known promotion, that only lasted a day, reduced the price only on their original sandwich, for an eclipse event that doesn't come around in decades, which was emailed to me twice by their own corporate promotions department, was too much for the nonexistent management/ownership to be honorable with. weak and complete disappointment."
can't really say i enjoyed my self at this place. jalapeño poopers had cottage cheese or at least if felt that way when it should be a melty goodness. sandwich felt fresh for sure but not sure if i'm willing to return for that. subway may be out of the bag veggies but at least it tastes good. but what's up with the smell in though. it was bad i almost walked out. let's be clear i didn't say that place was dirty just saying it smelled like brisket was not the only thing being smoked in that place. some one should just leave the door open. wanted to leave a 2 but they were friendly. it would be wrong. long story short i won't go back and not because the food was bad even though i could not stomach it. it may have been a bad self choice item i chose to get i wouldn't be back because i couldn't deal with the experience as a hole. buy there food hear but just do so knowing you have read my review.
decent french dip sandwiches. good to go and grab a quick bite for lunch. arbys sauce is tasty too.
"have never gotten arby's till now!drive through was great. fast service.nice guy at the window.the corned beef sandwich i had was really good. oh my god, what a change from the usual burger. the marbled rye was soft and the beef was delicious, thin and tender. the curly fries were so-so, which is ok...i didn't eat as many, so that's really alright.i'll be back next time i'm in the mood!!!"
"been to this store for a number of years. always like their food even though the management does not seem to care about updating the store...looks very dated, wall paper ripping, food display a mess (empty trays). today, went there thinking i can enjoy their ac because of the very hot weather.  surprised!  they do not have ac, just a tiny fan at the sun room. the restaurant is too hot to stay in.  ordered onion rings...worst i have tasted...re-cooked, cannot find the onions (all dried up), the batter was hard.  don't want to go back again. at a time when even big m has to pull out all stops to get business, arby's definitely is on the way out."
drive thru closed at 7pm. last two times they had root beer on their drpepper spout. that's three strikes and you're out arbys.
decided to give it a go here late night and i was glad i did! really nice people work there and the food was amazing i was actually surprised. i was going in there thinking this just a fast food spot but the food had quality and freshness. definitely try this place. i got the gyro sandwich lamb. it was fire!
"i must admit i have dined infrequently at arby's over the years. there might be a correlation to my last experience; or, it might be a correlation to the fact this particular fast-food franchise has slowly disappeared from sprawling metropolitan areas.how many arby's locations across la can you name?how about mcdonald's ? there's a reason. and that reason is arby's is overpriced with a mediocre product that is questionable on the freshness level.you want proof: the meat has a shiny blue/pink/rainbow shimmer to it.yuck. bad sandwich is bad. who craves rainbow slimy meat?and at almost ten dollars, why not visit the top round roast beef on la brea and olympic?i will say that the saving grace of arby's are their curly fries. love the seasoning, and a hefty douse of arby's sauce makes this the lone only."
"the arby's manager was very friendly and customer service was above average. they learned my name. then, brought my order to the table. anyways, i pass this arby's like almost every time i'm in the area. the 1/2 pound roast beef sandwich is a recommended fast food hardbody/body builder choice. and pinchable me can use this secret information to my advantage. who doesn't want a beautiful body?anyways, this sandwich has way too much meat. also, i found the roast beef to be salty. however, i heard it's perfect. and i heart that horseradish sauce. tasty. the value meal (1/2lb sandwich, fries, med drink) came up to about the same cost as my order (1/2lb sandwich, sm drink)... however, it probably doesn't matter for me because the sandwich was too much to handle. great location."
"terrible, terrible customer service through the drive through. the wait was immeasurable. absolutely ridiculous."
white managers ---that are surrounded with a  full people of color staff is so disturbing to me
"(dined 04/14/17 fr @ 4:00pm): arteries really blocked, you see!i honestly couldn't remember the last time i ate at an arby's (college for sure over 20 years ago!). but, i recently signed up for their birthday club which entitled me to a free shake with any purchase. rarely one to allow any free food go to waste, i headed toward the location closest to me after a long day of work and gave it a shot. of course, i ordered more than was necessary. would i return to arby's let alone this location again!?:jamoca shake size small ($2.49) - my ""free"" birthday month item, the thickness was reminiscent of a jack-in-the-box shake where it felt like you sucked your lungs out! the frosty chocolate-coffee flavor wasn't too sweet and consistent throughout. it was rather pleasing and was definitely a meal on its own yelp.com/user_local_phot….[onion rings/straws/strings alert - 4.0 of 5.0 stars]steakhouse onion rings ($2.09) - five thick-cut, battered and fried until crispy, these weren't thin, over-cooked onion straws; rather, these rings were big enough to require two hands! they came out hot, the dark tan brown crunchy batter was excellent and didn't crumble, and each onion ring (not sweet maui) stayed intact when bitten into. no dipping sauces required.jalapeno bites 8 pieces ($4.59) - this 8-piece order of plump spicy jalapeno halves filled with warm melted cream cheese with a side packet of funky raspberry-tinged bronco berry sauce was an impulse starving buy. each had a nice crunchy outside, but beware of the lava-like cream cheese that oozed out when you bit into each popper! as for the sauce...what the heck was its purpose!? it seemed more suited for a piece of toast; stay away! otherwise, this fried food was truly a meal unto itself.king's hawaiian fish deluxe sandwich ($4.59) - crispy wild-caught alaskan pollock, a thick slice of cheddar cheese, tomato slices, shredded iceberg lettuce, and a tangy tartar sauce all held together between fluffy king's hawaiian sweet buns (swoon!). the fish piece was a large elongated triangle with a golden brown crispy outside and a juicy moist inside. the rest was just window dressing. arby's stepped up their game with this offering which was a nice surprise for my non-meat friday yelp.com/user_local_phot….service - i was immediately greeted by two young women behind the counter eager to take my order. i needed some time to peruse a more extensive menu than i remembered way back when (not just roast beef sandwiches and fries anymore). once ready, i rolled out the order, paid quickly, grabbed a table, and minutes later someone brought my food to me. overall, it was a very pleasant experience.parking (free) - they had a small private lot that was full. luckily, i found a spot on the street (1-hour parking from 8:00am-4:00pm mo-fr) right next to the restaurant. otherwise, there was ample street parking along the main drag of sunset blvd. and all surrounding side streets.atmosphere, décor, ambience - your typical fast food floorplan with the order counter front, center, and with a visual overhead menu board while the interior dining area was filled with a mix of booths, tables, and counter seating. a ton of natural lighting flooded in through the large glass windows (many of which were covered with standard promotional posters; the only decorations) that surrounded the entire restaurant while large electric ceiling light fixtures were needed once nighttime came along. no tvs, but wretched top-40 music played mildly in the background. yelp.com/user_local_phot…attire - totally casual, so i would normally be in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops.overall, i appreciated arby's birthday promotion as it was a cheap form of getting foot traffic through the door; and, in this case it obviously worked! their menu was completely different from what i remembered (in a good way), and generally speaking i felt the food was more than decent..especially the onion rings. as for this hollywood location, it was a homeless hangout (one inside and two outside) on my visit which was off-putting. i found fairly good value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (my total paid experience was around $15.00 before any discounts or tip). and, they accepted my credit card of choice...amex! 3.5 stars"
"the general manager is a general douchebag. tip for future customer service: don't go chasing cars off the lot when they have literally been there for only 5 minutes. maybe asking if i were going to go inside would have been a more appropriate approach rather than rapping on my window and telling me to leave the parking lot immediately. guess you'll never know if i had planned to be a customer there or not.  treating potential customers like trespassing criminals isn't the best business practice, imho."
"chicken strips were chewy, jalapeño bites tasted as if they were in the freezer to long, and the loaded curly fries were cold. best thing i had was the free cup of water."
"i love arby's and i asked my boyfriend if he had ever tried it and he said no, so i took him here to try it, and he makes me take him there at least three times a month now. he loves it. potato cakes are bomb, im sad they got rid of their dollar menu. last time i was there i went through the drive through and had a more than pleasant experience, there was a mishap and they forgot our potato cakes, and they made up for it with oreo bites which were bomb, so i was happy to wait a few minutes. raul was the one helping us out."
they have a new menu called triple thick brown sugar bacon it's the blt it's really good i think it's one of the best that they serve and the people here are friendly and courteous helpful i give them 4 stars worth to eat.
"as the meat ribbons were folded onto themselves like dying stars i breathed an earth-shaking sigh, seized by my recognition of the abyss that slowly pried apart the stitches of my senses like a ghostly mirage on the horizon. alone in my booth i quietly waited like a marooned sailor or a beached whale, giving in to entropy. as i sat i wondered:what business do they have creating such meaty cruise tickets to the void? what wretched ichor fills their sandwich-shaped molds? how can we live with ourselves for having summoned this beast of temptation?and on a red plastic tray the sandwich came to me, a single bell ringing in the deep misty night.each bite revealed its own separate divine mystery. the first opened the vast gates and with each successive mouthful a new stretch of the great beyond revealed itself to me as if i were living in a theater my whole life and finally the curtains were slowly being drawn. the celestial pantheon performed its gargantuan drama as the ribbons broke down in the acid of my stomach. the eternal cycle of birth and death became fully realized, the cosmic truths shone like gems in candlelight and the heart of simplicity was torn out in sacrifice as the faces of my fellow arby's customers faded away in a myopic blur.i returned from the void enlightened and pregnant with one beautiful revelation: the name ""arby"" is not a person's name. in fact it is a truncation of a different word, a common word that aptly describes not only this sandwich chain but indeed all of human existence:""arbitrary"""
"thank you for the kind greeting and smiles.  food was served promptly just as ordered.  restaurant is very clean despite the lunch hour, things are picked up and swept."
"the curly fries tasted nasty. like they needed to change the oil they deep fried them in yesterday nasty. this ruined my whole order. i've been going to arby's for a couple weeks since i discovered the rueben sandwich, so i've been getting the same combo with curly fries on maybe 3 or 4 total visits. my last arby's was in santa maria only 2 days prior and i love the fries. this was my first time to the hollywood location. so i know how the fries are supposed to taste at arby's. had to throw these out. they were not burnt. they were most definitely cooked in some very dirty oil."
"to say my meal was disappointing is an understatement. i came through the drive-thru earlier today, and let me start off by letting you know that i have not been to arby's in literally like 20 years. for some odd reason i was craving an arby melt, so i decided to stop in when i finally passed by one and itch my scratch...i saw the menu and noticed that the arby melt was no longer on there, so i got the next best thing or at least what i thought would be the closest to it- a beef and cheddar sandwich... boy was i disappointed with this excuse of a ""sandwich"". i got a single not a double or triple or whatever, but even if i had just gotten the sandwich by itself what i received definitely wouldn't have been worth the $4-something that it costs. the bread tasted somewhat stale, there wasn't much meat on the sandwich itself, and there literally was probably less than a teaspoon of cheddar sauce on half of my sandwich... actually, not half, but like a quarter of the sandwich add cheese on it... super disappointing!! i actually didn't even finish the sandwich because it really just wasn't even worth meeting and it wasn't doing anything for the craving that i initially had. i got curly fries with my meal, and they were good, hence the two stars... for my drink i ordered iced tea and i had forgotten that the ice tea does not come sweetened, and didn't think it was unsweetened since i wasn't offered any sweetener or sugar... needless to say the tea pretty much sucked but by the time i realize this i was already gone and couldn't do anything about it. maybe i'll try the arby's by my house in lakewood, and hopefully i'll get what i was initially looking for. as for this arby's, i won't be coming back."
"just opened this week 6/23. clean place, friendly  staff, comfy booths and great food."
"amazing service! very clean, i came here a long time ago and the same guy mr gary was here and i remember i had a great experience. time has repeated itself. he's very professional and kind. he looks like a guy who genuinely cares about this restaurant."
there was no arby's in the area i grew up in but i've always seen the commercials on tv. my boss got wind of it so he decided to bring me here. the lady at the register was very patient with and was able to explain what they had to offer. being that it was my first time here i decided to go with the classic and get the medium beef and cheddar sandwich. there wasn't anything special about it. i'm not really a fan or roast beef but i would like to try the buffalo chicken sandwich.
"why am i writing a review of arby's?  i'm sure i'll figure it out in therapy today...i am a busy person and go through phases.  some weeks i want all of my meat to come from a farm where the animal is cared for and fed nothing but organic feed.  then reality sets in and i decide it takes too much time to cook my meals and wash dishes (side note:  i was so sick of looking at my dishes in the sink, i tossed them, again perhaps something i will talk about in therapy...) and have a life and a career.i can get into fancy places and food once in awhile, but generally like to keep things simple, i.e., nothing that involves a server and tipping.  i don't usually eat fast food, but this place was in the right place at the right time today.first, plenty of parking on both sides of the building.  there is a drive through that i have never quite figured out how to use.  second, the place is small, so it almost feels like you are ordering from your car when you walk in.third, place was very clean and the staff was friendly.  the manager was even going through the dining area and spacing the tables and instructing his employee how to tidy up the space, etc.  reminded me of something out of downton abby.fourth, the food took a little longer than expected, but since i was eating in, they brought it out to me on this cool, round tray.  everything looked perfect.  and everything was hot.granted, this is arby's and the meat reminds me of the lunch meat my mom used for our sandwiches in kindergarten, so take the place for what it is.  i had the french dip, which looked and tasted exactly like the picture made it seem.  came with a pretty decent tasting au jus on the side as well.  fries were hot and crispy.  they aren't like in-n-out's, cut fresh, but they were still pretty solid.  and truth be told, i don't get the fries at in-n-out.  sure they are made fresh from a real potato, but they always taste like hot, wet paper to me with some salt sprinkled in.anyway, if you are sick of the usual suspects for fast food, arby's on sunset is sure to please.  i would give five stars, but it's still fast food, so four is max on my scale :)"
"very clean location. the manger here is doing a great job keeping the place clean and a place you feel like you want to eat at. arby's really make great food, although i am not big fan of their sweet ban, the meat is quality (and not just for a fast good place). i can say that many times this location will be my fort choice. i am not working in east la as i used to, but if i do, i know to have my lunch here."
i went there couple of time.very good sanwich and signature fries (love it). staff are nice and enjoyful.
"this particular arbys is located in a pretty funky mall that takes some effort to get in or out of.but for the arby fans... this is ok in that the service is fast, always yummy and consistent .  happy"
"man, i love arby's. my best friend and i grabbed a roast beef sandwich before a concert at the forum and a orange cream shake. we also couldn't pass up an order of their curly fries. this was a great location that came in clutch on our way to the concert. the drive-through is easy to access and exit back onto manchester. we will be back!"
"by far my favorite fast food place! drive thru is quick and the employees are really friendly. i don't feel rushed when i'm ordering like at other fast food places. my order is always correct and fresh. they have a great variety of sandwiches and love trying the new ones as they come out. there is a restroom outside of the restaurant, it's akward but at least they have one! they just started selling shakes and i fell in love, went back 2 days in a row to grab it. great place for a quick bite."
"wow, what a great change for arby's! i was pleasantly surprised walking in and seeing such a clean updated arby's. walking into the restaurant i was happy for a clean environment. food choices have changed considerably and it all looked great! the time was 1:00 pm and the crew was working together as a team to keep the drive-thru moving and the front counter moving. after getting my food i was looking around and the place is very clean, awards on the wall and a cool idea of a service bell to ring if you are pleased with the service. since i was very pleased i rang the bell and suddenly the whole crew yelled out thank you. such a neat little concept that seems to add nice value. i appreciated the food, service, cleanliness and overall great service! way to go arby's! nice to see you have improved over the years and now have a great fast food restaurant to enjoy! thank you!"
"this place is outstanding! i had not set foot in an arby's in at least 10 years, yesterday, 06/29/18 at 5:30, i went back for a 2nd visit....again outstanding. the food was perfect, and the staff are fun, smiling, and even when i asked for 8 horsey sauce for my 2 sandwiches, it was no problem and no extra charge. store is exceptionally clean, whatever they are getting paid, it's not enough. i'm making arby's my friday night dinner deal. you got me as a customer....please thank the staff...outstanding!"
i'm so glad there's still an arby's in the west side. they close the la cienega location a while back and now i have to drive to this one. every time i come is through drive thru and has been nothing but an good experience. i order the french dip w/o cheese... mmmmm soooooo goooood especially the dipping sauce.
"i come here to this particular arby's because it is the closest one to me, but now i see that they're not in the business of providing the "" meat "". they're regular market fresh sandwiches hardly have any. and you'd think for the price they should. we'll never again."
"haven't had arby's in years and we had to try their new turkey sandwiches. this place is so tiny! the woman at the drive through tonight was so sweet, she was very polite and was working hard. i love the fact that arby's even though they're a fast food place, their food actually looks close to their commercials. it was actually really good!"
"hadn't been since i was a kid. just as i remembered it. which is not a compliment. if only the food was as good as attitude of the workers. my 14 year old son liked his french dip, but he's easy to please. my roast beef and cheese with bacon was meh at best. even though the service earned four stars, the food only got two so don't think i'll be returning."
"awesome staff!!  always upbeat and in a good mood, even late-night.  they do a great job at keeping the place clean too!!"
"this location is near the lax airport, it is off of manchester blvd.  the only negative thing about this location is that the drive thru is pretty tight; however, there is plenty of parking to walk in.  the food is always fresh when i get it.  i usually get the classic roast beef, but i also try the promotional sandwiches when they have them, such as the brown sugar meat sandwiches that i wish they still had.  the cookies here are pretty damn good as well and they are made with ghiredelli chocolate.  expect no more than a 3-7 minute wait for your food.  it is also near the 405 freeway and one of the landmark giant donuts in inglewood.  i usually stop here after i finish walking my dog at the park nearby because this is the closest location near my house aside from the redondo beach location on pacific coast highway."
the closest arby's to my area. the location is right off 405 freeway. the restaurant has had a makeover and i have never been inside because i love the drive-thru and the parking lot is small. the food was delish as i remember it. my arby's cheddar cheese sandwich is my favorite. i was having an arby's craving at 10pm and they were open until 12am. perfect for me and my hungry guests. food always fresh.
"the cashier tried to charge me twice. he walked away then came back and tried to start another payment to which i informed him we'd already completed that. then i get home to find out my $5 chicken bacon sandwich was missing. when i was at the window i asked ""is that everything"" to which he said yes. then i get home and find out not.i call to inform & they're saying ""we tried to catch u but u pulled off!"" but it's like hello that's why i was at the window asking for all my food!! i didn't sprint away i simply drove like a customer should. they were having fun inside talking in spanish so i guess my review doesn't matter."
"i came here looking for what i remember arby's used to be. the place looks run-down.it could use a fresh coat of paint.  it looks like zero maintenance has been done in the past 20 years. employee is nice, flexible and friendly.  i went drive thru - however, even as a drive-through customer i could tell he was the only employee working the front part of the store (including the drive through) i ordered and it took about 15 minutes to get my food. the good news is that it was all nice hot and fresh.  the sad part is that during those 15 minutes i was the only customer.  this was at 6:45pm."
for my first time eating here at arby's i received great costumer service and rang the bell about 3 times and the food was great definitely recommend
this location is open alive and well! just got 3 delicious very delicious in fact sliders from here today. great customer service they have a lot of patience even when busy. stop by....
"the people who work here are helpful enough and never messed up an order of mine, which is all you really need when you're getting fast food. that and they never blink when i bring in a coupon (i.e. they don't argue about it like many places, and they know how to input it so it doesn't take forever).it's not really the nicest area, but i've never had any problems. there's a little lot that they share with a (what i hear is terrible) mexican restaurant and an adult video store, so maybe not the place you want to bring your kids though."
i had never been to this arby's before but i'm very impressed by the friendly staff and tasty meals. keep up the good work guys; you definitely deserve five stars.
"*** pit stop review (inglewood) ***this is a pretty standard fast food arby's. it's about a block away from the famous randy's donuts l.a. landmark. i love dropping by arby's to get their beef and cheddar burger. always love the 2 for $5 :-) this location is pretty clean, but the parking is a little small. the drive through is a little weird because it's connect to the driveway coming off of the street. when going through this drive-thru it's best to be the 1st car. all other cars will stick out into traffic on a major street. to me, it's like an accident waiting to happen.  this little place is above average because they keep it really clean. the food is exactly what i expected and the girl at the register was really friendly. food = good (as expected) seating area = clean service = great!restroom = average"
forgot about how bomb arby's is!! this place goes! their sauces here are delicious and so are the roast beef sandwiches!
"lol! i can't believe how many consistent 1 or 2 star reviews are given to this location!  i nearly feel like a liar giving them 4 stars, but i've been here twice now and both times were good except that both times, they had run out of some sort of food item.  the second time it was curly fries. sort of a crucial item to be out of. it's lunch time so i can only imagine what sales must have been like that day.other than that, compared to the hollywood location, this place is new, nice looking, clean, and close to work.  i haven't had issues with absent employees or cold food.  it's all around been good.  i guess i'm the exception?  true: they have no drive thru and parking is hit or miss but we've just done street parking and paid the $1 for an hour.  it's not a huge cost but most arby's are stand alone, have a parking lot, and you don't have to pay for parking.give it a shot noho.  it's nice to have an arby's in the area.  maybe they'll get new management to train the dismal employees the rest of you experienced."
"haven't been to an arby's in years and that was on a road trip since they don't have many in la area.i was aware of the arby's opening on lankershim and since they mailed us coupons recently, we decided to try them out, give us break from the kitchen during this holiday weekend.when we got inside (friday night) there were a couple of guys inside waiting for food and a few in line ahead of us. service was slow, when our turn came, the guy working there made us wait while he was messing with a tablet. there are 2 registers only, but just one opened.after we placed the order - 2 regular fried chicken sandwiches and a portion of onion rings, we were told we'd wait 5 minutes.the place is pretty small, they keep it cold, there are restrooms, a fountain station (of course the healthy drink choice is out), a loud tv on the wall and that's about it. it's noisy between tv, music and constant beeping from the kitchen, so it's not the best environment to eat at (for me anyways).more people were coming, it was just one person working in the kitchen so we waited for at least 15 minutes to get our order. frankly, everyone was waiting too long to get their orders, no one got anything our of ordinary, just your usual. for friday night, dinner time, they could have used 2 more people. so much for idea of fast-food!we saw how fast our sandwiches were slapped together (wish we could unsee that), buns, mayo, iceberg lettuce, 2 slices of tomatoes, chicken patties, put them in a box, there you go. 30 seconds. so, why the wait?it just reminded us why we barely do fast-food 1-2 times a year at the most. it's not fast, not convenient, and we know it's not good for you.we walked back home w. our food (we live close by) and the food was cold. sure, you can say, we walked home. yes, but in the past, it took us longer to drive back from a fast-food and it wasn't nearly as cold. the onion rings were ok, the chicken sandwiches were very small, bit bigger than sliders, nothing special. even w. a coupon isn't a great deal. we tried it, but we're not going back. it's a mediocre place with bad service and mediocre food."
"i had arby's before but not in la, this place is walking distance from where i live and i had some coupons in the mail so i decided to grab some quick lunch. i ordered the turkey club sandwich and i was a bit disappointed i paid for it $2.99 which was totally fine with it, but in all honesty i wouldn't have paid a cent more for the sandwich. the place looked clean, there is no parking, no drive thru, the staff was friendly and the bathroom were ok considering the area...not sure if i would come back or not"
"i was disappointed that this location ended up turning into an arby's because i just thought that downtown noho was better than that. but i got a coupon and i needed a walk so i went and got lunch there.i had a gyro with ""greek meat"" which could be donkey for all i care it was delish. i really enjoyed it. although i feel like a traitor for not going to rodini park for a gyro, the image on the coupon looked so good. like well done ad people.i still want to hate this place, cause ya know....trump, but i'll come again and try their normal stuff. the roast beef in the ad though looks hella school lunch meat though, so i'm not sure..."
"i waked past this place after visiting my favorite dispensary and figured i'd give them a go, being it was the new restaurant on the block.walked in and was immediately greeted with a friendly hello. i only really ever get one thing at arby's and it's the chicken sandwich meal.service was a1, the place was super clean, and my food was pretty damn good.couldn't quiet give them a perfect score because i need more condiments, lol."
"ok, i'm a sucker for a good commercial... but i only fall for it once if the food is not great. so... i've been watching these arby's commercial for a while now, with no place to release my inner ving rhames (yes that's him ending every ad with ""we have the meats!"")! well lo and behold they went and added one to my north hollywood neighborhood, and walking distance from the crib. i was greeted warmly by a smiling employee named skylar, as well as elizabeth, claudia, and the rest of the team. after consuming my first arby's meal in years (today's 2 for 1 gyro wrap deal), i have to say: delicious! the commercials worked people... i know they're known for the meats, but even the pita bread was warm, tender and tasty! tried the jalepeno bites which were really good... each nugget featuring a big piece of jalapeno, and just the right amount of cheese sauce. if you want an extra kick or just more flavor, try their sauce station which included a horseradish sauce (so tasty!)... and if you're from the east coast, you know the meat is begging for it.  i had a nice sized house salad which bumped up my health meter... and also helps me justify a chocolate shake, which they did not skimp on- very, very tasty. clean and modern decor that seats just under 50 people. i walked here, thank you very much, but i just heard there's parking in the back. so many delicious intriguing meat treats to try... next will be smokehouse brisket or the loaded italian. i can't believe its been open for 8 months and i just found it.  it's a tricky corner just down from starbucks at magnolia, and a bit hard to see. come on folks, let's keep this place open. they have the meats!!"
"i am sad to write this, as it is supposed to be a pleasure to have an arby's. close to my place. i waited a good 7 minutes before i was even acknowledged by a cashier. the cashier was male and seemed very unhappy to help. he was also rude. there were about 7 people in line when we witnessed one of the employees make herself a root beer float, so maybe she was on her break because i can't imagine she just really dgaf. whatever. i got my food & inspected it because i have had previous bad experiences- and noticed there wasn't any sauce on my gyro fries so i told the employee who lied and said it was ""under"". i told him i wanted more anyway, and glad i did because there wasn't. it was about 6:30 pm on 7/5- in case corporate wants to investigate- but i see that my review echos countless others, so i hope they can turn this around."
parking is impossible. luckily we found a spot literally in the front. this place is dirty. the tables dirty. soda area dirty. the floors disgusting and a hazard cause there's soda and water all over the floor. you definitely need to watch your step. there trash cans had the bag of trash next to it and no bag in it cause i think they forgot to come back and dispose of it and put the bag in. there out of napkins. out of soda lids. this is horrible for a brand new store. food was ok. it's just an arby's nothing special. we got the beef and cheddar which had more sauce then beef or cheddar. i tried the fish sandwich and it was pretty good. nothing special to write about. we went on a nice rainy day and it was freezing in there. they said they couldn't control the air even though the thermostat control panel was right by our table and set at 65. ugh! i'll go back in a few months and i really hope they've improved! as for now this place is a disaster!
my friend came here on his lunch break last week. waited fifteen minutes and did not receive his order. when he asked about it he was told it has gotten lost and not offered a refund. he told them not to worry about it and left. should have been offered a refund. it's sad the service is that fucking awful at a place where the food is fucking inedible.
"the 2 for $6 deal on beef/bacon/cheddar was really good. however trying to park around there can be a challenge. don't even bother with the parking lot in the rear. i did notice that every table that was vacant needed a wipe down, and there was only 3 other tables occupied ( 1 by the manager dining with her husband and kids)"
worst customer service. not only did they get my order 100% wrong but they were rude when we corrected them over the phone less than 10 minutes later. they would not refund me even after i came immediately after. with a receipt and food. i had to call my bank to get my money back. i realize i came in 20 minutes before closing but that is no excuse for poor customer service. i am also a manager at two restaurants near by and this was beyond unacceptable.
"what horrible service. after ordering it took almost 20 minutes to get our food. the curley fries were not with the order so they brought them seperately about 5 minutes later. food was fine but the lack of service ruined our time. i am aware this is fast food but when the service is so bad, it makes it where you don't want to come"
"wow... where to begin...tuesday evening at 6pm...  not very crowded.   nobody at the register to take my order...two minutes waiting, they take my order, and i pay.  i ordered the fish sandwich.i get my drink and wait... and wait...  and wait....nobody at the grill but the fryers are beeping and chirping.   a girl comes by and ours some fries in a small box and puts it aside and leavesand i wait... and wait... and wait...   finally she comes back, grabs the fish that has been sitting there in the basket and starts coughing.    one hand holding the food, the other arm converting her nose, but ... no.i'm not getting the flu tonight.   i'm not going down like this!i asked for my money back and left.   went to vicious dogs down the block."
this place sucks  and it's dirty. i ordered a meal and it was terrible. so i thought ok it can happen. then i tried to find a table to sit at and they were all dirty. i will never go to this place again what a shame. when i told the manager she did nothing about it so i just walked away didn't even eat my meal
"worst employee of all time, they are lazy and bar none very irresponsible. arby's executive need to save this branch."
i just went to the new arby's in north hollywood on lankershim and magnolia in los angeles ca. orders a beef and cheddar and large fry. drove all the way home and sat down to eat my food. no cheddar on my sandwich even though it was wrapped in a beef and cheddar wrapper. bread was cold and so was sandwich. fries weren't even full. go to arby's all the time. very disappointing!!!
how do i give negative stars?worst arby's ever!!!cold food takes forever to get ordershitty service on top they don't know what they are doing!!!
"yay! an arby's in north hollywood! i love arby's!!!except...there's no drive thru. but they've made up for that by opening it in the most inconvenient spot imaginable. there is a tiny parking lot in back that appears to be shared with about 5 other businesses, including starbucks. and all the side streets are filled with apartment buildings, so good luck there.but i persevered, finally found a spot, and walked 2 blocks to the beautiful , brand new restaurant. ordered my food, went to get my drink and discovered no lids, no straw, no napkins. luckily, i had plenty of time to get one of the employees to refill them since it took the better part of 15 minutes to get my food. which was 2 sandwiches and 2 fries.between the parking nightmare and the slow service, i'm pretty sure it would have been faster to go to in-n-out, during their dinner rush.  and i mean that literally.the food was fine.sorry arby's, i love you but i don't see this location getting much future business from me."
"it's in a terrible location; parking is virtually nill.service was slow and awkward ... it's a new location, perhaps that will improve with time.food was a disappointment. first we asked for ar-b-que sandwiches ... the response, ""what's that?  you're the 2nd person who's asked for that, tell me what it is and maybe i can make it.""  we said ""no ..."" we didn't want an ""experiment"" on us.we settled on a roast beef ""delux"" (includes lettuce & tomato).  the meat was sliced too thick; not the usual arbys ""thin.""  the meat tasted fine, but it's not the same mouth feel as when it's sliced thin.the arby's on sepulveda in mission hills is sooo well managed, and soooo consistently better.  i guess i'm spoiled by going to the mission hills location for fifty years (yikes!).i'll continue to get arbys every month or two, but i'll take the extra few minutes to run up to mission hills and get the better quality, better service, easy parking.  it's worth the few minutes to get the real deal."
"it's hard to screw up an arby's ... but they succeeded...it's simple... i was there about 5 minutes before closing and was told ""we are out of roast beef."" i don't believe that an arby's ran out of the product they are best known for selling .. which comes in large, cookable bags ... i do believe their newly hired staff cleaned the slicer and were ready to go home ... too bad for them, there isn't an excuse for being lazy ...."
"all of you arby's haters can shuffle off to buffalo. i love me some arby's. is it the best quality food you're ever going to eat? i don't know. is the roast beef made of real beef? i don't know. what i do know is that it's delicious and i can't wait to go back. i've actually come to like their market fresh sandwiches quite a lot. i had the chicken salad sandwich last time and really liked it. it's not too heavy. i also enjoy the mini roast beef sliders, because nothing beats a roast beef sandwich with arby's sauce. my only gripe is that the ""curly"" fries aren't very curly... they need to work on that.stay cheerful ;)"
"my old arby's disappeared off the planet many years ago from my city. packed up and vanished. when i walked in the door,  i noticed that this arby's is much cleaner, but i missed my old arby's. service was on par and my roast beef dip and fries with cheese and bacon and sour cream on it sure filled the spot. roast beef sandwich with cheese was fresh and tasty. but not as healthy a food as my doc wants me to munch on.awwe...  who cares"
"giving 2 stars because the food is as always, delicious. roast beef sandwiches are a must even though they have been a tad skimpy on the meat recently.the problem i have is the hours. they close way too early for a fast food place and on top of crappy hours, they close early! its hard enough making it by 10pm sometimes but wednesday night we went by 945 and they had locked the doors. 2 people were still inside eating but they refused to let us in. plus, numerous times the drive through window is empty. this wasnt the first time they closed early either. i understand that the workers want to clean and go home but the hours are til 10pm...not 9:30. not cool"
here again to eat their bbq smoke sandwich..love it!always plenty of meat in their sandwiches. friendly employee's with a smile on their face.
"as i was growing up in the san fernando valley, arby's was the first fast food that i had, so it was special to me as a teenager to go there and enjoy a 99 cent arby's roast beef sandwich.  now 40 years later, i am starting to enjoy these sandwiches again by joining the arby's club and getting free food with a purchase every so often.  the food is always fresh, and the coffee shakes are the best.  something addicting though is the full fledged beef and cheddar on an onion roll, which is one of the most savory sandwiches they make.  too bad i always gain weight when eating at arby's though.  i guess everything in moderation holds true to this day..."
"jamocha milkshake hit the spot. definitely will get it again, though i don't pass by too many arby'swas looking for a way to treat myself without breaking the bank, and something fast too. $4.59 for a large shake, which truly is massive. drive thru was quick and not too busy- 3 cars.minus stars for the sloppiness. workers probably overfilled the cup and then capped it, or the arby's cup design is flawed. probably the worker. she handed me the cup, a little sticky on the side (yuck, i'm driving and my hands on the wheel...). while i asked for napkins, melted milkshake drips down from where the lid meets the cup."
"since i work so close to this arby's, i have been coming daily to try out their entire menu.i'm shocked that there isn't many arby's around since i think their sandwiches are better because they're unique. i tried their gyro curly fries, the beef french dip, and other popular sandwiches and they were all delicious. there is a lot of parking since it shares with the 99 ranch and gamestop lot. if you love roast beef, i would highly recommend trying this fast food joint."
i went in on a saturday eve and ordered the ultimate blt... and it was ultimately the worst blt i have ever had. now mind you it could have been quite good their bacon is very good but this was all burnt beyond crisp and then i had to try and find any tomatoes.. which i finally did.. 2 tomatoes smaller than a 50¢ piece and just barely enough lettuce to cover them.. the bread is toasted on one side only it a special request to toast both sides¿ it's honestly not easy to screw up a blt this badly... ordered it to go so i didn't discover anything till i got home... needless to say it was the worst 7 bucks i ever spent
"the alhambra store was a very good visit for my wife & i. it's been awhile & arby's made a lot of health forward changes. i love the current gyros available & my wife ordered the turkey sandwich; came with whole-wheat bread & good amount of turkey slices. of course, curly fries & potato cakes are great- in moderation. hopefully be back soon. the store was very clean, the staff ran a tight shift & constant sweeping & table, seat wipe downs are very nice. the restrooms were also very clean. great staff & shift management. pleasantly surprised & satisfied."
"arby's is a fast food chain that promotes the phrase ""where's the meat?"" well my family and i happen to be in the area and we decided to drop in and try some of the new items on the menu. we came through drive thru and the person at the window got our order correct with no hesitation. the food we ordered did provide the meat and he is verdict from my wife and kids.* smoke mountain sandwich:o 3 meats, bbq sauce, cheese, and simply awesome. my son who is 7 and normally avoids meat ate the whole thing by himself so it is family approved. * buttermilk chicken sandwich:o crunchy and delicious with tons of flavor and better than other $2 chicken sandwich's from other competitors. * rueben:o the rueben sandwich that was treated traditional style went over very well from my oldest who doesn't do veggies and he ate it all just the way it came. * jamocha shake:o is a coffee and chocolate shake, need i say more it was thick cold and flavored with chocolate and a hint of coffee so it satisfies both coffee and chocolate fans. so i wish i had one closer to home because my family agreed it would be our fast food chain of choice. oh well till next time and keep up the good work."
"i ordered two big roast beef sandwiches the half pound to go. ended up getting something different when i get home. sucks that i have to drive all the way back to freaking tell them. very frustrating , garbage..."
"i usually come to this place for the three cheese steak sandwich, which does taste good. the service is good as well. when my order took a little bit too long, they gave me a free apple turnover."
i love arby's such a guilty pleasure!!! this arby's is so nice and clean. felt high end lol. great service and always great food... will go back for sure. thank u
this is my neighborhood arby's that i've been coming to as a kid.  my sister still really likes this place so she's here almost every other week it seems like.  food isn't bad.  their curly fries are the best.  the different variations of roast beef sandwiches are what they're famous for.arby's sauce is also a great sauce that no other place has (obviously). it's something that i always use a lot of.  it complements almost everything they have there.
"my friends and i were craving arby's once we saw the commercial with the brown sugar bacon sandwiches, so we made a pit stop after a long day of swimming. we placed our order and drove home, when we then realized the sandwich order was not correct, my friend doesn't eat turkey and that's the only reason i gave marvin a call which is the manager on duty. he was so kind and understanding, he invited us back that day or a later date for store credit. when we went back the same day he remade our order, he was very apologetic and that is great guest service!thank you marvin!"
"this has alot of meat on it, plus the bun is huge... make sure you get alot of arby's sauce. it helps getting all this down the hatch. oh.... and go large!!!"
"go ahead and judge me... i love arby's!all the comfort food i could ask for from roast beef sandwiches to mozzarella sticks and curly fries.whoo!!! can i get a hell yeah?!seriously, i strongly believe the location in alhambra is the best of them all! the food is delicious, scrumptious and (some other word ending in 'ious'). the service rivals well to do restaurants with kindness, friendly check-ins and small talk.granted, it may not initially be your ""cup of tea"" but i challenge you to try any of their sandwiches. i rarely find a cherry coca-cola anywhere which is an added plus for me!i'm about to walk out the door and ring this church bell that will showcase my love and praise!*ringing bells"
i get my mozzarella cheese sticks here. they are so good! i'm so glad that i can come here to get my cheese fix quickly and affordably!
live it just would like one close to my housedrive 5 miles just to get arbyssucks they are hard to find
"there is nothing worse, in my opinion, than listed hours that do not match reality. for saturday night the hours are listed until 11:00 pm. i was truly craving a beef and cheddar. drove all the way here, arrive at 10:35 pm and they close at 10:00 pm according to the window sticker. frustrating."
"amazing service, smiles, and laughs. the food was fresh and looked like the pictures!"
"on rare occasions, i come across people so kind i can't help but wish them a place in heaven. having aspirations to this destination myself, i try to learn what it is about them that makes them so. part of it is wisdom.  but i have met many who's wisdom makes them self inflated and mean. many highly educated in psychology, for example, become too proud of their knowledge of the psyche and abuse it to manipulate others.  wisdom alone is not the answer. the sacred are those who are not only wise but who combine their prowess simultaneously with equal amounts of modesty, and kindness. one such lady is rosa who works as a cashier here at arby's. they are as angels walking amongst us. showing us the way.  blessing us with their presence.  yet, they never look down on anyone. they have found the key to heaven. and so have we, if only we can master this precious lesson.thezekeshow.com"
arby's is always good to have anytime anywhere ha roast beef sandwiches are bomb this place wasn't packed when i went there and the drive through didn't looked to packed as well my food came quick and my order was correct... thanks arby's
i had the gyro and fish. honestly very high quality fish and very high quality gyro. i was super impressed with the sandwiches and the staff were very friendly. tha k you
good food as always. service was decent. the music was loud. the only complaint is. the music was too loud. felt like i eating arby's in a club in hollywood. i was bout to pump my fist.
kept seeing that damn commercial for the triple thick brown sugar bacon half pound club and finally had to have it. perfect post workout meal! bulking season is in!
i usually just get the roast beef and smother it with arby sauce. i love that stuff. it pairs so well. i recently tried their flatbread turkey and roast beef. i personally think the roast beef tastes better. i hate their curly fries. they're way too greasy. i stick to the regular.their cheddar tastes like government cheese. it's gross. tried it once and never again.
i usually pick up arby's in the drive-thru from another location. this is the first time i've been inside one. i got there as soon as they opened and the the location was already open and had a customer (unlike my local fast food places who's hours seem more like suggestions). i ordered and got my food. it was prepared very quickly and all the staff was friendly and even said goodbye to me when i left. it was an overall good experience.
"one of the sandwhiches, a cheesy steak thing, tasted really bad. kind of like soap. the pastrami sandwich was better. price to quality ratio was overall quite poor. but the service was unusually good for a fast food place."
"i have to say that the service i received from the employees here yesterday was great.from a fast food establishment i commend your staff.from beginning to end.great job.to the employee who made my sandwich and the male employee who took my order,you booth did a  was great job,with your politeness and hospitality.the french dip sandwich was made just right,along with the aj's sauce.the side salad was also tasty.arby's still put out a good sandwich.the hospitality was fantastic,again great job.this  is what service is about.when employees enjoy their job,it shows with the service us customers receive and it goes a long way.2015 yelp challenge.085/100"
this arbys is always good and nice workers! they never mess up my order. the mozzarella sticks are the best!! i come just for those
just went thru the drive thru and the cashier was so rude for me asking for extra sauces... jesus you would think he is paying for them out of his own pocket... he's like mama i already gave you sauces count them... as if!!!
"so yeah, finally returned here and more of the same. i ordered 2 beef n cheddar sandwiches and an order of regular french fries. easy enough, right? get home, open the bag, have one order of curly fries, one beef n cheddar and one small plain roast beef sandwich. they confirmed my order twice (and every time i was asked for sauce, i asked for only arby's sauce, and every time the guy repeated, ""so arby's and horsey sauce, right?"") and still managed to screw it up.like joe pesci says, although it was in relation to another food place, it resonates for this one: they f*** you at the drive-thru!"
"i have been a loyal customer at the reseda arby's because of a exceptional general manager, alejandra sanchez......alejandra is a stellar human being and class act.... alejandra sanchez is the ebodiement of integrity!!!!!!......also, every employee at  the reseda arbys followed alejandra's lead in being the most polite, friendly, professional employees any business would be proud of!!!!!!unfortunately alejandra was offered and accepted another job at the topanga canyon, canoga park arby's restaurant which is owned by different owners............(i called over to the topanga canyon arbys to ask a couple of questions and was met with extreme vile rude behavior by the manager joanna and an employee named michelle)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------breaking news:  alejandra is back at the reseda arbys.........great news to anyone or company who is a customer or is thinkng of trying arbys at reseda.i have heard there are new owners at the reseda arbys.......i must suggest and give an admoition to the new owners, to let alejandra do her ""thing""....she is incredible!!!alejandra could and should be working for a ""fortune 500"" company!!alejandra sanchez is a phenomenal class act,  with the utmost integrity and class !!!!!i look forward again to giving all my personal and corperate business to reseda arbys because of alejandra sanchez!!!"
ok first time going to this arbys the food was hot fresh customer service was great a little old arbys but overall was very happy
"arby's is my favourite fast-food chain, because their menu items are so much more interesting than stereotypical burgers, and, the roast beef is of a very high quality. i used to get the roast beef sliders for $1.29 each, but then i discovered the roast beef junior which is twice the size for only $0.40 more. they don't come with cheese, so i get extra swiss for $0.50. arby's mozzarella sticks are the best - much better than the ones at mcdonald's. the curly fries are great also. i always get all three dipping sauces - arby's sauce, ketchup, and the horsey sauce is a perfect compliment to the roast beef.the staff at this location are always very friendly and polite. i do like the 60s kitsch interior design, however, i think this location would see an increase in customer numbers, if the interior was more contemporary, like the arby's in the yucca valley!***go between 2pm and 5pm, and a bunch of their menu items are only $1, including drinks, sliders etc!***"
"i used to love going to arby's. however, tonight wasn't a very good experience. i went through the drive thru so i received my dinner in a bag. i live about 2 miles from this store. when i got home the entire bottom of the bag was drenched in grease. i got grease on my shirt and the sandwich wrapping had it all on one side. the grease was obviously from the potato cakes. the bottom of that container was soaked in grease as well. the top bun of my sandwich had torn in half and it was not a complete bun anymore. so sad to say that i will not be a repeat customer at this store."
"saturday 10:45am, got the classic combo and an unsweetened ice tea. i can't tell you how much i love unsweetened unflavored ice tea. why not drink water, you says? go f yourself, i says. it's lipton, but it's better than water.the super pretty manager at this hour made it so much nicer. i mean, she's like phoebe cates pretty. and so friendly. she wished me a good day as i walked out and it caught me by surprise. in this area, it's not friendly. so a nice gesture like that made a difference. i responded with a reflexive ""blarghy-goo-fay...see ya later."" smooth, brother. smooth.parking is an awful roundabout to nowhere. be sure to park on the north end, since the real entrance is actually before it, if you're going south. the drive thru is where you think the entrance is. but...who cares...phoebe cates is all you should remember."
stopped by today around 3 pm to grab something quick to eat and i must say i was truly impressed by the wonderful customer service the drive thru cashier an asian  guy didn't get his name but i guess it's cashier am 4 really knows what customer service is all about if i could give him more stars i would great attitude and so helpful and happy faces  really need more people like him keep up the great work!!!!
great customer service skills and i love how helpful they were to me and my friend. grand turkey club is an amazing sandwich w/ honey mustard!! it is served hot but next time i will ask for it cold to see how it goes. i was in drive thru so my experience was exceptional and fast. i will be coming back!
"good food, plenty of seating, nice servicewhat more can you ask for?"
"the food i ended up with tasted great, but it's not what i ordered. this 1-star review is for the disorganized management. i asked for their new king's hawaiian nashville hot fish deluxe sandwich. that's a nashville hot fish on king's hawaiian buns with lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, cheese, and ranch dressing.first, they rang me up for a loaded italian and gave me a regular crispy fish sandwich. i reiterated what i ordered, so they brought the sandwich to the back and switched the buns to the correct ones. before even opening it, i clarified that it should be a nashville hot fish, so they brought it to the back once again and switched out the fish. upon receiving the ""fixed order,"" i open it up and notice that it's not deluxe (no cheese or tomatoes). so i ask them to fix their mistake, and ""they do.""of course, when i sit down to eat my sandwich, it's been man-handled 3 separate times and still, they managed to forget tomatoes."
it's arby's... it's delicious. you really can't go wrong with beef 'n cheddars and curly fries.
the manager is awesome his personality and customer service and humor makes me go here every time i am at the mall. fresh food and does not taste as processed as regular fast food. it also is the only arby's i have seen in a mall.
"i would love it if there was an arby's that was not at the mall, but i will go out if my way to grab a sandwich here because i love arby's.  the service is fast and friendly.  the food is good.  i like the market fresh sandwiches and, of course, their awesome curly fries.  the sandwich ingredients are fresh and delicious and there in no such thing as a bad curly fry.no complaints."
"as far as all arby's go the food is all the same. this place is so great and so funny, i work at the mall so i always have food choices in the food court. usually it's sakru japan, thai kitchen, master wok, pizzeria regina or arby's. the way i walk into the food court the sampling people for arby's are always so nice. i think the older dudes the manager i'm not sure but he's so funny and so nice and everyone just great at there job. from what i always see everything they make is fresh to order idk if it's just me or what but i wait just a bit and everything is hot fresh and tasty. i've been at buiser times and they handle it well!"
"sadly, arby's are few and far between in massachusetts.  my closest location in nashua closed and i was seriously craving a reuben with curly fries, so i went on a pilgrimage to the solomon pond mall.there was no line and the girl at the counter was very friendly.  my food was made fresh and quickly.  it tasted fantastic and i was more than full from the medium combo.the prices at arby's are a bit higher than other fast food joints, but i'm happy to pay a little more for the quality and the infrequency.my only slight is that i asked for my drink with very little ice and it included none.  not a big deal and i'm glad that this food court location is a fast enough drive away."
"i went once and i'll never go again.  and i can't believe all the 'good' ratings!  now, i am only judging this place on it's roastbeef, seeing that's their main item.  it sucks!  when i put that roast beef sandwich in my mouth i wanted to puke.  it is the most artificial roast beef i've ever had in my mouth.  it had the consistancy of balogna and tasted like salami.  nasty.  it is the most highly processed roast beef i've ever seen!  you could get better at market basket, their lowest brand. why so many good reviews?  arby's are out west of boston, thank god, and the people out there have no idea what real roast beef is! yuck."
"i wish there were more arby's around in massachusetts.  i have been a fan of theirs ever since i first saw one in colorado in the mid-90s.i love roast beef so that helps a lot.  they are a tad more pricey than other fast food places, but it is worth it in my opinion.  i love the curly fries as well vs. regular fries of other chains.this location loses a star because the service is sometimes meh.  sometimes the employees there just seem meh themselves.  it would be nice if they were friendly and were a bit more helpful to the customer.  i saw one of the employees ignore a woman's questions and she ended up walking away and not buying.  not a good idea if you want your business to succeed."
"i've been to arby's many times before (in florida) this arby's tasted normal, but later made me violently ill. go somewhere else!"
"i was dragged out to the mall on sunday, as sweetie needed things, and we were supposed to be eating at some point afterwards...it took way longer than expected, and the hunger monster started to manifest within me; but before the fangs and hair started to sprout, sweetie darling shoved me in the direction of the food court, and ordered me to ""eat something, for chrissakes!""ugh!  fast food.  but then i looked at arby's menu and they had a turkey ranch sandwich on wheat.  okay.  i ordered it, and then found out that they serve up unsweetened ice tea, too.  score!i'll tell you right now, the sandwich looked like the picture when i got it.  when does that happen?  big, tempting, and a hunk of turkey and bacon in it.  the veggies were crisp and fresh.  red onion, greenleaf lettuce, and tomatoes that were actually red.   i took a bite.  it was really tasty.  what?  it wasn't cheap.  it was about what you'd spend for a good sandwich at a deli or restaurant.  but it was really good.  actually, surprisingly good.what a great and pleasant surprise!"
"fine dining experience.  ok, so i'm not sure why all the arby's restaurants are closing down, but i was so excited to find that this was open and so close to where i work.  obvs, my nostalgia told me to make a beeline straight for the closest arby's and devour a roast beef sandwich (which is exactly what i did).  and boy did that hit the spot.  top it off with some curly fries and you're all set.  what could be better?"
"went there today for lunch, 2 turkey gyros, actually tastes like real turkey!they had a promotion before that was 2 for $6 and i didn't realize they changed it after, i paid almost $9 for my 2 gyros.i politely asked the girl at the counter, what the deal was with that, (not complaining) just wondering if they changed the price.and she said they actually just changed it this weekend, and without asking me went into the cashier drawer and pulled out 2$ and some change...that was awesome, good customer service!and i didn't even have to complain... now if only comcast and other big business worked like that!good training & good etiquette. keep it up!"
"first time coming to arby's and i can honestly say i could've went with out. i tried the loaded fries, and the buffalo ranch chicken tenders and the taste wasn't satisfying at all! i wouldn't recommend coming here for the taste of service! no thank you!"
"got there at 9:15, and the rude girl behind the cash register told me and my kids that they were closed. i told her that her hours say open until 10 she said "" we leave here at 10"".... never knew a restaurants hours reflected what time the crew leaves, and not the time they stopped serving food."
"my boyfriend and i stopped by this location because we were homesick for some arby's, (we moved here from california and haven't had some for a good 6 months and i used to work at an arby's). the food was just as we remembered, definitely worth the trip downtown. the cashier, however was exceedingly rude and apathetic. almost as if our mere presence was the most annoying thing in the world. i get it, arby's is a real grind, but it's not the customer's fault. you don't even have a dining room to clean. and i know for a fact that the shake machine is to be cleaned 15 minutes before closing, not a whole hour and a half before hand (we were also denied a shake). all in all, it really put a damper on our visit and we won't be visiting this location again."
"there used to be an arby's by my house in anaheim, ca- i missed the food, and took a trip downtown to eat here. very stingy with sauce on my smokehouse brisket, and the girl that took my order was apathetic and told me the shake machine had just been cleaned, although it was more than an hour and 15 til close. sad! won't come again, it was extremely disappointing- if you want good arby's, go to cali, or at least not this one."
"i went to the arby's at ogilvie before catching my train. i had the 2 for $6.00 beef and cheddars, along with a small curly fry. arby's is a good restaurant if you'd like a  change up from subway/mcd/bk. i was not in a burger mood, so i went here.i also like arby's chicken fingers. they were my go to menu item back in the day...david putty and i love arby's."
"this small place is like all the way at the end of the food court, didn't even realize it was there... i think their menu items are limited because i did not see some items that i saw on the online menu like the salads or the limited time buffalo chicken slider. the fries tasted burnt and quite hard..."
"dear young woman at the front counter:you know what, honey.  i worked in fast food all through high school and a little beyond, myself, so i understand.  first i know that you are not thrilled to be at work; i can understand that, and even emphasize with you.  secondly, i realize that working there plays hell on the skin.  but what i don't want you to be doing is picking and popping your pimples while taking my order!!!!!!  and then touching my fries!  honey, that's just not cool.thanks,feels bad for youseriously folks, these were not minor pimples either.  these were the big, gushingly visible whiteheads.  i was just horrified there for a moment, and ended up not even wanting the food i ordered.  but since this is the closest to work, and every once in a while curly fries with horsey sauce strike my fancy, i probably will be back.  call me a bitch, but next time, i'm saying something.  besides that, despite the small area in which this place is located, they do a great job with order turnout."
"this review is dedicated to the one and only ed m., lover of arby's.  this arby's is located in the corner of northwest train station (shit sorry!  ogilvie transportation center)  and it is confusing to order and get your food.  there is always a clump of disorganized people and it is hard to tell who is next in line and who is waiting for food.the menu is also a scaled down arby's menu, but for the space they are given, it is fairly robust.  the important thing is that they have my crispy chicken cordon bleu sandwich so i never have to make the painful choice to rid the world of another obnoxious chicken or dine on the succulent swine.  i loathe chickens to the core of my being but it is hard to pick chicken when tempted with swine.  i always get no mayo so i can slather it in horsey sauce.  whoever invented horseradish is a god.  with that said, this arby's never screws up your order.  is it always fast because they want you the hell out of their crappy corner and as a result the food is always hot and yummy grease-a-licious.the only thing keeping this arby's from a 5 star is the fact that it is an arby's and it is a pretty crappy location.give it a try and you will be on your way in under 3 minutes with a pile of tasty hot greasy food!"
"ahh yet another arby's review under my belt!  the great thing about interviewing at temp agencies is that there always seems to be an arby's nearby.  a perfect lunchtime treat that doesn't break the bank.  this location is neat and efficient.  the counter seems a bit small, which could be bad during peak times.   but they fixed my sandwich in no time. by the time i paid my bill my hot and tasty super sandwich was awaiting.  it was hot, fresh and very roast beefy, mmm i'm thinking arby's.  this arby's would also make for an excellent potty stop along your travels.  although the women's bathroom was mysteriously locked the entire time i was there.  i really had to go so i opted for the men's bathroom which was surprisingly clean, although the lighting was very dim and i think i may have peed on the seat.  sorry!  i couldn't see, it's hard to hover as it is already, jeez!"
"i generally don't like fast food, but sometimes it's a necessary evil, and you can only eat at subway so many times before you just have to have some variety. this arbys is set up worse than any other restaurant that i've ever been to.  they're way back in the corner with no great place to form a line to order or to pick up your food.  what a mess.  i think it's because of this mess that the employees here seem rude.  i don't think they realy are rude, but they have to yell and order the customers around because, if they didn't, no one would ever get served.  it's ok, but it's a place that i would only go if i 'had' to."
"oh maribelle how i miss your voice. while some may say it is more of a screech but for me when you uttered my favorite words ""i need a curly"" my heart would warm and my stomach growl with anticipation. yes it is a small location and the place is a little disjointed but hey most of that is the customers fault. there are two types of people in that food court. the corporate people grabbing a quick bite and the hillbillies lemming their way around waiting for their train.  mixing those two is bound to cause some confusion.arbys never did disappoint and i miss my maribelle."
it is mystery meat at it's finest. i have neve seen roast beef that looked like that and drowned in a processed cheddar cheese sauce.
"i had a taste for arby's so i decided to swing into the thompson center for lunch - it was arby's in a food court, nuff said.the thompson center food court is fast food central and there are a handful of options. i choose arby's because you just don't see them around as much as the other places. that, and there's nothing like a beef 'n cheddar sandwich!if you want an idea of what you're getting here just think of a mall food court. the arby's occupies a small ""booth/section"" and there are tables all around. overall i'd say i received exactly what i expected here: i had a beef 'n cheddar and the chicken tenders and both were just fine. i do think the chicken tenders have gotten smaller... but that just reinforces my thesis that arby's, as time goes on, becomes more and more of a rip off (some will remember when you used to be able to get 5 beef 'n cheddars for only $5!).anyway, the food was fine and the staff was friendly and rather quick. my food came out warm and fast and i was eating in no time - the hardest part was finding a table for one during the lunch rush. oh, and there is a bathroom just down a hall from the food court.it's good to know that there is an arby's in the loop (actually, i think there are two...) but i won't be placing this in my regular rotation anytime soon."
we placed a big order for our office birthday treat this month and the whole process was so smooth and easy- everything was made fresh as we waited and they were so kind and accommodating for us. big shout out to denise for coordinating with us. everyone loved it!!
"i stopped into the thompson center to grab a quick lunch.  couple of the restaurants, that i would have normally stop at had extremely long lines.  so i opted to stop at arby's.   you never go go wrong with arby's.i had ordered the classic combo with curly fries, and drink.  within a short time, i had my meal.  everything was hot was it should have.  tasted great.  customer service was okay.would return to grab another roast beef sandwich."
"the store was winding down since the food court was about to close soon. i got a free jr since it was pirate day! they didn't even look at my phone for the promotion code. but the food itself was alright. nothing spectacular. i would prefer to go somewhere else at the food court, but who can argue with free food?"
i have never been a big fan of fast food but i went here this afternoon for lunch. i wanted to try the famous roast beef sandwich. my sandwich was too salty. the curly fries were good. i also got an order of the popcorn chicken which was ok. my partner got the beef with cheddar sandwich which was also salty. guess they are having issues with salt today.not impressed with the place. i would have gone hungry if not for the curly fries. i would rather go to other places in the thompson center.
"the best of the various fast food options in the thompson center.  it's just fast food, but at least it's good fast food.  also, the woman who is manager on duty during lunch is probably the most polite person i've seen working at any of the fast food places there.  she actually knows her regular customers and works to make it a good experience."
"of the fast food options in the thompson center, i prefer arby's. i like arby's for their somewhat all natural chicken breast sandwiches. also, i love them for their bbq sauce. all other fast food bbq sauces pale in comparison to arby's. i like their curly fries as well. this arby's also has fast lunch service. whenever i go there, i'm guaranteed to get my food faster and out of the mess of the food court than all of the other places."
"ok, so if mcdonald's made cheese fries, i would be listing them as my favorite fast food cheese fry fix, but they don't so i'm listing arby's instead. arby's also gets 3 stars alone for their curly fries. rarely do i find a place where i enjoy the curly fries, if not more, than the regular fry option. arby's does it for me on that note. the fries are seasoned with a subtle spice which stands out among all fast food fry joints. they are crisp and crunchy, hot and delicious. you all know you have searched that rectangular box for the perfect, rolled up juicy fry, both soggy and starchy, salty and spicy.what some of you may not know is that you can order a side of cheese to go with these flawless curly fries. it's the same cheese they top their roast beef & cheddar with. standard cheese, mild and cheddary, if not slightly thick. actually, i can't believe i am going to say this, but the arby's curly fry is so good it might not even need the cheese. hold on, let me have this moment. fries, 5. cheese 3. total 3.5 (a three on yelp from me)."
leave it to arby's to make a reuben sandwich bland. most disappointing. won't be back.
no stars. this place is terrible. food tastes like it should. but the blithering idiots they employ have made errors on every single order i have ever placed. i understand it is a franchised fast food restaurant. but pride in your vocation should be paramount regardless of what it is. the attitude of the employees and their apathy towards service is truly insulting and staggering.  i will never patronize this business again.
"as far as true fast food is concerned (which is very rare for me to eat- thanks a lot 'supersize me'), this one takes the cake.  it is located in the thompson center in the lower leveli will admit right now i truly love a regular roast beef sandwich & curly fries.  the secret is to mix the arby's sauce & horsey sauce (yum!) and use it on your roast beef and a dip for the fries.  prepare to be at the gym an extra hour to combat this lunch..."
"i attempted to eat breakfast here on my way to work, took the escalator down to the food court and found that there was no one manning the register.  i called out to the guy in the back, but he was unresponsive and no one took my order or served me up food.  if you're going to sell breakfast, maybe next time man your station!"
"awesome food!!!!!!!!!! the service was excellent. quickly yet quality prepared food. get the limited time bourbon bbq triple stack steak, turkey, brisket, burger!! they have a bathroom too. clean restaurant. arby's sauce is tasty with the horsy sauce."
"i love arby's but this location charges extra for condiments.  at other arby's, i was never charged. i used to go this location but not anymore. after i paid they wanted .50 for a little packet of bbq.....a bit ridiculous.  who carries change on them these days?  i go to the ogilvie location now."
"i had a taste for arby's so i decided to swing into this location for lunch - it was arby's, nuff said.i choose arby's because you just don't see them around as much as the other places. that, and there's nothing like a beef 'n cheddar sandwich!if you want an idea of what you're getting here just think of a small fast food location, that's it. you walk in, right up to the counter, and there are tables all around. overall i'd say i received exactly what i expected here: i had a beef 'n cheddar meal and an extra bnc sandwich.anyway, the food was fine and the staff was friendly and rather quick. my food came out warm and fast and i was eating in no time - the hardest part was finding a table for one during the lunch rush. oh, and there is a bathroom just around the corner but you'll need someone to unlock it for you...it's good to know that there is an arby's in the loop (actually, i think there are two...) but i won't be placing this in my regular rotation anytime soon."
"look, i get it, it's arby's.  why three stars?  i give it one star each for:1. horsey sauce.  delicious. 2. arby's sauce.  less delicious than horsey sauce, but delicious in its own right.3. curly fries. recommend that you dip in (1) and (2)."
i am here now and this place is trash. i downloaded this app just to make a complaint.  i waited(no line) the cashier (evelin) was looking at me like i was lost. she saw me and turned around after seeing me to continue to clean. i'm still waiting and now she takes my order while acting like i am bothering her. took  7 min to get my food. meanwhile two ppl behind me now and she is taking so long that they walk off. not to mention the cashier's friend is standing at the counter talking to her friend on the other side of the counter. this place sucks and i really love arby's.
"customer service and common sense is lacking at this location. i ordered 2 turkery club sandwiches and 2 two curly fries. the young mexican or arab worker placed the sandwiches in the bag in an awkward position, which allowed the juices from the sandwiches to seep through creating a hole in the bottom on my bag. my food fell out and fries were soggy. also, she made no eye contact with me while taking my order and this is the second time, that lack of care was displayed.again, 0 stars"
i don't understand why they don't focus on customer service.  when you say eat here - why do they put it in a bag.  is it too hard to clean the trays?  are they lazy?  should they consider a different caliber of employee?
"awful service dirty place , old food,  i order a new bourbon bacon brisket and rhe bread was old it was like chewy and the people that works there don't even care"
arby's.  need i say anything else?  combo #2 with curly fries and a chocolate shake upgrade always hits the spot.
"i used to love me some arby's. imagine my delight when i found this one open until 9:00. the chicken salad sandwich, i can rock with it. i don't do fast food often but this is a guilty pleasure."
"hooray for horsey sauce!really, that's one of the best things about arby's.  they're one of the only places out there with little packets of horseradish sauce that pair up perfectly with the roast beef sandwiches they serve up here.you just need to make sure you spot the place, as it's still buried beneath the construction scaffolding along wells and probably will remain there for a long time, knowing the construction schedule here in chicago.it remains undiscovered by most, even with a large ""grand opening"" banner under the scaffold that's been there for at least a couple of weeks.  standard arby's fare can be found inside - those roast beef sammiches, chicken sammiches and curly fries and their other food bits.my only dismay with the place is their lack of ""5 for $5"" deals, but that's a franchise thing, not something one can say about a location in particular.  one thing that can be said about this palce in particular is that for some reason, it's always empty.  i'm the only one in there, and as they're in the back, making up my order, i can hear laughing and chatting.  i guess they're not busy or anything, but it's a little off-putting to hear spanish snickering out of sight while you're waiting for your food.  i do understand spanish, but not when it's being whispered or interspersed between chuckles.i can only hope they're not making fun of me.  because all i'm doing is eating arby's.and if that's something that warrants laughter - go ahead and laugh.  because when it's 5 for $5 time, you can bet your ass i'll be back with a backpack and an empty belly craving a pile of roast beef and horsey sauce."
not very clean; not very nice; poor next to most arby's and the new ice tea is terrible.
"first off, i'm very offended by ""anaid"" review. way to slander a business and demonstrate plain disrespect with your foul language.shame on you!i go to this location atleast twice a month. i'm very satisfied with service and order that i receive. they do not charge for sauce, sauce generally comes with your order if that makes sense? with beef, ""would you like any sauce?"" surely, i'll take a few packets! :) workers are generous with sauce packets too. thanks guys!i think said needs to get off his/her high horse and come back to earths ground level. i'll be back soon for beef and cheddar along with loaded curly fries!!"
"i remember this location from the late 60s. back then their beef sandwiches were the best on the southside, 50 years later, their sandwiches are not what they used to be, but still pretty good for a fast food chain. service is always good and prices are reasonable."
"can't go wrong here...try the coke float and loaded fries, order is always right!!!! always leave here happy"
"horrible shitty fucking service. the manager is a bitch. it's supposed to be 24hrs, i waited a good 5 min at the window till the manager told me to fuck off & they were closed. do not go here they give you the nastiest oily ass fries. they some hoes. they charge you 75 cents for arby's sauce."
i just ate half my meal and i'm doing cartwheels it tastes so good everything was perfect i like the size of my sandwich my potato cakes as well as my drink
"mouth-watering mozz stix!it's been eons since the last time i patronized an arby's, and i rarely eat junk food, but lately i have developed a weakness for mozzarella sticks, my fave being from white castle. well a craving hit & with no nearby wc, i ventured through arby's drive-thru to gamble on their mozz stix which come in a 4 or 6 piece pack as opposed to 3, 5, or 10 at wc. it took nearly 5 min to receive my single 4 piece order. i don't qualify that as ""fast"" in my book, but as the woman gave me my bag she warned me to be careful because they were just made & very hot to justify my wait. she was right, these stix were piping-hot indeed & the perfect ratio of crispy breading, just enough to encase the overflowing, ooey-gooey, melty mozz cheese. (i hate when i get mozz stix that are almost all fried shell & little cheese inside). in other words, these mozz stix were worth the wait & the calorie bomb & get 5 gems (can't vouch for the rest of the food here) & were effin' good & give my fave white castle ones a run for their money, and if i'm faced with the 2 drive-thrus side-by-side, i'm gonna be in a pickle!"
everytime i go to this location the shake machine is never in working condition. i will still make the attempt in the future to order from this location out of convenience but it is definitely not a first choice.
great customer service every time! very nice employees which is hard to find these days.
i love arbys. i stop eating at a ton of fast food restaurants but arbys wasn't one of them. however they discontinued the cheese and bacon potatoes triangles. broke my heart.
i'm actually pleased to go through their fast food drive through shavon i believe was her name from the time she took my order you could feel she had a smile. she was very polite and seemed happy to serve you. wish more people had her customer service. good job.
"open 24 hours!  the have the best fast food curly fries, and cheese sticks.they may not be fast, but it always comes out hot and tasty!the staff has always been friendly and make sure you get what you ordered."
one of the few arybs in the chicago area this place always gets my attention when we past by the food not that bad. the roast beef sandwiches arby's serves is delicious and this one is no different. ps they have a drive thru.
"i love arby's and my companion loves tool shopping.  i think i devised the most perfect plan.  we go tool shopping at harbor freight and then we can get arby's from across the street.  i must be a genius.  all went well, i got my beloved super roast beef sandwich.  my roast beef was cold and apparently the worker at the drive in window had very touchy hands.  oh well, this won't really stop me from wanting to try this again."
"arby's is not dead! this location has cleaned up nicely and the food is great. the staff is awesome and i applaud their efforts to make this a welcome, atypical, fast food experience. who doesn't love potato cakes and arby sauce?! yum"
"it is becoming very apparent why arby's locations are dwindling. the customer service here is terrible. if employees aren't yelling across the kitchen at each other then the manager is hanging up on customers. it is clearly a lack of training and management getting this place organized. the wait times are ridiculous, the employees are basically monotone zombies, and the food is under or overdone. how is that even possible at a fast food joint? oh, and don't bother trying to phone ahead. they will just hang up on you. i have seen several cars leave the drive thru and inside customers walk out due to how slow this place is. will not being visiting this hellhole again."
arby's good quick solid food all the time that's not going to break the bank.  brisket sandwich w/bacon ummm ummm good.  the also have a nice variety of different sandwiches and i sure do love their potato cakes (although i didn't get any today)
"i've lived in the area since january and have passed this particular arby's frequently, always wondering why i never see cars in the parking lot or at the drive-thru. now i know. their drive-thru system is archaic and totally insufficient. my order was 100% wrong and i only ordered 2 things."
it was really quiet and not busy. the people were very nice and service was great and fast. ordered buttermilk chicken and curly fries and they were filling. plenty of parking.
"i decided to leave a review because after countless visits i always leave a happy customer. the food is great, always fresh and hot. the service is super friendly, and the washrooms are always kept clean. the manager that works there is a truly nice guy. he is very welcoming and makes sure that everything is always right. looking forward to my next visit!"
my food was great and neatly put together. there was a bit of a wait for it but i wasnt in a hurry. considering everything else is closed at 9 on sunday....its a good pit stop. they have a very interesting drive thru. its on old school lift instead of a window. check out the video i posted!
"if i'm rating the food, 5 stars.if i'm rating the staff, 1 star (and that's generous).the food is, well, it's arby's.  everything you'd expect.  if you like arby's then you know the awesomeness i speak of.as for the staff, well, they're efficient at taking orders and getting food out, but as for a smile, or a greeting, or a thank you, well...  maybe they should pop in to a chick-fil-a sometime and see how happy people present themselves."
"when i go to arby's i always get the roast beef or the chicken cordon bleu.  both are good.  i like the cordon bleu, a chicken sandwich with ham and swiss cheese.  you can't find that anywhere else.  i also like their curly fries and potato cakes.  for a fast food franchise, i really enjoy coming here from time to time."
"went here 2 times during the summer on way out of town for family trip, both times super slow (used drive thru both times...on a fri evening)...the last time the food took 20 minutes (literally) to get and it was cold...worst experience i ever had at an arby's as i love their food...avoid this place. and what's with the ridiculous drive thru setup...almost left my debit card on conveyor belt twice....get a real drive thru window where i can talk to a person face-to-face."
"i only come here when a craving for curly fries strikes.i recommend using the drive thru solely for the experience. it is like and old school bank drive thru. you put your money in a cup in the tray, it comes back with food and change. voila! bonus that you never have to see who is cooking your food. i get a little concerned about the money cup though. every time, i start wondering about all the change and hands that have passed though the cup. for this reason, if you are going to eat and drive, use some purell after getting your change."
"must be careful! don't come to this arby's. there is a credit card cup and i forgot to get it back from the cup and i called the store manager she said will mail it to my house, it ended up my credit card was stolen and used it at different location such as colorado and vegas! i called again and another manager answered that no store policy to mail it back they usually destroy it after 2 weeks. don't trust them! they will sell your credit card to theft!"
"i used to eat here about once a week when i worked in hillside.  we would go late after the lunch rush and it was nice 'n empty for good 'n beefy roasted beef sandwiches.  part of the reason we'd go here was we we could get away from the hectic workplace and chat.  that would be the only reason this arby's sticks out in my mind, and it's clean.and, i love their potato cakies!"
"i and my cohorts diesel and capone are always impressed with dog friendly places to eat. although we have been to arby's several times, my husband and i hit the drive-thru cause d&c were riding with us.nick our order taker loved our doggies and then proceeded to give them each a tiny bowl of roast beef. nick - diesel and capone thank you from the bottom of their canine hearts.arby's - good job hiring nick!!!!!!"
"i knew what to expect (food wise) when coming to take my lunch break here but whoah, the atmosphere was terrible. no motivation what so ever from the staff, constant arguing, not just bickering, arguing, voices being raised. no respect between manager and her crew. reprimanding staff in front of customers is very unprofessional, the staff lacked motivation to begin with. not sure what started the bitterness but definitely ruined what should have been a calm lunch break. what an unprofessional and awkward experience."
"i always make sure to come to this arby's when i'm in the area. the service here is always fast and nice! i usually receive my food after a couple minutes in the drive through, which isn't bad at all! keep it up!"
i wish they had more arbys. i love arbys more than anything. one time my daughter tossed a filthy sock in the oven and messed up our stove. we needed dinner so arbys saved the day. go to arbys now. eat a sandwhich .
"i like arby's.  i know a lot of people may not and i don't eat it but once every year, but when i do, this is the location i do.  there aren't many left.  you either like arby's or you don't, lol!"
"there are so many places in chicagoland you can go for a better beef sandwich, although arby's offers roast beef instead of italian beef.  i go for the chicken cordon bleu sandwich, which i get a craving for from time to time.  it's a chicken patty topped with ham and cheese with mayo on top.  overall, it's a typical fast food place with fast food taste that offers roast beef sandwiches instead of burgers."
"well, against my better judgement i ate their new bbq beef on a hawaiian bun sandwich. that was a week ago and i am still sick. i am sure the greasy curly fries didn't help. never again...don't risk it. either the food isn't kept at the proper temperature, they don't clean properly or their grease is old. i had stomach cramps so bad i nearly went to the hospital. luckily, it is getting better. never again."
they rebuilt this place from the ground up a few years ago. they should have just cut their losses. i had 2 beef and chedders with fries.  as i was eating i thought that the cheese tasted a little funny. i had never had one before so i thought that maybe it was just me. nope. i was as sick as a dog later that night. you get what you pay for. this is my last review for an arby's.
"ehh if you're looking for something quick and don't care much about taste, you should try out this arby's. service was great, started ordering and needed to make a phone call because they were out of something, they tell me to take my time and let them know when they're ready. i finally get back to them and within minutes, my order is ready. i get home and open up my order, my god it stinks really bad. that bacon and beef cheddar sandwich was lopsided, all the cheese was on one side, the meat was on the other side and the bread was just falling apart. this was actually my first time trying arby's and after this, i don't think i'll ever try anything from arby's."
"generally speaking, i do not eat fast-food, however, arby's has a special place in my heart due to childhood memories. anyway, i came to this location due to convenience and i will say it will be my last time. their shakes look like throw-up! not even frozen or some sort of thick consistency comes out like pure liquid. the curly fries - pure grease. i am aware that fries are unhealthy, fatty, and cooked in oil, however, my fries were not hot, and oozed oil. when i had asked for extra arby's sauce & horsey sauce i did not receive it - found out when i came home, sadly. besides the terrible food, the customer service also lacked -especially when i had called their number to speak to someone regarding my disatisfaction, no one would answer."
i've never had a problem coming here but best believe i most likely won't be back at this location again. they messed up our order and then said we never said it change the order after the lady said yeah to our change and then don't do it and then go back and supposed to get the right order and they still manage to mess it up...
"tried the ""gryos"" and they were not good. double the bread... half the meat ""we have the meats"" is that a thing? i got 1 or 2 onions. i tried 1 turkey and 1 regular and they also put lettuce on there. wherever gryos are from should burn these. curly fries are good."
"come now... it's arby's, not really changing.  but, it was clean and the manager helped me find some items that weren't on the menu ... yes, items that are not on the menu behind the registers.  my market fresh sandwich was exactly what i was looking for and the fries were curly, but the box was not just filled with that one big fry.  these things have me returning when the arby's crave strikes again in the near future."
"what's worse than a nagging fast-food taste bud craving, only for it to be later shattered? crushed? left completely unsatisfied?  frustrated?  and still hungry.....?well, if you want to know what it feels like, i recommend coming here!here's the deal.  i was in elmhurst running errands (on a short time line, i might add) ...so i dashed into fannie may to grab some yummy chocolate gifts.  my stomach was growling, and lo and behold sushi time across the street was in clear sight....calling my name.  yes!  sushi!  sounded wonderful....until...i walk up to the front unlocked door with a ""closed"" sign hanging and 4:00pm time to ""reopen""...it was 3pm...i just missed it!  apparently, they were on break...as i peeked my head in, only to double check and be told ""yes, we're closed until 4pm"".....so...i graciously walked out, got back in car and drove...and drove...until..the arby's sign grabbed my attention.  i've passed this arby's countless times...but for some reason on this special day, it really wanted me to notice its existence.  it was a no brainer.  my taste buds were screaming ""go to arby's!""...my voices were telling me ""its ok to eat arby's....you haven't had it in years!  go for it!"" and so i did....it was the easiest and fastest decision in decision making history....of course i wanted the roast beef...so i place my order at the drive-thru and ask for it plain..i get the meal deal with fries plus an order of onion rings for a friend...i repeat my order, making sure they know i don't want anything on my beef sandwich except beef - no cheese, no sauce, no nothing..i'm told ""yes, it is plain""...i also repeat the fry and onion ring...""yes, we have that""...i get to the window and again ask (call me anal..) ""is there an onion ring in the bag too?""  and you guessed it, i'm told ""yes, its in there.""  i'm all excited about reuniting with this sandwich again....until....i get to my next destination....i only have minutes to eat before leaving for my next stop and i don't like eating in the car.  i usually like to savor my meals.i recklessly open the bag, get the sandwich out...and waaa waaa waaa....yep, there's an onion ring in there, but no fry.  my roast beef is doused with cheese and q-sauce...i was super hungry so i ate half - void of any gusto......this goes in my book of gusto-less mangia-ing experiences (hate those...).mind you...there were no cars in the drive-thru when i arrived.  actually, as i drove off, i noticed about 4 cars behind me....hmm...wonder if their orders got messed up too...how the hell can you screw up an order after repeating it three times?  a simple, small order during non rush hours?and why do i get the feeling that regardless of the # of times i repeated my order, the employee could really care less?  never bothered to double check?based on other reviews here, they've been doing it since 2013!this location needs to get its shite together!  and the worst part?  you know when you crave something and it goes so wrong that it takes years for you to crave it again?  well....i just entered the arby's fear zone...."
"i ordered the smokehouse brisket and it was very good. without getting to deep into it, just suffice it to say we got above and beyond customer service from shonda. i hope she gets the recognition she deserves for her caring for the customers."
"i was pleasantly surprised.  not being a huge fan of fast food; i wasn't looking forward to having lunch here.  however, i had the ruben sandwich and my friend had the turkey sandwich.  both were good and reasonably priced.  had the curly fries, but they weren't as good as i remeber they were ... how did i miss the jalapeno bites!?as of this writing there are ninety-six restaurants in elmhurst.  i plan on eating at, and reviewing, every one.  follow me on yelp!"
"had a turkey ranch sandwich. did not look, smell or taste good. after about 1/2 way done eating i became nauseous and had diarrhea the rest of the day. now this place is better than an enema. you eat, get sick and cant get off the toilet. thank you arby's.i give an f - rating"
"they've found little ways to screw up my order (e.g. not giving me horsey sauce or bbq when i've explicitly asked for it, giving me marinara instead of ranch) as well as much larger ways (forgetting my shake, giving me curly fries instead of potato cakes).  very few things on their menu are $1.00 or less; prices here are much higher when compared to other fast food places like bk, wendy's, tb, mickey d's, or sonic.the newly-touted smokehouse brisket sandwich was actually pretty good.  it was dry and looked like it had been sitting out for a while (cheese was hard--ew), but the flavor wasn't bad.  was it worth $7.50 for a combo meal?  probably not.  the jamocha shake is yummy, though."
i was disappointed the last time i was there. the fries were soggy. they just refried the  fries that they have previously fried. that's the reason they were soggy. i like my fries to be fried only once. curly fries is what drew me there. not anymore unless they are fried only once.  manager please tell this to your employees. i want to come back and enjoy my curly fries.
i don't like their main food. i just like their dessert turnovers and orange cream/chco mint shakes.
"i normally try to avoid fast food but arby's came out with a blt which is one of my favorite sandwiches so i really wanted to try it. didn't have high expectations but was pleasantly surprised. when i have a blt i usually have bread that's toasted, but their sandwich wasn't and i actually liked it that way. the bread was quite substantial and tasty and not just a plain, bland white bread. i had a side of onion rings that were also quite good, although perhaps breaded a little heavier than i normally prefer. wife had their specialty chips - she liked them. when i get another taste for a blt, no question that i will come back."
"since my unsatisfied experience, i've received a phone call from the manager of this location and an envelope in the mail with two free combo coupons.  not what i expected, that's what customer service should be like.  good job arby's."
"i was craving arby's for a week, but there are no locations near me. i was not far from this restaurant while running errands and decided to stop in. the place was clean and the staff was friendly. the food was just ok. my sandwich was luke warm as were my potato cakes. it really sucks when you've been looking forward to something for so long and it let's you down. i will go back, because hopefully it was a one time mishap."
"the food is good for arby's but they always forget that little something...straw, napkins, sauce, spoon. it is very frustrating to count on a quick sandwich on the way to work and not have a straw to sip your drink or a napkin to wipe your hands. say what you want about mcd's, but they don't have these problems because they get it right, that's why they are always on top"
"worst arby's in the country. somehow, for over the past three years now, they managed to maintain a perfect record of messing up every single order."
"got to admit, this joint was the cleanest arby's i've been in, maybe because it was early.  i had a dr.s appoint. in the area, so i decided to have an early lunch.sandwich was fresh and tasty."
"im convinced this arbys hired the nicest middle aged women in the chicagoland area. the service here is always the best, i stop here about twice a week after class to eat & every single time the ladies treat me so well. love it here."
"the food i have no problem with, but the service here is absolutely horrid! there were 2 cars ahead of me and it took the 20 minutes to serve two cars. and when i got to the window, it took them 2 minutes to give me back my change : 6¢!! a nickel and a penny and it took them 2 minutes to give it back. plus i had to wait another 3 minutes for my food. 25 minutes all together for 2 french dips."
"could take it or leave it....its o.k.  long wait times in drive through..oh, and remove the fake flowers by the stop sign already.   if anything, move the flowers to the cart corral by jewel where they should really be."
ordered a double beff and cheddar. the gave me a bun with only 3 slices of veef. no cheese at all. spent $10 for a very small sandwich. this place is a big rip off
i had a great experience at this location. very clean and everyone was very friendly!
only get 3 stars because of the guy working the drive thru went inside to place an order because i had two coupons.  my mother placed an order in the drive thru using one i went inside to use my debit card for one the ditz behind the register walks up with dish soap up her arm should have walked out but she was not going to bag my order yet just take it.  i go to pay and she tells me there was a problem with credit card machine.  i tell her to cancel the order and go out and tell my mother the guy in the drive thru rings it up and has no problem taking my debit card the girl should have thought to have him do that.
"great service !! very friendly people, the food is fast food but i must say thumbs up for the delicious food."
"the guy nathan who took my order at the drive threw, was super professional, awesome personality, and great customer service. the mozzarella sticks i ordered needed to finished and he let me know that it would be a couple mins and i thought that was great because most places just let you wait and not explain anything that is going on. because of this great employee i would come back."
"add arby's to the ranks of white castle and taco bell. it's been a year since i went to the oak lawn arby's and got a nice colon wash out. now add this one to the banned list. i ate two roast beef sandwiches for lunch, and my $%@ exploded by 3pm.unbelievable. i almost never get diarrhea this bad. what's the phone number for the hickory hills health department?of course, again, other reviewers had given this place a few clear warning signs."
"it's fast food so i don't have high expectations. i hope for my order to be hot, correct and semi-fresh. i got none of the above. came here after a long day of work and just wanted something quick. always enjoyed their curly fries growing up but they were cold and dry. the chicken was cold and dry as well."
"after working a 12hr shift my family asked me to pick up some arbys on the way home, i sat in the drive thru for nearly, 15mins.  besides that got the food home and the beef was extremely dried out... so i decided to call the store and ask the store manager john on duty... he was rude and hung the pan up one me after i stated it was the worst food ever from this place asked  is i could bring my food back, and get money money back again the wise ads guy hung up... funny how my family and friends  previously worked there and yet it was never like that muchless a lack of respect towards a paying customer that pays their check weekly by all the customer that walk-in the door... never again will i ever attempt to go to that location and yes i will contact the store manager whom i know still works there and yes i will be contacting corporate mr. john i sure as hell hope that maybe when u get a job u might want to get the facts straight customers are always right.   and to hang up extremely immature..."
"went here, ate, went to sleep. wokeup at 5 in the morning with horrible stomach pain amd a rapid heartbeat. i ran to the bathroom & didnt throwup. ive had an aching stomach pain alllll day along with a fever and swollen abdomen. do not eat here."
"overall this location is hit or miss based on the employees working at the time. i work night shift and sometimes stop here in the early morning hours. one employee in particular, melvin (according to our receipt) is one of the best workers you could come across.  he is always friendly and in a great mood. it's contagious and puts me in a better mood everytime. he gets the order perfect and never forgets sauce. not very often do you see a fast food employee that excels at their job. if i knew how to contact management about him i would."
"as queen once sang ""another one bites the dust""i don;t eat fast food all that much.  if i hit up a major fast food chain three times a month, it is a lot for me.  more and more i am eliminating these types of places.  let me rephrase this by saying that they are eliminating these places for me.i was running late last night and i needed to grab  quick bite somewhere.  i decided to go to the drive thru.  there we only three cars in front of me so i thought that i wold be in and out in no time.  it took me exactly 25 minutes to get through here.  i receive old fries and a cold sandwich and an attitude. arby's is now one of the chains that i am officially boycotting!"
this arbys been here many years and parking lot and inside is forever empty .i think there best thing is deli sandwiches.roast beef is of poor to barely fair quality.its very expensive for fast food quality doesn't match pricing .usually when i eat here i regret it.pity one would think that there signature item would be outstanding .. not at all.many other places to chose from .
"with the huge ad campaigns arby's has been running lately i had high hopes for this very rare visit to one of their ""restaurants."" what a disappointment. first, let me say that the service here was fast and friendly. i had no issue with the service at all but the food leaves alot to be desired. when you buy a meal from arby's expect to get overpriced lunchmeat. thats all it is. i had their new cheddar bacon beef sandwich with curly fires and the sandwich was small .. nothing like the photo and just not tasty at all. it had no flavor whatsoever. it s was not even as good as a premium roast beef cold cut you could get at any decent supermarket. the curly fries, however, were phenomenal. they were piping hot right out of the fryer. unfortunately, the fries werent enough to earn this place more than a one star review. i think the only thing id ever get from here again would be the fries. big thumbs down for arbys as a whole."
"slow, poor service. waited 15 minutes at the window and they forgot my fries. i thought this was fast food."
"updating my review - apparently carmen is no longer here. reportedly, she was a bit abrasive with some customers; which is a shame for the customers and for carmen. i hope she gets her act together and get back on her feet.this arby's is still the only one outside of the far-reaching philadelphia mills, and i'm grateful to have an arby's that is accessible from center city. my recent visits bear out that the food is served right and it's served hot. and from what i can see, the staff works hard at serving up your goods.the crowd and the environment in this section of the city are a little rough, which apparently is why they have secure door locks on the bathrooms. and sometimes the tables aren't cleaned up as quickly as they should be.but it's still a 4-star from me; they do pretty good here."
"got to give this place 3 stars. i drove a half an hour to this store because i just had to have arby's. went there today saturday about 1230pm.  ketchup machine not working.  no soap in the mens bathroom.  food wasn't hot enough. went to ask for more napkins, lady just handed them to me without a word.  at least i said thank you very much as she just walked away.  i was the only customer in the store.  hoping i'll have better luck next time."
"i went to arbys on 2560 aramingo avenue on 1/22/17 i had the worse experience their with the manager carmen.  i see that she has a nice review but she is not a doll. she is a rude, obnoxious women who needs management courses and some more education.  i went to place my order and because i did not say ""may i order"" she made me state my order three times.  however, i stated "" yes i would like ____"" what is wrong with that? the next customer who was a teenager very quiet and mannered asked for a sliders and she did the same game.  after the third time she sucked punched him in the chest saying boy you were raised better than that.  the teenager did not answer her he just pleasantly placed his order.  even if you know this teenager you have no right to touch a customer.  finally i got my food and she placed it in a bag which was fine.  carmen states oh that was for here.  i stated that is okay no it is not okay she screams and placed it on a tray.  no problem i proceed to eat my meal.  the teenager and his friend sat behind me very quiet.  they had a friend who met them and she was rude to him. now four more kids entered and she begins yelling at them to get out.  the girl says why what did i do? she is still yelling from behind the counter at the girl.  finally she comes over to the table yelling and pointing at the girl.  the girl is still asking why are you yelling?  lets go outside! at this point i stated why are you yelling at them? they didn't do anything wrong.  she begins yelling in my face this is her restaurant and you are not here every day to see what they do.  she then calls the girl a ""whore"". this is very unacceptable.  i was so upset i left my food right there.  i could not believe this woman did this in a restaurant to a child.  whether the kids did something last week or not that was unacceptable give them a chance.  this was so ghetto i will never go back here again.  i will travel 30 minutes to the arby's in feasterville where the management and staff are pleasant and not trashy."
"~this was the first time someone at a drive through asked how my day was going. i appreciated that, & initially came there for the 2 for 6$ gyro deal. i didn't realize the gyros would come on wraps rather than actual flatbread, although still quality ingredients for fast food restaurant & friendly staff!the don approves of this establishment & will be back~"
"this review is for take-out only.  i had been having cravings for arby's when i realized that i haven't eaten there in over a decade.  in my first year of college, i would eat their chicken fingers and curly fries every day.  i don't know if this is location specific or not because that one was in willingboro, nj and was always on point.however, the arby's on aramingo ought to be brought on trial for war crimes for serving this putrid, disgusting food.  the chicken fingers consisted of mostly batter and the fries tasted like vomit.  i have a stomachache and will probably have to make myself throw up so i can eat something else."
"if i could give this place a lower rating i definitely would. i live nearby and have made the unfortunate decision to hit up this arby's drive-thru a handful of times. each and every time i've visited this location they have messed up my order in some type of way. whether it be missing items, different items all together, or some type of combination of both, this arby's location has yet to succeed at giving me the correct order.as for the food quality, i'd say there's a 50/50 chance that your food will be very poorly made, cold, or taste unpleasant. if you enjoy gambling or like the excitement of receiving a mystery bag of food, then this place is for you! if that's not your style than i highly suggest passing this place up and opting to eat somewhere else, anywhere else!"
"i don't go here often but doubt i'll ever go back. i just went through the drive-through and had an annoying experience. ordered a tenders meal and unknowingly to me, i was charged an additional $1.50 - when she asked what size i said medium and apparently the price on the board is for the ""regular"" but the employee never said it was more expensive. then got the wrong drink. and asked for catsup and didn't get any at all. plus the attendant had zero customer service skills."
"went on a saturday afternoon during their ""happy hour "" when slider sandwiches, small fries and drinks are just $1.00. i could hear the management in the back complaining about something being wrong with the system and they also seemed to be short staffed as well.  order the fries, drink and a roast beef, corned beef, ham, and chicken slider. each item was hot and very tasty.  i was surprised at the amount of meat that came on each slider. well worth the regular price of $1.49 but even better at $1.00. i didn't have to wait long for my food and for whatever issues they had in the store, my service overall was great! the management and employees worked double time and that won me over. i definitely will be back and recommend this location!"
"i don't know if it was this location or what, but, i finally got the roast beef a few weeks ago. a little bit over-rated. atleast the horsey sauce (horseradish) made it better."
"i only go here for the roast beef single with au-jus (on the side) sause.mucho parking, great a/c on hot days and young & hip employees."
"incredibly clean; including the restrooms!okay, so i hate any establishment that is associated with ""fast food"". but, my coworker and i only had 20 minutes before we had to return to work. so, we went to arby's.1. the establishment is practically spotless. the only issue i could have complained about is some customer threw a napkin in one of the plant boxes.2. the service was 100% better than chik-fila (which is right across the street). unfortunately i forgot the young lady's name who served us, but she made me feel like i was dining at a high-class establishment. she smiled, repeated our order, and even told us a timeframe of when we should pick it up from the counter (3 minutes). we timed it, and it was 2 minutes 34 seconds.3. the food was clean. have you ever had something fried and instantly you knew the grease was dirty or old or bad? not here. the food was so fresh. i had the turkey and bacon on multigrain. perfect and hand made-to-order. my only complaint was the onion rings. my coworker had those instead of fries. the onion rings are awful. i feel it's the brand arby's uses; they remind me of sonic's, which are nothing but batter and onion powder.i am very picky about where i eat. i will have to say, i'll be making weekly visits to this establishment."
"if you like bacteria with your roast beef, look no further! don't try any sauces here. there's a fly infestation, probably from no one ever actually cleaning where the sauce comes out. same goes for the soda machine, where the lids and straws are too. imagine what the grill looks like in the back!i won't even get into how ignorant the cashier was, after walking in and every employee was hiding in the back for five minutes. how does that even happen?anyway, go get taco bell or something next time. sheesh!"
always clean and rarely crowded... the staff is always friendly and the food is always good!  much better than the chik-fila and sonic right across the parking lot.
"i like arby's it's a nice change from standard fast food and reminds me of the old roy roger's chain. i with they had a roast beef that came with lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickle by default but these folks always accommodate me when i ask for it. the potato cake side is like a huge tater tot, so extra points there. never crowded, has unsweetened iced tea, and service is pleasant if slow (they never have potato cakes ready)."
"we love coming here, it's the only close by arby's in philly. i love the classic roast beef & cheddar. it's my thing  i appreciate their ""all the meats"" campaign but i'd like them to stick with their specialty. the new gyros are decent, same for reuban & some pricier specialty sandwiches. this location is always clean, nice people, good food. they let you use multiple coupons sometimes (otherwise is kind of expensive for fast food). i just wish they had a customer restroom!"
"after going to capital grille last night, i decided to save some money and go to arby's. i really thought i was going to be in for a bad experience, but truly it was not that bad. i went with the mild chicken fajita sandwich on flatbread. it was really good. it had tons of flavor provided by the delicious peppers and flavorful chicken. it also has a creamy avocado sauce. the chicken was full of flavor and was not rubbery at all. it tasted nice and grilled. the cheese went well with the sandwich. i wish that they did not include the tomato or lettuce. the sauce was pretty much flooded on the sandwich so i wish they toned it back a bit. the staff was welcoming and kind. however, i'm not sure the restaurant was taken care of too well as the condiments table was a little dirty and the lids were not falling out of their compartment the restaurant looked above average for a fast food joint. the seats and tables looked fine and they had a soda machine that looked new. the restaurant is fine with some tasty food, but i doubt i would return unless they have another crazy promotion. it is very unhealthy and is filled with fat and sodium."
they always forget stuff we got some sweets from arby's we dint have it they said they did put in there they didn't
hubby wanted a roast beef so i went to arby's.  the drive thru service was quick and accurate.  hubby enjoyed his sandwich.  the inside is small but appropriate for the area.  plenty of parking il def go back.
i agree with blake. a great restaurant . food is tasty. good service with friendly staff.
"somehow, we always end up at this arby's location at some point during any sunday. the food has always been consistent, and the service quick. this location still has offers printed on the back of the receipt (currently a free 12 oz shake or turnover with the completion of a satisfaction survey) so make sure you complete the offer and redeem it before you leave! quick and tasty food, great service; make sure you ring the service bell on your way out!"
"yes, it's fast food, but, occasionally when out shopping, we will stop for lunch at a fast food venue. arby's has always been a favorite since i was a little girl. been to this location a few times and it was good. both had the classic roast beef and cheddar cheese platter which includes those tasty fries and a beverage of choice. no, arby's does not have coca-cola products, but, they do have soda water and i drink it aka seltzer water, sparkling water. the staff was friendly and we were served quickly on a busy saturday. will go again to get the all-time favorite. they do have specials like the corned beef sandwich around st paddy's day, and also offer other meat sandwiches ie chicken, turkey....."
all the booths were dirty as well as the floor and the drink area. coffee was not fresh and had grinds in them. fries were cold. my dad's name is gene but the geniuses working here spelled it jean. the 2 for $6 gyros were fresh and tasted good.
"i've seen way too many arby's smokehouse brisket commercials today that we had to go try it...  it's not bad at all but i can do without the mayo on the sandwich.  arby's curly fries, i love them."
consistent food! this is a must for me. there food is always fresh and tasty. they have no problems customizing your order and do so with a smile. i'm a beef and cheddar gal but also enjoy the market fresh turkey club.
"late snack or main meal arby's has been at this location serving those needs for over 40 years. it's not fancy,  a good roast of beef sandwich does not have to be. italian weddings have existed on them and roast pork for decades here in delaware county,  sorry, you'll only get beef, here.they have a better fry than a few of their competitors.  holidays bring the specials, lent brings the fish; the aroma brings the crowds. once a month we are among them. eating one of the best bargans on the golden mile."
"came to this location by chance, not very busy so there was no wait. staff was friendly and prompt.  ordered a number 6 got it to go and as i was walking out the cashier came out to me to bring me my fries.  they forgot to put it in the bag.  i appreciated that very much because i did not check the bag before i left. food was good."
"rickety/wobbly tables, not friendly employees (except the , served cold fries, diet coke fountain not working. no wonder this place is empty at 1pm in a weekday. the roast beef sandwich was good though."
"this is what i got, apparently these guys got too much time on their hand.if this is how they serve food and think it's funny.  avoid this place."
"i'm here to report that the little flowers on the tables mentioned in the other review are now gone. there really isn't much here to distinguish this arby's anymore, except maybe that the bell is still here. the servers weren't too friendly, the bathrooms weren't too clean, and in general i liked arby's food much better 15 years ago."
"i only write reviews i feel strongly about.just got the ""bacon club"" & felt it worth a mention.this sandwich was amazing! some of the bacon was sweet with a bbq flavor- some of the bacon wasn't-it was just normal bacon.put it all together and with the sauce & lettuce & tomato in the sandwich is a bacon lovers dream come true! you gotta try this! all of the bacon was cooked perfectly - not too crispy (perfect)! & not undercooked & fatty! like i said - was amazing! hope i get the same cook next time, cuz this was my first time.dont know how they do things - hopefully it all tastes the same! this is just my opinion, but if you love bacon, i really think you'll love this sandwich!"
"i have been here twice.  the dining room was empty on both occasions that i visited.  i have to give it to arby's, they take the prize for having unique fast food dining room attributes.  i remember visiting the arby's in delaware on kirkwood highway, it had a big screen tv and fireplace.  that seems pretty random and atypical to the usual fast food restaurant dining room.  you take notice more often than not when a fast food joint does something different than the regular tables and chairs.... and nothing else.  this arby's has cute little flower arrangements on every table . the flowers are fake, but who cares, they put forth the effort.  there is also a big bell by the front door with a placard above it that states something to the effect of:  ""ring bell if your received great service.""  nice touch.other fun features of this arby's include the overly loud drive thru speaker so when i am dining in the restaurant i can overhear every single person ordering on the drive-thru lane.  have they ever heard of headsets?  what happens when some drunk crazy person pulls up to the drive-thru speaker and begins to shout out obscenities?  that could possibly create an uncomfortable situation for the soccer mom and her kids.the food is good, it's arby's.  just like every other arby's, they have a great track record of being consistent throughout their brand."
there's a reliable wawa one mile away
"when you are out with a 3 year old, you'll try almost anything....lol,,in this case, we wound up at arby's..... this place should get 5 stars for it's cleanliness and friendly staff... the food, to be completely honest, wasn't bad at all. hot and freshly made..... what came in the kids meal should require an engineering degree to put together... so many small hole and those rediculous picture directions.. good thing that she eats very slow, or else it would have wound up in the trash.. all in all, not a bad place to visit... when i initially started this review, i started with 2 stars..... after thinking about the place and how starved we are for decent fast food eating options, i changed it to 4 stars for not being mcdonald's, burger king, or taco bell....."
"save your money, i know it's only arbys but all these commercials showing they now have real meat and not that stamped out roast beef they try passing off as real meat! today me and my girlfriend went to get a new bourbon beef brisket sandwich,  well the meat does look like its real and it didn't taste bad but it was cold, now what we ended up getting didn't look anything like the picture! there was 4 little pcs of beef, 1 pc of bacon broke in half and literary 4 french fried onions the cheese again was ice could and it had very little sauce on it.2 sandwiches for $12.00 bucks, they almost had us but again we left thinking it's the same old arbys,  i don't know why they can't just sell real roast beef sandwiches, this is why the store is always empty they try telling you they have the beef and they charge you like its real but it's the same old food. smh"
"i went in with an appetite for quality food, and left with the most dejected feeling i have ever experienced. i ordered the roast beef sandwich which i anticipated to include some sort of accessories on it, like cheese. instead, i was greeted with a deli quality sandwich that had the saddest slice of roast beef i have ever seen, and the arby's sauce did much to help the fact. also i prefer my curly fries less curly, as in french fries. iced tea was good and so was the service, considering the place is always dead. i would suggest considering an actual quality fast food chain like mcdonalds if you want edible food."
