"buffalo wild wings has great wings, but otherwise the rest of the menu is just so-so.  tonight the service was awful.  as soon as we told our server we only wanted water, we were pretty much ignored for our entire visit, and the server gave us the absolute minimum of service.it took over 10 minutes for her to bring us our water, and take our orders. my son ordered the mac & cheese with milk.  he also asked if he could have the milk warmed.  the server wasn't sure they could do that.  she suggested she could give him a cup of hot water, and he could put the cup of milk in the hot water to warm it.....my wife ordered traditional chicken wings with carrots and i ordered boneless wings with celery.  the wings were delicious.  the carrots did not look at all appetizing. when i asked the manager about it, he explained that they get bags of dry carrots and soak them in water before serving.  our carrots just hadn't soaked as long as some carrots.  a longer soaking would have made them look better, apparently.finally, we asked for our check and again it took over 10 minutes to get our check."
"service was poor like all the other reviews say. i went with a friend and niece. asked for her water and my water with no ice and we had confirmed our drinks before she left and still brought her water with ice (no biggie). i asked for my sandwich to have jalapeños in it, and it came without it. then when she came back, i asked if i can get jalapeños on the side now and she said okay but brought back the jalapeños when i had 1/4 of my sandwich left (still charged us). she asked if i wanted anything else and i asked for some tartar sauce on the side, and she said i'll bring it right now and i never got that. anyways, fish sandwich combo was $12 and it was average (mcdonald's is better). my friend got the sweet shrimp dish which was also $12 with no sides and thought it was just okay."
"this establishment is bigger, brighter, and cleaner than the average bww. we were seated immediately on a tuesday at 7pm, when the restaurant was at about 80% capacity. our waitress was new but she got our order correct, and food was served in about 10 minutes. the mango habanero traditional wings were slightly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and our fries dusted with chipotle bbq flavor came out as expected.overall, the service and quality was the same (if not better) than other bwws. judging from the other reviews, this place either has some consistency issues or recently got much better at service. i would come again."
"i like this location, it's very clean and the staff is quick to fill online orders. i placed an order for a few baskets of wings and fries, and it was ready to go by the time i got there. as always, it was delicious!definitely try the asian zing!"
dirty bathroom. dirty bar. no management. dirty dishes left all over bar. what's going on here?
"so far the slowest service ever. looks like they have more than enough employees but it took over 20 minutes for a waitress to come see us. if i didn't stand and approach one of the staff, no one would have come seen us. as much as i like the food, service here makes me want to avoid this place totally."
"very poor service. went in with my family of 3 and waited for a few mins till a hostess showed up. then a family of 4 was behind us, and the hostess told us that they were cleaning a booth for us, while the hostess then seated the family of 4 to a table that was clean. didn't really understand why they had to clean a booth when clearly there were many clean tables. after we had been seated, we waited for a waiter to come give us a menu or greet us or anything, but nothing at all. just one of the workers who decided to leave some napkins and straws and silverware and that was it. my family and i decided to wait for 15mins to see if anyone would attend us. and nothing, so we decided to leave."
"very bad service , waiters seemed in a rush to just get back and chit chat with each other . food quality was not that great , the wings were really salty . they servers spoke with an attitude and got irritated if you asked for something and i asked for a cup of water took forever to get and the store wasn't even busy . honestly i wouldn't recommend service here sucks and i don't trust eating at a place with service that isn't top notch and waiters seem so distracted with one another only ."
omg this korean bbq flavor!! i hope it's here to stay; not spicy but bits of chili flakes enveloped in a sticky sweet sauce.
usually bbw has pretty iffy service. but this one was great the waiter was super prompt and the food came out at a reasonable time. normally it takes an incredible amount of time to get your food but this was perfect. naturally the asian zing and garlic parmesan sauces were delicious. and fries super tasty.
"the worst ever buffalo wild wings on earth or lets say the universe.i cannot believe the fact that they actually have the audacity of running business with these kind of ethics they got which we experienced of pure negligence and ignorance totaling 45 plus minutes of wait for somebody to come ask us for drinks or even hand out the menus after being assigned a spot to sit on a weekday with pretty much 80 percent of restaurant being empty at the time me and my family went and even after getting an attention of a server just walking by we were not handed out menus neither nobody again came to our table after we sat down it all looked very unreal because a party of 6 men came in front of us and they were treated the way anyone should expect to be treated when they go to a restaurant handed out menus got drinks gotten their orders took and stuff yet again the girl that was suppose to be our server walks by and again when i waved at her she came a little closer to the table and asked ""oh so you are trying to order""?hold on i will be back in a few ,well guess what we waited for her because not that we now wanted to eat just so we can now actually let her know how pathetic this all is and we are leaving without even ordering a glass of water i am glad we walked right out after she came and we told her we are leaving because this is unacceptable which we did and i took my family right out of the restaurant and nobody even tried apologizing including the lady manager they have who was aware of us being treated like that i saw her rolling her eyes when our suppose to be server walked to her and told her something about us being upset because she thinks we are just sitting here trying to bother servers walking by or some made up story saying we didn't wanna order and all of that but how dumb can they be ? they didn't even give us the menus so how the heck would we order? well never ever again we are going to this buffalo wild wings location no matter how much we crave or no matter how far the other one is i will never step a foot even close to this location going inside of this restaurant is way out of question !  bye buffalo wild wings old orchard! you suck big time i hope you guys close down because the staff you have got some serious issues or are trained to be top notch racists thats all i can say otherwise this review would be a little lengthier if i brought up the racism issue which was a clear signal when we were there so lets just forget about it and lemme walk away by just hoping you would fix this at your restaurant one day in future."
"walked in and waited 10 minutes to be seated. no one acknowledged me or even paid attention. i even spoke out loud and said ""does anyone work here?"" don't know if it's the color of my skin or the way i look. i nodded heads with 2 different families eating there and i wasn't even greeted by 1 employee. what a joke. complete waste of time! let's take a guess to see if i'm coming back here......"
"rubber chicken.  this place is the definition of ""blah"".  the staff is fine and there are a lot of tv's, but it is just so mediocre and overpriced for what it is.  there are so many other places i would go before coming back here.  blah!"
"our server was great, however the host and food runner seemed less than thrilled when communicating with me and my party. despite the lack of enthusiasm, our host was still very polite and accommodating to us and our server was very friendly and definitely did her job and did it right. one of my friends ordered a batch of traditional wings and received a split order, one with seasonings the other without. when we brought this to our food runner's attention he took it back and returned it with the wings half seasoned. this is apparently not the first complaint the server received regarding the quality of the wings. overall the establishment looks fine, however the staff needs work."
"don't normally patronize chain restaurants/bar conglomerates but they were open quite late and was extremely close to prior engagement. the service was great, got my pbr in a charming brewery style glass and even had some delicious warm pretzels with queso. unsure if it's a corporate re-branding or just this location but the layout seemed brighter and more open than most of the buffalo wild wings i recall from a misspent youth."
"i remember going to a buffalo wild wings 8 years ago in cali. it was delicious then! now... eh not so much. they discontinued the mango lemonade, they discontinued the chicken curry flat bread. sometimes the wings are drenched in sauce sometimes the wings hardly have any sauce at all."
"if i could give it zero stars i would- i live 5 min from the mall so decided to visit this establishment out of pure convenience instead of the touhy location- big mistake- the hostess took forever to seat a family of 8  that was in front of us- gave them a corner table by the service door which would've clearly congested them in the area so i can see the mother asking to be moved- so that takes another 5 min-meanwhile- two teenage boys are screaming for a table for 6- finally she gets to us and in an agitated matter walks us over to a corner table right in front of the service door- again this restaurant is not crowded and filled with empty tables- why she keeps taking people to this corner i don't understand- i ask if my sister and i can be seated several tables down away from the door and as she walks away under her breath she says ""fine sit your ass over there"" yes- she muttered those words- i spoke with their assistant manager and general manager josh and luis who was polite and understanding and provided me with their regional manager's number- i called and left a voicemail so hope to hear back- i understand that it's in a mall and they hire teenagers but they need to be trained properly and learn how to act under pressure and or to customers even if they feel agitated- i'm in retail and go through many moments when i want to scream- but as a professional you ask for a break and get off the floor- i was appalled but yet not surprised to get this kind of service from here-"
i got take at this bdubs multiple times and have never had a problem. the staff is very friendly and the food always tastes great!
"normally i feel like sports bars are the armpit of places that sell food and drink. i usually rate them below the dingy of a dive bar. on the flip side, i have always respected that they have their place in the pursuit of ruining your diet. you can grab a burger on the fly, and wash it down with a beer. b-dubs will not have many frothy options for the beer snobs, but decent ones. if i'm dragged kicking and screaming, i come here for the boneless hot wings. buffalo wild wings serves everything, not just chicken. i respect them for their diversity of food, and it's all made on a mainstream level.   my first visit to buffalo wild wings was when my sister took me in indianapolis, and she kept calling it b-w3's. when i made it back to illinois, that was the last i'd heard of it until people started calling it b-dubs and i had no freaking idea what they were talking about. that was, until i did a little poking around on this restaurant's history. what was once buffalo wild wings & weck, was now just buffalo wild wings. got it.the most amazing, emasculating and driven force behind the idea that flourished into this wing joint, has its roots in figure skating. as a child james disbrow, co-founder of this establishment, had polio and went into iceskating in order to keep his legs strong. one of his good friends was scott hamilton. just as disbrow was being elected as president into the united states figure skating association, he passed away from brain cancer at the young age of 54. this makes me wonder if i recall seeing the figure skating competitions at this location. if not, in honor of mr. disbrow himself, i can say that is a sport i could honestly get into. i do believe i would finally find the beauty in the madness of flat screen tv's! b-dub's won't mess around with the intensity of their wing sauces. they have it all laid out on the menu. they depict a thermometer going downwards, wings from hell being the hottest, or what they are calling the ""reformulated blazin'."" i won't go there. i'll stick to the mango habañero, thank you. my only complaint would be that i can take the heat, but here you lose the flavor the hotter it gets. i think you should also be aware that it is almost impossible to taste anything following their wings of death. make sure you sample the cheese curds first, and, according to one of my friends, order in them as an appetizer sampler to cut down on cost. the breading over these ""come here and i'll help you forget your day"" morsels has a crispy shell which seems to boost the overall flavor. they come with a dipping sauce that is slightly spicy, creamy, and no doubt, fatty. yum!last, i need to remind first-time visitors that most of these reviews were written while this still relatively-new location was trying to get on its feet. that's not to say that you won't run into a few bad staff members. old orchard is known for the picky shoppers and i can also imagine they find their way through the doors of b-dubs. staff, keep your chin up, i'm part of that struggle too. to the rest of you devout followers, nah nah nah boo boo, i got one of your evanston managers as my retail manager! at first i could smell the hot wings all over him. now i have come to see what the rest of you are missing. sorry, i don't know if my company is letting you have him back any time soon. have faith, diners, and a better attitude. things are going to change for the better!"
"this is probably the worst bww. i went with my partner on a weekday around 6pm. we were asked if we want to sit at the high top tables in the bar area. we said no and asked if it was possible to get a booth. the man said every booth was full and we would have to wait 30+ minutes for a booth. he said he just sat every booth.....we settled for a table and sure enough, i look around and see people leaving from booths. it was pretttyyyy empty. our food was cold and the beer was expired. our waiter was okay. we went because we had a gift card and definitely wouldn't return."
"if you live in the city of chicago downtown, drive up to skokie to this location. it's worth it!clybourne location is terrible. the skokie location is clean, excellent customer service and no skimping on portions. we got a large serving of celery and carrots (compared to the measly 4 pieces at clybourne).great place! we will be back!"
"for drinks, this place is awesome. for some reason, a blue moon here tastes better than a lot of other places. as for the food, i think i ""grew out of it."" let me explain: when i was in high school, i thought this place was the bee's knees. i would come here on a biweekly, even sometimes on a weekly basis, with my friends because i always craved it and i loved that the whole place was full of teenagers. however, now i hate the atmosphere, and it's always so loud and full of obnoxious people. with that being said, i normally come here during the day now, instead of at night. i also don't think their wings are very good anymore... or their fries. their ""cheese fries"" are literally fries with shredded cheese all over them barely melted on. i literally had them take them off of my tab cuz i was disgusted with them. i've recently learned that i hate their boneless wings, but their traditional wings are delicious. i literally had a few pieces of boneless wing that looked like tofu had been sauced and cooked, meaning that my chicken was square and spongy on the inside. idk wtf happened, but it was so gross. after that experience, i only get the bone-in wings, which are very good, but i'm still very wary of this place due to the boneless wings. consequently, i don't really come here much anymore. my go-to is definitely the mango habanero wings. the sauce is amazing and very spicy, so do not get these if you don't want your lips to burn. pricing here is expensive for what you get, so i suggest coming on thursdays (if you like boneless wings) when boneless wings are $0.60 each... you order by multiples of 5. you can also come before 2pm every weekday and their lunch menu is pretty cheap!for the most part, all of the staff is very friendly and young. no one really knows about the different beers they sell, so don't count on them answering any beer questions for you. i also have noticed that the service is better by the bar area than the dining room area, but either way, service is normally pretty slow anywhere you sit.this place isn't always busy, but during any sort of big sporting event, this place gets packed. plan accordingly if you want to watch a game here or if you just want to eat here during a game."
"the female waitstaff are very nice, friendly and attentive. the host...not so much. he barely acknowledged me and then instantly became distracted by another off duty employee coming in after me asking for the schedule. all greeting him and ignoring taking care of seating me. the off duty employee did not care about causing the other staff member to neglect a customer. in fact, he outright encouraged it with his over zealous greetings and insistence of attention being given to him instantly. right now. wanted the upcoming schedule. then the host asked for my name to write it down. i don't know why. there was no line of people and no one else waiting when i came in. the store was not busy as it was 11:45 pm on a monday. then he disappeared without a word and took almost 5 minutes to come back. again. i don't know why. it shouldn't have taken that long to check which of the many tables available was open for me. i can only assume he'd had to stop yet again to chat up another male employee (that he was walking back with and chatting to before coming back to me) in the back section.  way to make a guest feel welcome and important. {extreme sarcasm here}on to the food. my waitress took good notes on exactly how i wanted my wings. there were stickers on each kind to the exact effect i requested. the cooks did not follow them exactly though. the boneless garlic parmesan wings were not extra saucy. they had just enough to almost completely cover them. i confess that's the real reason i said heavy on the sauce. i wanted them completely coated. not just partially as is their wont. the traditional mild came out super saucy but not well done as requested. in fact it said ""crispy"" on one of the wings' stickers for this set. as a friend of mine that likes her wings well done states...""well done is cooked through enough that the veins are melted away."" and in my opinion, the skin should be crispy as that sticker said. not loose and chewy. bleck. the chicken meat on them was cooked enough but with the not crispy skin and veininess, it kinda grossed me out a bit. buffalo chips used to be meaty potatoes. just like i like mine. the reason i became such a fan of the buffalo chips over wedges and fries in the first place. now you have to hunt for a few of them to be thick and potatoey. the rest are almost like regular potato chips. way too thin and fried through.anyhow, regardless of how nice the young ladies serving me where, the experiences i've had the last few times at various bwws, especially the front host of this one and the inconsistent wings, i don't know that i'll keep going back. i used to love this place. especially this location. as the staff were always very attentive and friendly. i suggest you get someone else at the host station as that is the face of your store and you don't want to be considered a rude and inattentive place as he was. bad first impression."
"i know buffalo wild wings is a chain and they are everywhere but this one is close to my heart.  they actually helped out with allowing my wife's charity to raise funds for pediatric brain cancer.  not only did they dedicate space for us but they allowed us to get food and drinks at a discount.outside of allowing us to host charitable events, the servers are usually extremely personable and attentive.  they pay the proper attention to all the dine in folks but not too much where they hover over you.the specials are abundant albeit they are mostly alcoholic beverages.  they have a ton of beers in draft and a slew of others in bottles.in terms of food, they have $0.60 boneless thursdays.love love love this place and always itching to come back with the wife"
the worst service we ordered cheese curds boneless wings the came out cold we told the waitress to send the cheese curds first and they send it to us when we got the check it was a very bad experience we didn't recive silverware. i would give 0 review if i could...
standard bww experience. was glad to see they were playing premier league on the big tvs. service slightly above average. mango habanero wings are still my favorite. onion rings at this location was better than usual.
"this is a standard buffalo wild wings near the best buy in skokie.  there is plenty of parking and the restaurant is rarely crowded.  you can all types of chicken wings and a good variety of sandwiches / wraps.  there are about 13 sauces to choose from with some being very hot!  i like the spicy thai sauce - it had a nice heat but also a tasty curry twist to it. a snack order of boneless wings was 8 pieces, so more than enough for my dinner.  be sure to try the awesome mozzarella sticks as a starter.  they are little sticks of molten cheesy goodness!  the only drawback is they only have pepsi products.the main reason i like this location is tuesday kids night.  they have $1.99 kids meals complete with ice cream.  this is a tremendous deal as dinner for a family of 4 is under $30!  the have a talented balloon artist walking around and entertaining the children.  the staff is very attentive and gets the meals out quickly so young children don't have time to get cranky."
"it used to be good but not anymore. if you like your food reheated in the microwave you'll love this place. the fries with cheese was nasty, your not supposed to microwave food that was previously deep fried. our waiter told us we need to tell them you want fresh food when ordering, and said the cook is lazy. is there a manager at this place? probably. obviously nobody at this place cares. out of business soon. super disgusting."
"my husband and son's favorite place to dine at on tuesday's! buffalo wild wings can be pretty pricy which is why we take advantage on tuesdays since they have 50cent wings. my son and husband usually get the mild traditional wings and i go for the much hotter ones, mango habanero. the mango habanero will have your mouth on fire! they are sweet, tangy and spicy! we also ordered margaritas. they were on the weak side however and they have more nice than liquid. i'd say skip it and go for a beer. the service was great. the waitress seemed to be training someone because she had someone shadowing her the entire time. they were both very helpful and took care of our table well."
"i am not that impressed with bww but then again why should i be? i have never heard of any one say how amazing the food is, how great the beers are or wow the decor is so creative. the wings are not bad but that's as far as the good words go. why are there 20 plus beers on tap but none of them call me. there is no reason the line up should have miller lite, coors lite, bud and bud light at the same time. one of them should do. they need to fire their distributor, just saying. and one more advice. the staff should really pick up a broom every so often. it is very dirty here."
this location wasn't quite as good as others i've been to. the wings were not sauced very well and seemed to be dry/old. my beer was a short pour and they had a few issues with the kegs in back so it took a long time to get a refill. i usually have a great time at bww's but this visit left more to be desired.
"they service is typically good, the food is typically good, but i feel like bww is just getting more and more over priced. the wings are some time small, and they are not giver equal number of drumsticks and ""wings"""
"multiple disappointing experience from carry out food. most of the time they will forget sauces ( for which we always pay extra) and today i ordered chocolate fudge cake. please have a look on the cake which came in ice cream cup , all smashed , no ice cream with that. i wonder how they expect people to come back again after these multiple blunders. once can be a mistake but repeated bad service is sign of poor management and lack of efficient staff."
"awesome restaurant! stay with me here. why would i say that? it's for people for the younger generation if you want to be waited on. you get what you pay for, especially if our not going to be tipping you waiters. the staff isn't that knowledgeable on beers, but who can blame them? it's on the menu. it is my favorite bww to go, and i live in chicago. i come for the service and the management care. all other bww have bad service."
"this place is just pure madness. first of all, it's always a wait list. luckily we only waited about ten minutes before we were seated. our table was not ready for us even though we were escorted to the table and there was food on the seat. i asked one of the waitresses to clean it- i mean don't they look before telling people to sit down? i cannot tell you how much food there was under the table from them ""wiping"" the table down. the waitress was nice but you could tell she was swamped with work and was just flying from table to table. anyways, we ordered the appetizers which gives you a choice of four mini appetizers. the chili cheese fries did not taste fresh- the actual meat was cold and the fries were soggy. the artichoke dip was gross too- the dip was dried out- i have a picture where you could tell where we dipped our chips in and how ""fresh"" it should look vs how it looked. i ordered 6 bbq, 6 parmesan and 6 mild traditional wings. the wings were the best part- everything else was basic. it's not quality service. the servers are not attentive- got my second refill as we asked for the check- pretty frustrating."
long long wait for carryout. was told 10 minutes.  not hardly.  workers crowded around kitchen talking and laughing.  no evidence of any manager. mixed up system it seemed.  the wings when i finally got them were chewy and tasteless. not a great place.
"food was fantastic, i really enjoyed the poker game with my new roommate, (sean)our sever did a great job and really enjoyed his help today , loved the desert heat wings :) will be going back !! he asked me if i'm a cubs or socks fan ... lol i'm a houston astros fan i just moved here but still rep we're i'm from"
"i love buffalo wild wings so when a location gets it right, i have to give them props. lately i've had pretty good experiences at this location. there was this one time when the server would barely show up and the food came out dry and almost ""re-heated"" tasting but most of my other times here were pretty spot on.i'm writing a review today cause my experience was awesome! i went in today for the march 13th bogo deal. i ordered it for takeout and the people who helped us out were so great. they answered all our questions, made sure we got everything and were polite and patient about it all. the two taking our order were jeremy and haley. they were super friendly and helpful. haley brought out our food and double checked that everything was as it was supposed to be, one by one. she made sure we got all the sauces we ordered and napkins, silverware etc. the order came out under the 15 mins she estimated which went by super quick! the food was great, wings sauced and cooked to perfection. i tried the shrimp tacos which were good ( a little small), but i'd probably get overall, today's customer service was spot on... i went around 1:00pm on a monday which seems to be a good time haha. i think the one day i had the bad experience was toward the end of the night, so if you are ordering around that time maybe ask for more sauce on your wings in advance."
this spot is a perfect date night spot before or after the movies. customer service is ok. the food came out in good time. will recommend the asian zing.
"buffalo wild wings has been a hit or miss for me when it comes to their hand spun wings whether they are boneless or traditional. i have had occasions when i found the wings absolutely delicious (weird, i know) because they were cooked perfectly. other days, well they are usually overcooked and dry. again, standard tasting when it comes to their wings.nothing mind blowing if you ask me. i was just having a huge craving for some greasy fatty foods that i will regret later.i usually order ahead of time online because it's much more convenient. it usually take 20 minutes tops for my order to be ready. not this case though!yesterday (boneless thursday), was definitely not the greatest attempt on carrying out. my order was ready at 9:20 p.m. i arrived around 9:25 p.m. there was only one gentleman holding down the pickup/carry out. i had about five people ahead of me at this point.just waiting and waiting some more. it was finally my turn. i did not get my food and leave until 9:45 p.m. all that time spent waiting was as much time for any food to be cooked.unfortunately, my wings were warm. ):  i have to say, i may have to find a new wings place that isn't a chain next time to satisfy my cravings."
we were seated in an area where there was no waitress then this lovely girl came and pick up our table so it was great she was fabulous she made sure to keep up everything and made our visit great when it coukd if been horriable
"i'm not sure what's going on with this location..but my experience today was awful. it took over an hour to get our food because they lost our ticket twice. they said they would get us our sodas 3 different times (all by 3 different people) but took a long time to do that. and, if i'm really nitpicky, they gave me regular pepsi instead of diet.overall just an unfriendly, unhelpful atmosphere and if the game we were watching wasn't doing as amazing as they were, we would have left :/"
"mediocre service.  we were one of two parties waiting to be seated (many tables available). a gentleman came to the host stand and seated the party in line ahead of us. after seating them, he looked over at us and proceeded to walk away toward the bar and disappear. we probably should have left, but looking forward to some wings. table service not much better. sat with empty drink glasses for 15 minutes.  wings came without the usual celery and dip."
"ate here recently on a tuesday (09/12/17) for lunch. pros: good food and the server was a hoot! con: food delivery seemed on the slow side (15+ minutes). i would come for lunch or dinner here again, or get carry out because i think the food is pretty good."
"i figured while we were sitting here still waiting on our food that i would write a review. yes, it took an hour to get our app and now we are counting on almost 45 min for our dinner. forget getting refills on drinks. seriously the worst service!!! we would have left, but good luck finding our server."
"i love buffalo wild wings half price wings tuesday, but i hate the experience i just had at this buffalo wild wings. i ordered a large traditional wings with hot sauce, with the special request for them to have extra sauce. i drove to the store and arrived at the time i was told my wings would be ready. after waiting an additional 15 minutes i received my order. i checked the box of wings, and it was marked with a large, hot, and wet sticker. looked great. after driving all the way home i found something else. the large, supposed to be around 18 wings, only held 12.... which is less than is supposed to be in a medium. the wet sticker was also a lie. they were basically dry and sauceless. also just to add insult to injury, my side of celery contained two pieces of celery. 2!! overall i couldn't be more upset. ruined my night"
"having a buffalo wild wings near campus is great, because buffalo wild wings is one of those restaurants that almost anyone can enjoy. between wings and burgers, everyone is bound to find something they enjoy. this location definitely has good deals, and if you go on the right nights, can find substantial discounts on wings. last time i went, wings were half off, which was great. (this deal typically does not include boneless wings.) the food is standard quality for bww, but it is still very good and items come out at good quality. i also appreciate the fact they have the interactive tablets; it's fun to play trivia at your table while waiting on your food. you can compete against others in the restaurant, and sometimes the questions/scores show up on the tvs, which is pretty cool!that being said, the one major issue with this location is the service; specifically, the food takes forever. now, i am not the type of person to fault a business the first time they are slow with service. i get it - things get backed up, orders get messed up, it happens. however, with that in mind, the service here is consistently slow. the last time i went, we waited about 45 minutes after placing our order for our food. the time before that, it was a similar wait. we only ordered two orders of wings and a side of onion rings. it is beyond me why the wait is like this. once the food arrives, it's good, but man, it can be brutal waiting for it.overall, i wouldn't say you should avoid this location; i would just be prepared for the possibility of a wait. don't plan on going anywhere afterwards at a specific time. if you don't have a busy schedule afterwards, the food here is pretty good."
"came here with my cousins after the iu v. purdue football game. some of my cousins, including me, are iu fans and we were heckled by customers sitting at the table next to us. we were asked what we were doing there and some ""wished us luck"" for coming to a ""purdue establishment"". little did i know, they were right. we waited for over 2 hours for our food. our waiter finally told us that our food orders were lost and that since they were busy it would be another 45 minutes to an hour before our food came out. my sister then suggested they put our food order in first (duh) since we had already been waiting two hours. our waiter said he ""thinks he can do that"" and that he'll ""see what he can do"".worst service i've ever received."
"this place was below my expectations! they were a little weird when we walked in, than it went down hill fast. the service here is very slow. we received our wings cold. the cheese curds we ordered when we sat down didn't arrive until after the wings came. they claimed there was a problem in the kitchen. celery was barely anything and gross. i would never come here again!!!"
"i stop by this buffalo wild wings location once in a while, and always really enjoy the food. we went on a thursday for half price margaritas and 65 cent boneless wings. i'm not sure i'll ever come here on a night that isn't thursday again, so good. the dining area is big, and normally very busy. the service is slow, so never plan on eating here if you're in a rush. this is more of a place where you can sit for a few hours, have a few laughs with friends, and wait on your food. i've never had bad food here, nor bad drinks. like most sports bars there are televisions surrounding you on all sides, and this location also offers tablets to play games on. definitely a great place to hang with your friends."
"the bartender was great . however i ordered one item and the kitchen got it wrong. i ordered mild wings and instead was given medium. i politely told them they should have been mild. even the bartender overheard and said yes they ordered mild. no big deal right? except they walked back to the kitchen , changed the sticker on the side of the cardboard plate and gave me the exact same wings ."
no server at all. waited for 30 minutes at the table and even i asked someone for service. no one cared. worst restaurant worst service. stupid as ****
"today was the first time we ever left a restaurant without paying. we waited for our food for over 2 hours, so the only thing we actually didn't pay for was 2 beers and a children's pop. the management there has a lot of serious issues to figure out."
"consistent quality and service, but let me share this lovely bit:while going to pick up my free birthday wings and the fries and drink i ordered (to pay for), the manager compted the whole ticket. i then forgot my drink, not really caring since they were taking care of the rest of the bill now, but the to go server ran after me outside to bring it to me. great foodgreat servicegreat email club (free snack sized wings on your birthday)"
"great location and friendly staff! i carry out, and they never disappointed. order was prepared on time and purdue gets 20% discount. overall great experience so far!!"
"this buffalo wild wings is good enough.  the food is a little pricey, but you know that going into it. the price usually includes the experience, which is the main point of heading to bww.my girlfriend and i called ahead, and the hostess suggested that we drive an hour early to get seats to watch the nba finals. when we arrived, the place was completely empty, so if you're coming for a big game, you don't need to show up until about 30 mins before game time in order to get good seats.unfortunately, our waitress wasn't too thrilled with us waiting to watch the game, even though she had other tables that were doing the same thing. we were sure to order appetizers and allow her to take her time with other tables, since we are pretty low maintenance. there are other patrons who seemed to have similar experiences with  unpleasant attitudes from the staff.the wings are better than most places, but still nothing mind blowing. i probably won't be coming back."
"the traditional wings served at this particular buffalo wild wings are very good.  generally, my friends and i attend the buffalo wild wings on the levee for convenience-it is close to home & everything else in town. keep up the good work team because the customers notice what an excellent job the cooks do because of the, ""kick butt,"" wings."
"okay, i work right next door, so i eat here several times a week. the food is great, but the wait times are ridiculous. my best advice would be to order online using the app. my favorite is the shrimp po-boy with cheese curds instead of fries! delish."
the place brazy. paid $1.42 per wing for crummy service and half coated wings. smh. i'm calling my lawyer.
slow disorganized cold food. don't bother with takeout. the food is never ready and you have to wait at least 30 minutes for it once you pay. food is cold. staff could give a shit. if you get the dry rub make sure you have them re-spin your order. they get real stingy with it.
"unsure why this location struggles with service speed. they have been slow my last 3 visits. even though it was wing night (buy one get one free), they were not overly busy even in the bar which was where we sat. beer came fairly quickly, but that was the exception. ordered mozzarella sticks and had to ask about them 20 minutes later. they came out steaming hot which means they were probably forgotten. manager stopped by about a half hour later to ask how we were doing. we had to say our wings had not arrived. he brought them out a few minutes later with no explanation why it took so long and no offer of compensation for our inconvenience. while the food will probably take me back, i sure hope they can get their act together and speed up the service."
"very poor bar service. asked for a shake, bartender got caught up talking to the friend at the end of the bar, came back 10 minutes later and said she's out of the captain crunch. so, shame on the manager for running out of what you need for a promotional item! twenty minutes later i asked for my food because it still had not been brought out. my meal got here and all the sauces were dried up on the wings like they had been sitting under a heat lamp forever. my ranch had a mystery french fry in it... after i ate my food then my cheese sticks were delivered... the fridge behind the bar isn't stocked and looks so sloppy it's disgusting. if i were the owner or manager, i would be livid, disappointed, and ashamed of how my facility looks and is being ran. there's a waitress at the end of the bar showing a customer pictures of her family and her on her cell phone... what a disappointment. i will not return"
"i don't know what it is with buffalo wild wings in this area, but i have yet to find one that doesn't appear to be understaffed. i went with my friends to this location about a week ago, and it there was a huge group of people waiting in the entryway. i was a bit surprised because the parking lot wasn't that full. upon looking in the restaurant though, there were plenty of free tables. there simply wasn't any host or hostess at the front taking people to tables. other groups were confused about this as well. kind of odd. so we waited a few minutes, and eventually someone comes and starts seating tables. after about 15 minutes total of waiting, we were seated.our waitress was very nice, but it was clear the kitchen was backed up. we waited a long while for our food, more so than one would ever expect for wings. i ordered the small order of boneless wings and potato wedges. my friends also ordered wings. i always order the parmesan garlic sauce and the salt and vinegar rub. finally, our food arrived. there isn't much to say about the food - it's exactly what you expect for a buffalo wild wings. nothing too amazing, nothing bad. i find the small size is perfectly sufficient for me; it comes with about 12 wings. i've never come here hungry enough to eat more than that. overall, i would come here only if you don't mind waiting. if you're going to be staying to watch a game or something like that, then it may not be an issue. if you're in a rush though, it may not be the best idea."
"terrible service! so it's friday night and the place is maybe 70% full so we expected a little slowness but nothing like this. it was 45 minutes in before we got our appetizer. it takes like 5 minutes to fry so what was happening the other 40.  it was delivered with no plates or napkins. just awesome. another 20 minutes later we're told our food is almost ready. i wouldn't exactly call it piping hot when it came out. some of the wings were cold.  sauces were wrong or forgotten. the wrong drink was delivered. we had to ask for silverware to eat things supposed to be eaten with utensils. i guess everything they serve is supposed to be eaten with your fingers. after an hour an a half, we finally got out of there.  maybe she was new, high, had boyfriend problems or the kitchen was slow, but it was completely ridiculous to wait as long as we did."
"we had a party of 11.  the server was accommodating, but little else.  our food took almost a half an hour but as usual our food was cold.  i mean my fries were cold, my burger was cold and so was my boyfriend's burger.  this was my third attempt at this location usually due to friends desire to go there...never ever again.  the server took all of our cards at once and as she was handing them back said she didn't know whose cards went with what check .  we should have just went to steak and shake about the same quality and at least their food is hot."
"went there around 1pm for lunch on a tuesday. a little busily, but seemed well staffed. i saw every server on the area (at least) walk by and never acknowledged me. not even a ""i'll be right with you. "" so after 10 min i had to leave so i could get food elsewhere and get back to work."
"i came here last night, waited almost an hour to be seated. almost 20 mins to even be acknowledged by the staff. okay i understand they are busy. i work in food so i completely understand that. we finally get seated and get to order, we had to wait another hour for our food. we get our food and have no silverware. have to wait another 15 mins just for that. i got chicken tenders so i didn't need a fork so i started eating. all of our food was ice cold. never again. i got there at 8:40 pm and by the time everything was said and done it was 11:20. mind you shortly after we were seated most of the tables were cleared out, and most of the waitresses were just huddled around in the back talking. terrible wait times, terrible food, and terrible service. no thank you. never again."
"horrible food, horrible service. had to wait for an hour before being served. food came cold and nasty. never again."
probably shouldn't have bartenders on a sunday night who don't want to listen to/watch football
"it took literally 45 minutes to get two small orders of wings with buffalo chips. when we finally received our food, it was barely warm. maybe it was sitting in the server window a while, i dunno, but we didn't say anything bc by the time the server came back to check on us it was another 10+ minutes. it was not crowded at all. this has happened here before, there won't be a next time."
"what a horrible place to watch sunday night football. with 5 minutes left until halftime, the bar staff turns the game's audio off and starts playing music. pretty frustrated, i go to the bar and ask if they could at least wait to play music until halftime. the bartender rolled his eyes at me and said ""sure"" as if i was making the most annoying request in the world. on top of that, the service was horrendous. our waitress went mia for at least 20 minutes. bad all around."
"disgusting and not worth a return trip - ever!  salad had spoiled lettuce sprinkled throughout. the croutons were stale. the garlic bread had probably been made yesterday and was cold, dry and tasteless. the $.65 wings were mostly breading, dry and under sauced. wings is part of their name - you would think they would at least get that right. nope!  if the restaurant isn't making any effort, then why should you? bw3 under delivers, over charges and doesn't give a whit.  i'm done.  keep driving and choose one of the alternatives close by - you'll be far happier."
"i came here a year ago to watch the us women's soccer game at the bar and there were two belligerent men there very loudly describing women in their lives as c***s. the bartenders did nothing to stop this or asking them to quiet down. in fact, the bartenders continued to serve them drinks as they continued to get louder. eventually i walked up and ask if they could keep their voices down because some people didnt appreciate those offensive words and then one of the men got up and followed me, came to my table, and began to raise his voice. i removed myself and went to the bathroom and he stood outside of the women's bathroom for roughly 15 minutes screaming c**** waiting for me to come out. it was a horrifying experience and my friend said many of the workers seemed to be laughing while i was scared and trapped in a bathroom.also, their wings aren't great and the manager who discussed this matter with me couldn't even spell my name right on our emails back and forth even though my name signed at the bottom. i will never go to another buffalo wild wings because it's not about having a good experience to them, and if they have to do any work outside of the minimum they won't. this location needs new management, and some training on when to cut people off at the bar. don't waste your time here."
i called in a carry out order and they didn't seem very nice on the phone and even cut me off while i was talking but when i got there they were pretty nice actually. they told me 20 mins but i got there 10 mins early and it was ready and it was about 5 pm busy dinner time - but a thursday. it was nice my food was ready to go earlier than expected. it seems like a clean place but it can be annoying to get to. it's on a corner lot and appears to be ina good spot but you have to drive around either side of it and go around because it's actually off a road of its own. not great.
i am in town just a few days and i have been out of this area for ten years but the bartender eric says hey matt and i said what? it took me by surprise and he said i used to play ball with you like 20 plus years ago! that's what you call a memory and a bartender that pays attention to who he is serving! the bar filled up and he served everyone like a champ! eric is a champion bartender that knows how to get the job done under pressure!
"ordered carry out via their ios app.  went in and picked up food.  got home and one of the boxes had no sauce at all on the wings.  called them and went back in (15 min each way, cold, rainy).  person at the counter implied it was my fault because i said she didn't have to check the order.  terrible service.  rude staff.   manager never bothered to talk to me.  wouldn't mind so much, but the wings are overpriced and they really didn't care at all that a customer was inconvenienced.  luckily wings etc is opening near me.  there are good bdubs but i suggest avoiding this one."
i love bdubs!!!! i miss their buffalo chicken flatbread but i'll just stick to wings now. asian zing is the best!! the service was great and there were about five other tables. my waitress was very nice and never left me without a drink. our food came out delicious and fresh. keep up the great work. this is my favorite location!!
"oh this place. as i am currently sitting at the table i once again ask myself why i even bother coming here. the service is mediocre at best and the food is the same. it doesn't matter if the restaurant is full or if there is only a handful of people present, plan to wait 45 minutes at least to receive your food. when you finally receive your food, assuming it's correct, most likely it will be cold. in which you have to send it back again. it'd almost be more productive to send the food back as soon as it comes out. don't even bother with this place drive up the road to texas roadhouse or even the dq next door to receive better food and better service."
they got rid of jammin jalapeno!!! i'm so sad! 65 cent wings on tuesday and thursday will never be the same again.
ho  ho ho ho how horrible is thee to be seated in a booth for 20 minutes and to see other patrons come in and get seated and served immediately.  well that's not gapping so i took my party on down the road .pretty sad to see all the staff standing around talking  amongst there selves
"not gonna write a long review as it doesn't really matter. -  food was okay, bit over sauced and not the warmest.-  service was eh.short and sweet for a general chain. nothing outstanding here."
"comically mismanaged location! we had to wait over one hour for just two snack orders of plain wings (10 wings total). tried ordering a small order of french fries on the side. they were out of french fries at 6:30 on a friday night. my girlfriend ordered a side caesar salad with the salad dressing on the side. ok, lets see how they can mess that order up. well, for starters they soak the salad in dressing when the order finally arrives (i'd say it took about one hour and twenty minutes). the salad dressing isn't even caesar dressing (some sort of honey dressing). at this point i am expecting a television crew to come out with lights, and say you'd been ""punk'd!""i complained to a waitress about the time it was taking for our meal and she appeared shortly after to apologize and stated she would take care of our meal for us (read: comp'ed). the waitress that had been serving us was lovely and by no fault of her own, we were completely dissatisfied with the service.  the wings were really good tho!! we will not be back to this location until it is under new management!!nope!"
0 outta 10 wouldn't recommend. service was slow as granny at like 11pm. beer is beer. mojito was aight. music was good.
this bww tends to have very spotty inconsistent service.  the food is consistent with the chain and they carry some local peoria beers which is nice.
"if i could give this place zero stars i would. i have been to plenty of bww. the service is normally shitty at all of them but this one is by far the worst. we walked in and stopped at the hostess stand where it even says please wait to be seated; the girl stared at us for a few minutes and then finally said ""do you need seated?, sit wherever"" it then took 10 min before someone come to take a drink order. she brought them back took our food order we didn't see her again until our food came and that was only once. the place was empty - maybe 3 other tables - and it took over 30 minutes to get a small boneless and a medium traditional with fries. the staff was more worried about cleaning the whole place at 8pm (when they close at midnight) than tending to customers. i will never come to this one again."
"it's your typicaly bwws. they do have a great selection of tvs everywhere so no matter where you sit, you're going to see a game. which game? who knows. while the cardinals and cubs were playing, the cleveland game was on half of the tvs so we had to squeeze into one side of the booth to catch the game we wanted to watch. food is pretty good. again, typically for this chain. they must have a great bartender because our drinks were a highlight. wasn't too busy on a sunday afternoon (not during nfl season) so we will be back."
"i'm not quite the frequenter, it's just not my atmosphere. call me pretentious, but i'll give credit where it is due. my significant other wanted to catch the viking's game, and if you didn't know, there are no shortage of tvs, so we opted to come here. the host, for whatever reason it seemed, had a difficult time seating us, though it was clear how many vacant tables there were; we were left standing in the middle of the floor for about 5 minutes with menus in hand. it was just odd. with no sign of the host coming back, we flagged down a server and asked if we could seat ourselves. she replied ""yes"", and walked off. if i had been in a worse mood i suppose we would have left, but we didn't complain.  i'll skip over the part and in betweens that we had 3 different servers trying to get our drinks and orders. when ""brian"" (he looked like a brian) was the decided server for the duration, he apologized to us as if he knew what had been happening the whole time. haha. anyways, brian did a fantastic job for the entirety. he made our 1 star visit a 2 star. he was fast and efficient with my continuous drink orders. my girl ordered the buffalo chicken rap and says it was delicious; the side of wedges with it, i tried, and were tasty and crispy. the highlight of the evening though was the ultimate nachos. i don't order nachos often, but, i dare say they are now one of my new favorite places to get em. they are fairly inexpensive, especially for the whopping amount they pile on; loaded with chicken, cheese, beef, beans, and jalapeños (if you choose). good job ""brian"", and great nachos at bww's."
"this review is solely based on my takeout at b-dubs tonight. i will return to dine in and add on/update this review!every tuesday b-dubs has a special on traditional wings, currently priced at 60 cents per wing. (used to be 50 cents, and 40 cents prior to that back in 2007 or so) anyway, that's why b-dubs are usually packed on tuesdays. this is my first time going to this location. i ordered 10 traditional wild wings with a side of fries. b-dub's french fries are among my top 3 favorite btw, next to popeye's cajun fries and pollo tropical waffle fries. as like any other fries that you'd get, it must be hot and crispy.service was fine, friendly and outgoing staff here at the takeout counter. oh, and they got my order correct so even though that should be a given, it's not so common anymore. when i opened my box of wings, it was loaded with sauce and the chicken was still crispy... yummmmmm! the fries were still hot, crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, exactly how every fry should be. i've been to locations all over orlando and other cities where at some, they barely put any sauce on their wings.trust me, you want to stay away from those places! this location did not disappoint. overall, i'm very satisfied with the quality here and will return to dine in and see how that goes. i only ever get 2 sauces when i come here. 1) wild and 2) asian zing. wild has a nice kick to it(rated as their 2nd hottest sauce), whereas asian zing is sweet with a little heat and a hint of ginger. both equally delicious!"
"this place has really gone downhill.  almost inedible food....only ok service....and drinking there can get very expensive compared to other ""sports bars"" in the area. with the way wings and fried chicken restaurants have really blown up the last few years, there are about 20 other options in the area i'd rather go to.  don't think i'll be back."
"the manager at the grand prarie buffalo wild wings is so kind and always out and about among the diners and sets a great example for his staff!the waiters/resses are very friendly and the service is fast, which helps when on a tight schedule!"
"reasonably clean. lots of sports, lots of beers on tap, several menu options beyond just wings. the wait staff are usually young but usually pretty good."
great service! brian was a really personable and attentive waiter!! food was ok! grilled chicken salad and chicken fingers! fries at bw3s need to be fresh-cut ! good spot for a game and a beer!
i don't like bww. music is too loud and food is not very good and somewhat expensive.
"i've tried to like it, at least five times, my kids always want to eat here. the service is generally okay, the place isn't too dirty for a sports bar, but the boneless wings i've gotten have generally been big salty globs of batter. on the other hand, the traditional wings have been under cooked to the point of being frightening. add to that the price, outrageous in my book. just, no. never again."
food is always excellent. service is pretty good too. restaurant is always super busy so cleanliness is sometimes lacking.
"as usual, bw3's is amazing.   this location is great - it's not often that you see one with such great service and well-made food.  everything was perfect.they also have a yelp checkin offer for 20% off, amazing!"
"one of the poorest food service experiences i've had.  had a take out order for an office (5 people, so still a smaller sized order).  showed up when i was to pick up the food, paid for the food and took a seat.  20 minutes later after being asked twice by staff members what i order i was waiting for (neither of which came back after asking) i got back in line to get up to the counter again.  when i got there, i finally got my food (30 minutes after the scheduled pick up time)  they tried to charge me again and when i said i had already paid, they angrily informed me it was my fault i had to wait so long because i didn't barge through people and tell them i had already paid.  (even though i had done so in person just 30 minutes prior and was told to wait, as i was patiently doing.)  and i'm not sure why they were mad at me for their waste of my time?!  called the manager and informed him of my experience and was told ""i'll be sure to talk to that employee"" even though he had no idea which employee it was, since i had no idea and couldn't tell him if i wanted to.  what a joke of a business.  they are officially off of my list of places to order from.  i hope bww corporate takes notice of this location and makes some corrective action to save their reputation."
"my boyfriend and i had a great experience the other night. i'm sure it's a lot crazier during the weekends or when it's a holiday, but we went later at night, the atmosphere was great, it was a slow time. our server was very attentive and courteous. the food was great. i normally get the boneless wings when i go to the east peoria chain, and the wings definitely aren't as good there. they're always hard with too much breading. this specific chain, they were great, and not hard at all. i had the sweet bbq and half honey bourbon, which were both great. we had the queso and chips as an appetizer, i also had a salad and my beau had the buffalitos. he seemed satisfied as well. they brought the gaming device to the table like we asked, and we had a fun laid back time. definitely recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere to go for a late date night or just to relax. probably wouldn't be as chill on a weekend though, of course the one in east peoria is always very busy in my experience, but either way. it's all about the timing."
"i have noticed a steady decline in food over the last few months, but tonight was so bad. i came in with my family after a hockey game for some dinner and watch some bowl games. our server was good and orders where taken quickly. one boneless snack wing and one large traditional wing. the server came back to our table twice to double check our order.  when the order came it was correct, except some of the wings where soggy and cold.  when our server came to check i told her about the wings being not of the best quality. i was informed that her manager said since we were served the wings they can not fix them. i sent them back. when we got our bill they where still on there. my wife questioned it and again was told that she tried but the manager said to charge us. the server then came with a new bill with a small discount. the manager then for the first time came to our table and said he did not know we did not like our food and that the server miss informed him. i asked if he knew that we sent our food back because we did not like it and he said yes. how could a manager try to throw his server under the bus instead of visiting our table to make sure we where okay. it's good to know that old chicago is still doing a great job."
"the food was amazing and i loved nicole she was an awesome waitress and was full of spontaneous energy and was just a blast!! the huckleberry lemonade was sweet but not too sweet, and the boneless wings were tasty, full of flavour, and very delicious! the mayan mole sauce was a huge hit for me! will be coming back here as soon as i can!! :)"
this location always provides excellent service.  paul in particular behind the bar does a great job and provides the best service every time.
"party of 3 just sat waiting 45 minutes and 3 updates of ""your food will be right out"" and still no food.   watched a table behind us order more food same time finish their meal and leave and 2 tables come in after us - order more food and were eating it within 10 to 15 minutes.   finally told the manager cancel our order and left to go find food."
"ok...so...i'm not saying this is a 4 star restaurant...but...gotta say it's a 4 star bw's the bar has been raised bw's. and here's why...i have been coming to bw's since college, when they used to have foosball tables and .50 legs!!! oh the good old days. typically the service has digressed, it's shoty what type of service you get or quality of wings you get, tonight this store rocked it though. it was super busy with a bunch of softball and kids baseball teams, but i got a seat quick and my waitress gave me a 5 star service. she was hustling checked up on me often and was super nice. and best of all the wings were hot and fresh not all shriveled up like some bw's i've been too. well done and this 4 stars is for you! would definitely come back:)"
"don't know why every bw's is better then the one back home,and this one beats it hands down. clean neat with great staff would definitely go back. mine back home i wouldn't miss if it left town."
this is the only place i've ever been to that runs out of beer and blames the distributor and not the fact that they didn't order it. to top that they gave is cheaper drafts rather than upgrade it to a better beer. this will be my last visit here. on a positive note the waitress was one of the best i've had.
"my favorite time to go to bww is on thursday's when they have 1/2 off boneless wings. you really get what you pay for: decent food, fast service, and a great place to watch the game. i have always had really friendly service and have never left disappointed. today, i had an amazing experience. i had ordered my food and mentioned to the waiter how hungry my friend and i were. after maybe 7 minutes, our food arrived! i was so pleasantly surprised. our waiter came back and told him how impressed i was and he said that he had hurried things up for us because he knew we were hungry. definitely a happy customer!"
haven't always had the greatest service here but they made my day. i called in for lunch one day and came in at the promised time. my order wasn't ready and after sitting for 20 min i had to go back to work. i didn't get lunch that day as bww was supposed to be my lunch. promised a 10 piece and happened to come in for pickup one night and told manager what happened. he said they stopped doing this and i was ready to pay as it wasn't a huge deal and he went ahead and made the order as promised. thanks i had a rough day and it made my day! it makes me have faith that there are some good people in the world.
"food is good, but slow.  try to order online for lunch due to the wait, still slow.  now ordered dinner 40 minutes ago online for a pickup in 30, haven't got food yet.  why have ordering with a set time if you can't meet my order.  now i'll be back late to work."
one of the better buffalo wild wings i have been to. friendly staff and superb service during closing hours even. thank you guys so much.
"went to bww last night with a group to watch the world series game.  i ordered the habernero mango wings.  they were very large, very tasty and very hot!!  hotter than i needed but the menu showed it as very hot so no complaints here.  my wife had the blue burger.  she said it tasted very good and one of the ladies in our group commented that it looks just like the picture in the menu.  we also had the ultimate nacho's, they were very good, not sure ultimate, but good.  they have a great beer selection also and i did try a couple that i was not familiar with.  our server, sarah, was the best server i have had in a long, long time.  she seemed to sense that my wife and i were not bww regulars and took time explaining menu options to us. she also saw that i was enjoying but surprised by the heat of my wings and made sure i did not run out of beer.  she also suggested a small ice cream to help with my burning lips. lol.  great evening out, great food, great service."
"the food at bdubs is mediocre, but at least they are open and serve food until their posted hours on yelp. that is a major achievement compared to other businesses."
"it's a b-dubs, so you know what to expect. the atmosphere is hard to beat when you are watching sports. they have every sports package known to man.  they have a good selection of beers on tap, weekly specials, and everything else in bottles.  the food is simple and it gets to you quickly.  the wings are excellent and hard to pass up.wednesday night is family night and they even have a balloon guy come in to make things for the kids.great for groups or just one or two.  it's usually busy, so you may have to wait to get a table.  however,  you can usually jump into the bar area!"
"went out to bww for a quick dinner.  food was good our waitress bailey, not sure if the spelling was attentive without hovering.  my issue of the evening.  i went to the ladies room, i go in a stall and i notice the person in the stall next to mine has put a black purse on the floor.  i'm thinking ew gross, but then i realize, it's not a purse but a black waitress apron.  then i'm totally grossed out, is this my waitress, setting her apron in the bathroom floor then touching it constantly the rest of the night before getting drinks, bringing out food etc? so i finish quickly, kind of curious if this disgusting person is my waitress.  i hurry leave the stall, but alas she's gone.  the pig with the germ floor dwelling apron also has left the bathroom without washing her hands. the trifecta of disgusting.  i get back to the table to tell  my family how ready to hurl i am only to find out our waitress had brought the check and cashed out the ticket while i was in the ladies room.  i couldn't have been her.  so my recommendation is sit in baileys section since she is the only one i can rule out."
"this was the first buffalo wild wings the i visited.  i was not far from where i worked in peoria.  a coworker and i would go here occasionally and it became our go-to place.  if i'm back for a visit to peoria, i still choose this location to meet him for lunch.it's the same as any other bww.  tvs everywhere, great wings, and okay service.  i have to admit that i'm a fan.  i think their wing flavors are excellent and i love that they have such a wide variety to choose from.  i prefer the boneless wings and typically only visit for lunch.  their dinner prices are a little higher."
"overpriced wings, they are really proud of them! beer is pricey. food is generally good. i really like the buffalo chips! i gave 3 stars for the fact it overpriced!"
neighborhood bar feel.   great local hangout without the local jeeks.  this bww is s bit pricey but it keeps the barflys away.  this is a corporate run restaurant and it's always clean and consistently good.
"wife, wings and gamecock football  wonderful staff who pit sec primetime football on large screen"
"i've always enjoyed bdubs, i recommend calling ahead due to it can get a bit busy at times. the service has been good the time i've been there, and plenty of beer to choose from. plenty of tv's in the place so you can watch some sports while you enjoy your food which isnt bad, well i haven't complained about my choice in food.i normally get the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich with mild sauce and i recommend it, it's pretty good.this one looks like any other bdubs i've been too so nothing different."
"finally great food and service at a buffalo wild wings restaurant. our waitress was really nice and was always making sure we had refills. we didn't have to wait long at all for our food and the whole restaurant was pretty clean. out of the many locations i've been to, this was definitely the best."
"kate is an amazing waitress - like a movie star. but, i must say, i am done with bww boneless wings. the last three times i've been here, the boneless taste and feel like they're three days old. the killian's on tap was amazing though! one star for food, but five for kate and killian's!"
"oh buffalo wild wings.  if you have been to a bww before you know what to expect.  this one in particular may be a little below bww standards because it is old, small, and loud even without some big event playing on their tvs.  if you haven't been to a bww before, don't expect to be amazed.  service is generally slow, wait staff is rarely attentive, and their food is just ok.  in addition to that you can expect to pay a pretty penny for a hand full of wings unless you go on one of their wing ""sale"" nights.  i understand the low ratings for all bww in lubbock, and it makes sense because the service, pricing and atmosphere is the same at each location.  that being said, if you go to bww don't get your hopes up and expect a big tab for the food and drinks received, and with that in mind you will be content with what you get."
"terrible service. you'll be there about two hours waiting for food even if it's not busy. to avoid eating there i like to get it to-go but the order is always wrong the first time, so it's important to check before you leave"
"well they got rid of the best thing on the menu the hummus with celery bell pepper and kalamata olives. went there 01/20/ 2018 they took forever to get our order out never have i waited that long on their busiest night.  i told the guy who brought our food out finally man it took them long enough to butcher that cow didn't it? he smiled and agreed. then he must have told the manager who came out to ask us if everything was ok and we said the food is good it just took forever to get the order out. he said "" i'm sorry we're really busy tonight"" however they weren't full i've been there on a saturday when they were busting at their seam meaning the dinning the patios and the bar was to the max full standing room only! and they weren't slow then!?! very insincere  apology from the manger all together."
bad service! waiting time is ridiculous 2 hours waiting for our food!! don't come here!
"wow. worst service ever. waitress barely said a total of ten words the whole night. rude the whole time. dirty tables, unprofessional staff. disappointed. won't be back."
"as a former server, bartender, host, manager, literally anything you could be in the service industry, this was probably the worst service i've ever experienced. it's 6 pm, saturday night- ok i get it, they're somewhat busy. however not busy enough to neglect your table for an hour and a half, forget about an appetizer, and the 2 min of interaction we got throughout the entire time we were there, server was undeniably rude. careless and inattentive. when we spoke to the manager he had little to nothing to say. ""oh yeah, uh i'm sorry 'bout that."" and nothing else. won't be back again."
waitress was really nice! food came out hot. super pleased with my experience
when you order pick up....go through every item.  our lemon pepper wings were not dusted with enough season....we took it back and there was no customer service.  he didn't want to give us a fresh order...tried to redust the wings so they became goopy and clumped with the season.  we ordered close to $90 worth of food and he told us it was our fault because we didn't check the whole order before we left.
"wow!!! waiter does not know anything about the menu, tanqueray (he thought was vodka, and took over 30 min to get our food. realistically it is the managers fault for not training his staff. i have been to over 20 other locations and this place is clueless."
fast food wings!!! the service isn't always good or fast. for what you pay it should be better...
"this location is the worst. if you expect to be treated with respect and dignity at a place where you spend your hard earned money please choose another option. i go here mainly because it is the closest location to where i stay. however, when i go there i am treated beneath a paying customer. on numerous occasions i have been talked to rudely or given delayed service when they were slow. the general manager, jared, makes it his business to not speak to me and see how my experience is going. though will greet nearby tables and guest at the bar. also, when i order my food or drinks the bartender messes up my order seemingly intentional. yesterday is a prime example.....i was made to wait over 10 minutes for a beer refill while sitting at the bar top. at the same time guest around me were being serviced with multiple refills before the bartender would even look my way. then i placed a to go order because i was fed up with the poor customer service...only to receive it incorrectly. for years there have been rumors about this location being the absolute worst in the city and after the countless experiences i can confirm these negative comments. save yourself the trouble and go further down 82nd st. to the wolforth location. it's nicer looking inside and out and the service is at least subpar at worst which is better than being treated like you are unwelcome."
"i go here maybe once a month to get cheap delicious wings. they never disappoint. they have 65 cents a piece traditional wings on tuesdays and 65 cent boneless wings on thursdays. what a deal! my favorite thing to do is sit in the outer patio area that is still technically inside, but it is free seating. this means no wait time and it is a little bit more quite out here. the wait staff here has been very nice and helpful every time i visit. the food is always warm and cooked through. i love the ranch here as well. i am a sucker for some good home made ranch. i am a big fan of there potato wedges as well. my husbands sticks to their shoe string like fries and loves them as well. if you want a flavor recommendation i would say get the parmesean garlic!"
"the wings were good but, i don't suggest paying with and tipping with a card- somehow my 20% tip was doubled when i checked my bank account. dishonest people."
"sigh. bdubs. what's up?? it's a tuesday. place is busy. i seat myself alone on the patio. waitress looks right at me twice. ignores me, for 20 minutes. i ask the hostess to reseat me. she says that's fine, but it's a 45 minute wait on food. eh?wings take a few minutes to fry, right?it'll be another few months before i give these guys a try again."
"cold beer, and cold wings. asked for cheese and bacon wedges, got regular fries. not coming back. maybe give the other location a shot"
i literally sat and times on my phone how fast a waiter or waitress would come serve us and ask for our drinks or apps.... mind you i started my timer after sitting there three minutes or so and i stopped my timer 4:26 secs because i got pissed and impatient.. i asked for a manager and told him about the situation.. i love bww wings and atmosphere but the service at this location is horrible. this has happened before and we will not be coming back to this location
"prices have gone through the roof. 1 drink costs more than a twelve pack! and prices for chicken is ridiculous, just go to a classy establishment, it won't cost any more."
"i gave this bww another chance being that it is im my neighborhood and being that i enjoyed going here with friends for happy hour and good food back in the day. but since that time other bwws have opened and unfortunately continue to be better than this location.food was not good. my boneless wings were not fresh. they had to have been sitting out for 30 minutes or so before being sauced and given to me. i ate 3 of the hard wing nuggets and it was ""check please"".  i can't describe the texture or taste other than to say gritty parmesean gravy with a hint of sour after taste. dramatic but yet so true. cheese fries were good. service was meh. also the chairs could use a good wipe down with bleach, soap, & water...very sticky when scooting in to the table. i hope things turn around for this location but i won't be going back anytime soon."
"the staff is friendly, the food is decent, but it's usually not a place i choose to go to. it is a popular destination though, which apparent by the crowds of people that go there. i haven't gone when they've shown a big event, but it might be a good place to go watch a fight or a game on the big screen."
"the place was undermanned. around 11 pm we went to this location and when we got there we were told we can sit anywhere by a waiter and that he will be with us shortly. the place wasn't busy. it had 5 occupied tables and 2 male staff members who were cokin' and jokin'. we sat down and waited for 10 minutes. no one showed up to our table to greet us or anything. so, my wife and i got up and left. managers, i know it wasn't that busy but train your people on a sense of urgency. my wife and i enjoy bww, but this location has lost our vote of going back. take accountability and take charge."
"definitely disappointing for a familiar chain. i think the service and food is lacking and need to be reconsidered. it took around 3 hours to get a table of 5 people eating. we ordered the average fries with boneless and wings combos, and got back lower expectations. the wings were poorly sauced and the fries were cold. for a tuesday night, this could have used some improvement. will stick with lubbock's wing stop from now on."
"this bww is very dirty and run down.  there is trash all over the floor.  the table is not wiped down.we arrived at 9:45.  not many people.  service was terrible.  took forever to get appetizers.  took even longer to get beer.  we had 2 appetizers, 3 beers, and 4 orders of wings.  our bill is was $100.  very overpriced the whole experience.  very disappointed."
"i've been here a couple times and am not a huge fan. i got the boneless chicken wings with the garlic flavor. it was literally just buffalo sauce. i didn't taste any garlic in it. my friends got the asian zing which was actually amazing. i would only come here to watch games. the food isn't that great. but if you do come for the wings, i highly recommend asian zing."
"my family and i use too eat at this establishment before tonight. we were seated quickly because at this time of night they were not busy . the waitress came right over and seemed promising. ended up placing our order within 5 -10 minutes of sitting down . the room started filling up by then . over an hour later the waitress comes and tells us our food was never put in and she needs to take our order again . i then tell her we are leaving and she said i will get your check . that's right... made us pay for the drinks tea ,lemonade and 2 beers . told the manager that it was unacceptable and he said what am i supposed to do about it . needless to say we will never eat at these establishments again. this bww and the employeesin lubbock texas are the type of people that kneel for the national anthem ."
"met the college aged kid here last night. wow. the staff quit caring at 9 pm, sadly i was there at 10.we were ignored at our table for about 15 minutes before someone came to check up on us. ordered two beers, a shiner and something more exotic. it took another ten minutes for that to arrive. after i drank it i told my better half it tasted just like shiner and i should have just had one of those. she laughed and told me i was served her shiner bock and the beer i ordered sucked... lol..the fried pickles were tasteless. uninspired. tiny green sliver in a lot of breading. same thing for the chicken wings. you'd expect a restaurant that has ""wings"" in their name to know what they are doing but that certainly isn't the case here. i'd say 60% breadcrumbs and 40% chicken. sadly the chickens they used were from the retirement home. their wings had about 100,000 flight hours on them and were tough, stringy and just plain yucky. the ""garlic parmesan"" part of the chicken was some kind of secret sauce that covered about 30% of the wings and tasted like yesterdays ragout. no garlic, no parmesan.all in al this place is crap. sure it's clean, but who cares when the food sucks and you get the wrong beers. luckily there's so many tv's in the place a conversation with the rest of the crew at your table is virtually impossible."
"came in a little after 9pm on a monday... couldn't even get someone to take our drink order. saw at least 5 different waiters and no one would even look our way. wasn't terribly busy either. needless to say, we left."
"the poorest service and dirtiest bww i have ever seen.  stood in bar area for 10 min with 5 dirty tables and wait staff saw us standing and waiting and did not even attempt to clean a table, walked up to the front to be sweets and after 3 min a wait staff finally asked us if we had been helped. when we said no, the said sit over there somewhere, and pointed.... dirty chairs at tables, smelly atmosphere.... disgusting!"
we love coming here for some food! i got my first legal drink here because i turned 21 that night and they waited to serve me till then. they are super nice and if you want cheep drinks ask for their beer of the month
"can't leave an honest review because i didn't eat here. called with questions about the mobile site because it doesn't indicate how many wings, and the girl who answered the phone didn't know what i was talking about. she placed me on hold to ask her manager and gave me info on a completely different menu item. when i said i think we're discussing different menu items, she just came back with well that's what my manager said and didn't offer to find out the answer to my question. won't be ordering from this particular location ever because apparently customer service and knowing your menu aren't important."
"the food had far too much sauce, on both the wingless and traditional wings. the waitresses were busy gossiping and all siting in one both while the restaurant remained dirty. we had no silverware for about 15 minutes until we were finally able to flag down a server.did i mention one of the wings had feathers on it? yes feathers."
bdubs is one of my favorite spots to watch sports and this one did not disappoint. we ordered our usual order of dry wings with sauces on the side. the wait staff was super friendly and attentive. this is a great place to eat and watch sports!
i've been going to this bww for 4 years since i moved from ny to lubbock for grad school. i've never been denied a beer since i've turned 21 (and now i am 24 years old). i am from ny so i have a ny license and today my waitress and manager both refused me a beer because they would not take my out of state license. i am incredibly disappointed and will not be returning to this bww ever again.
honestly this place is not worth it. the only good thing about it was the beer. table and dining area extremely dirty. order fried pickles they had way to much butter. we also got wings and a cheddar burger. both were dry and the bacon in the burger was burn.
"walked in to immediately be greeted by absolutely no one. just stood there waiting to be seated for a good 10-15 minutes. finally a mimelike employee walked up and looked at us awkwardly without saying anything. ""table for three"" we replied. after he snapped out of a gloomy haze, it hit him and he quickly darted off to clean a corner booth. there were plenty of open booths and tables but they were bound and determined to give us this one. he came back and seated us in a musty corner booth where we sat and waited 30 minutes before our waitress to showed up. we came to watch the tech game which was nationally televised on espn but they had old classic college football games, poker, and other garbage on the tvs instead. we politely asked them to turn the tech game on but i guess they had to find someone that knew how to operate a remote and change a channel. they finally got the channel switched over to the game but they were still blaring techno at 1000 decibels. had to ask them to play the audio of the tech game but they turned it to the audio of a completely different channel. with time and determination, they finally got the audio switched over. the food finally came out but the order was wrong. sent it back to the kitchen and waited longer. had to stare at a dirty floor while i ate. bathrooms were dirty. overall superb experience!"
exceptionally slow. took a hour to get chicken wings when the shop was only 1/3 full. music so loud you could not talk at the table. this used to be a good place. there are too many good places to eat around here to waste time here.
"wow the cook loves his microwave!!!!! oh and a double isn't a four second pour fyi, don't waste your time the place is going down hill fast.  third time wasn't a charm, done and done.  you will never see my money again......"
can't get orders done on time promised on the website. waited 20 minutes over with kids in the car. no apology forthcoming. poor customer service
"holy cow they were slow and clueless. we had a large group and it took and hour and 15 min to get our food. no idea whose food was whose. no idea how to match up kid with parent. brought out appetizers with the meal and said, ""i thought it was a side"". glad i don't live near here. poor training. 30 min and still trying to figure out the bill. the 20 year olds thought they knew better than the 50 year olds that have been dealing with large groups for almost as long as they have been alive."
"ate here a few months back and got the garlic parmesan sauce in my wrap, had food poison all next day. tried it again with my boyfriend last night and he got the garlic parmesan wings. he has food poisoning today. i would not recommend eating that flavor, or ever going back."
"food was good however the dude working the hostess station didn't say a word when we walked in. i said 2 please and he grabbed the silverware and walked off and put them in the table and went back to his station without a word. waitress was decent. food runner brought us our app and left without asking if we needed anything else. i could understand that if they were busy, but they weren't. food was good though and our server made up for the lackluster performance by the host and food runner."
"food is usually good, but service varies with slower and less attentive than expected being the norm. things do seem to be improving"
"i'm really disappointed with the downturn of this location. we came in tonight (tuesday night) with our two kids for dinner. when we came in, it took several minutes to be greeted by a half-interested hostess. she didn't smile, welcome us, and she seemed almost put out because she had to seat us. we were sat in the southeast corner booth which happens to be right under speakers. our waitress, kayla, came to take our drink order. (i only know her name because it was printed on our receipt, not because she introduced herself.) she came back to take our food order and it took quite a while to get our food. in the meantime, what appeared to be a manager came over to turn the music up. again, it wasn't busy and there were many empty tables. after a few minutes of not being able to hear a conversation at our table, i asked a different hostess (much nicer) to see if someone could turn it down which no one ever did. back to food. we were missing part of our order so our waitress came back to bring that, but never came back to check how the food was or check on our drinks. my husband finally flagged her down to get me more water. i ordered the mango habanero wings and they are up there on the heat scale. my water (both glasses) tasted dirty, like the nozzle needed to be cleaned. another serious item to note is the water temp in the women's restroom. the faucets are motion sensored with no way to change the temperature. it's far too hot for an adult, let alone children who need to wash their hands. this should be checked. my husband reported the men's restroom trash can was overflowing with paper towels, and there were paper towels in the urinal. overall, there is no reason these things should have been issues in a tuesday night w a half full restaurant. i can understand these occurring in a busy game day, but this is not an acceptable way to manage or run a franchised restaurant that has standards and protocols for training staff and serving patrons. corporate needs to pay attention to all 3 lubbock locations and figure out what's going on."
"we went to this one at like 9 pm on a weekday and it was so freaking loud with the game on i couldn't even hear the people talking that we went with. the service was so bad and she got our orders all wrong because she couldn't hear us. my bf got a dos equis and there was no lime and the other couple we went with got bloody mary's and there was no garnish at all for it (olives, celery, pickle) and we asked the waiter to get us some and 20 min later after we drank it she brought us like a pickle and celery stick. she never filled up our waters and would walk by acting like she didn't see our cups on the end of the table. my friend had to get up and go get water from the bartender and she complained to them. they did apologize but i won't be going back to this one ever again."
"the service was friendly, not fast by any stretch of the imagination but friendly nonetheless.  that is the only good part of the visit.  this is our third time and thank god they have tablets for the kids.  otherwise the wait time would be excruciating.  it just seems to be an overall lazy careless attitude.  from the other reviews it looks like that characteristic is passed down from management.  too bad.  bww can take a backseat to wing stop from now on and rightfully so.  our last, and i mean very last visit, was marred with cold chicken wings (when sent back) replaced with more cold wings unpleasantly drowned in sauce and apparently made the previous week.  if you can't figure out how to reheat chicken wings you're in the wrong business.  if you're trying to save food costs by serving left over wings or anything that resembles leftover reheated trash then i won't waste my money.  i won't wax nostalgic about the days when bww was decent.  until ownership pays attention to their business and gets rid of weak link management and starts serving fresh made warm food this place will be a 1 star restaurant.  it has now been 0 days since i left a restaurant without eating.  damn you..."
looks like a retirement home here. waitress staff was slow. only saw her waitress 2 times in 3 hrs. wet naps smell like mildew and piss
"first time back in a few months due to a bad experience last time in.much improved this time! wings were hot, very hot, and tasty. service was great! we will be coming back more often as long as you keep up the level of service and food you had tonight. good job!"
"worst wings in town, best everything else. try wingstop if you really like wings. if you want to go to a ""bar"" that also has wings... bww is ok"
we ordered 2-5pc wings 1-teriyaki and 1- honey bbq and we were short 1 teriyaki wing on our order. we took our order home and found the shortage there. why can't folks pay attention to their work and get the order right. the young lady opened it up and checked and gave it to my wife tolling her our order was right and ready to go. the wings were really good and tasty and we look forward to ordering them again with some potato wedges.
i have had similar negative experiences here same as the others have posted but i just had to try it one more time. happy to say it was much better. good service hot food. relieved that i didn't give up on it since i live out this way.
very dirty place. food on the floors under tables. no signs of waitstaff cleaning anything up. game tablets were out or almost out of batteries. bathroom had paper towels and toilet paper everywhere.  i can only imagine that if the front of the house was this messy what the kitchen looks like. try a different place and done bother going here!
"bad experience. highly unprofessional manager.the store had a policy that i've never heard of at other bww, and there was no indication so i ordered what i usually do and was surprised when the tab came back double what i'm used to. the server was super polite about it, but didn't have the power to do anything about it. the manager came over and was a giant butthole about it. just kept repeating the same phrase regardless of what i said like some sort of broken robot. no one goes to bww cause the food is the best, if they're also going to be run by a bunch of jerks then forget this place."
this is the nicest and cleanest buffalo wild wings in/near lubbock. the service can be slow but the wings are usually good once served and they have pretty good drink prices during happy hour. definitely my favorite of the bwws around town.
"great place and staff. tonite was different. servers standing around doing nothing, for the entire time we were there. we sat at the bar. the bartenders are great and work hard. our fries were cold and had to sent back. we were half way through meal before we got more. why can't the servers doing nothing help the bartenders with running food, or cleaning off dirty dishes? if i were the manger i would have sent them home if all they were gone to do is stand around. looked bad and unprofessional. again, complaint not with our bartender. they are always on the ball and work their butts off."
"great location.  service better than most bww, except for water refills.  food came out fast and at the correct temperature, but two of three orders did not match the menu for the sides.  we did not complain as we preferred the fries over the chips.  the tortillas seemed stale.  i wanted to give the business a try after a bad 19th st experience and since the owner is local.  however, maybe it's an ok place to go watch a game and have adult drinks, but otherwise, it's worth the drive elsewhere.  please clean the menus.  nothing worse than sticky menus.  the chairs are not ergo and are uncomfortable.  they look good, though."
"this should be a no star. the service is ultra lousy, and the food was disgusting at best. please avoid this place. i know i will."
"got a togo order here tonight, tried a new sauce, and got home and there literally was no sauce on them, pretty disappointed in the way the manager on duty handled the situation, he was very rude. didn't care what so ever. as a mother that's always on the go i would've loved to sit down and enjoy my dinner. i was a loyal customer here but for now i'll stop going and let my friends know as well."
"the girl at the front completely ignored us standing there and took forever to seat us even though there were many open tables. our waiter would ask how we were doing as he rushed by without actually stopping. i said we were done one time, and he said ok as he ran by. we waited and waited, but he didn't bring our check and we didn't see him again for a long, long time. he finally came back, but he didn't have our check. i asked him to bring it, and he finally did and we were able to get out of there."
buffalo wild wings wolfforth the service sucks there were only 3 people in the hole place sat at the bar  for over 10 minutes nobody would wait on me moved to a table the waitress walk right by me didn't even ask me if i been waited on  i don't see how this place is still open the worst wild wings in texas
"not only the worst bww i've been to but the worst restaurant i've ever been too.  i've give this location 3 chances now and every single time it's the same poor service and cold food.  i certainly would not wait even 5 minutes to be seated at this dump.  so the times i've been there were not busy at all and the service still sucks.  on our most recent visit, our waitress took our order then went to sit in the bar at a table with a couple dinning and never returned until after we finished eating.  which did not take me long since my wings were cold when brought out.  i had to go find my own tea refill and go to the bar to buy another beer.  there is such a lack of leadership at this location it is obvious.  it's no wonder they rarely have a crowd at this location and it's about the only place to sit down and eat with a bar around wolfforth.  it can't stay open long under the current management."
went there two nights in a row.  both nights sat for 10 minutes and never got waited on.  second night i went and spoke to the manager and he could care less.  we left and will never be back.
nice spot. big wings and lots of sauce. it's been awhile since i've eaten at one and i feel like the sauces have gotten hotter. good flavor still. great place to watch a game and have a few beers and wings.
"this place never disappoints.  service,,, food,,, and atmosphere.  call me crazy but it's darn good in my book"
"i love the food at buffalo wild wings but this is the slowest kitchen of any i've been to. 45 minutes for a carry out order, and the place isn't even busy! horrible."
"ordered a quesadilla with no chicken for lunch. called after we submitted the order to confirm that there wouldn't be chicken on it. said nothing about omitting the cheese. when we got back to eat lunch there was nothing inside the ""quesadilla"" except pico de gallo. several other items were also left out from our order."
why no ufc fight like every other bw3? because the manager said? too bad. disappointing as i like their food. this location is ridiculously over packed.
"food is okay. tables are dirty. menus are all sticky. bathroom smelled really bad. rock on sioux city. also check your silverware, the last costumers meal was still on mine."
"i don't mind this place, but it isn't a place i tell my husband, ""oh, let's go to bww!"" typically when i go it's for a large group or someone else's idea. i worked here for a stint when i was younger. the back is very clean. hopefully it is still now!i love the parmesan-garlic wings. omg they're great. fries suck. nachos are good. dessert nachos are amazing!service is typically ok. had a great experience with large groups, but if it's during a busy game or just 2-3 of us, service sucks. decent drink prices during happy hour. otherwise this place sucks to drink at. i love their queso and the ranch they have is awesome. don't crave it, don't absolutely love it, but don't hate it. their honey bbq is spicy!"
"shocking that employees wanna go home, and push us out. we have been here less then an hour. it's 9:45 now. thought this place stays open late??? guess we just got wrong waitress. no problem. go somewhere else:)"
great service and food every time!the staff are always friendly and prompt. fun place to meet up with a friend for a quick lunch or to hang for awhile.
"you know, you siouxlanders need to start yelpin'!!! how on earth am i a first review for bww??good boneless wings and sauces. good fries... wedges are especially tasty. sports everywhere except the water in the toilet bowl... that is where the beer goes. basic sports bar with a direction/theme. i like that. you know what you are gonna get."
"it's bdubs.you go for wings and beer.  this is a great place for kids cuz you can't really hear much farther than across the table. you aren't really worried about disturbing your neighbor and dads can drink a beer and talk football and mom's can smile and bare it.hard for me to rate this place low, cuz what am i comparing it to?  they have about 15 sauces and a few seasonings, and then you have boneless and traditional. as far as wings in the area, you have bob roe's and townhouse, both similar to eachother.  their sauces are a bit baked on and pretty good too, but townhouse atmosphere is a bit dated and dingy.  they also have decent fries, wedges with cheese, fried pickles, etc.  i have not had a burger here but have had the wrap and paired with some asian zing, tasty."
"great atmosphere for watching sports, but i wish they could turn the monitors down a bit. when you're telling across the table it's not a great experience. oh, and waiting 45 minutes for food on a sunday afternoon (12:45) is a little ridiculous. and then only bringing 3 of the 4 meals. 4th meal delivered 15 minutes later. yikes. we were comped a bit, but seriously?! how do u expect people to return knowing they're loud, slow, and food is usually cold."
love the place!! beer and wings it just don't get better then that. then got about 25 different flavors for you wings and t.v.'s everywhere so u won't miss your game at game time!!!
food seems overpriced for what you actually get. if you dine during peak hours you almost have to scream across the table to be heard as it is a loud environment. the service also seems slow more times than not.
"another typical b-dubs! friendly but barely tentative staff due to being busy, the waitresses try their best though. good food, overpriced wings, and lots of football on the tv. i like coming here to watch nfl since there is no team near here. i'm willing to bet saturday gets crowded for ou games. clean place, good food, worth the hang out time."
the service was absolutely horrible. we weren't greeted when we came in. when we asked for a booth so it was easy just to slide our car seat in they told us it wasn't available and there were 3 that we saw open. our server that never gave us his name but every time we said anything wether ordering or asking for a refill he looked confused. food was okay. establishment was dirty and a lot of servers standing around talking. ‍ we will go to a different location next time.
as i walk in i was 'greeted' by a girl named hailey. she had the worst case of rbf i've ever seen. she did not make us feel welcomed in the slightest. she stood there the whole time with her unsatisfied face and her arms crossed. the phone would ring and she would walk away. then a manager took our to go order. after waiting for about 30 mins we reviewed the food to find 3 things missing from our order. i normally love this place. i tried a different location which was a horrible mistake. would not recommend.
"it was okay. i was very unaware that we would have. 30 minute wait on a sunday for a lunch date (something different) type of date. we went they had a wait. and instead of waiting there was open seating in bar area... i am from missouri/kansas..you can't smoke in restaurants...here i'm moore oklahoma that's not the case. it was super smoke filled and because my spouse was hungry we stayed. our clothes suffered and so did our eyes and lungs. you can smoke in the bar area...but no cigar or pipe smoking. clearly i wasn't prepared. we will think twice before returning. it was hard to enjoy the food with all the smoke. very foggy in there. just my opinion. respectfully,bryan smith-moore ok"
"my husband and i have been to this location about 3 or 4 times, continuing to give them chances, however, tonight was just beyond ridiculous. my husband and i placed an online order that was supposed to be ready at 11:40pm. he drove to pick it up, arriving around 11:35. he paid for our order and waited until midnight to receive our order. there was one other person waiting for an online order. the only way we got our order, was after my husband saw our food sitting in the window for at least five minutes before my husband and the other customer approached the staff asking if that was their orders. the waitress threw our food in the bag, so we had a big saucey mess when we got home. he also had to ask for extra sauce, which was requested in our order to begin with. no apologizes or updates from any staff. i ordered buffalo chips as a side and got like half of an order's worth. what a waste of money. no more chances bww...to wing stop we go."
"called and ordered wings today for pickup, which were delicious. great choices on sauces, i like my wings extra crispy, bone on ""traditional""  with habanero and pineapple on the side. blazing hot! my son likes the wings the same way with their hot sauce on the side as well. the wife loves the wings prepared wet in the sauce hot as well. our  young daughter likes the wings extra crispy with no sauce. my only complaint is the price, over a dollar a wing. since when do wings cost more than a dollar a piece? the food was ready as promised when i arrived, the take out employee was cheerful, she had me on my way quickly. it will just be a while before i purchase wings again.   i think psychologically they try to downplay the cost, you buy a snack size, or medium, or large but the menu doesn't list the number of wings, you have to ask. expensive."
well was not to happy the place was really dirty and the table they sat us at was not cleaned the seat and table had wing sauce all over it. the service was horrible she was rude and did not even ask if we needed anything just took our order and we got our appetizer and food all at once not cool. the food was cold and bland the reason i gave a one star is because the pretzel appetizer was good. i don't recommend this place !
this is my ultimate favorite location its the best they actually do the lunch special for us which is awesome i love it i hope they keep it up and we will keep coming  and the food is always so fresh and so yummy this is the best location ever
"service was overall not that great and the food was not as good as what i expect from buffalo wild wings.  the boneless wings i ordered with the dry rub came with it poured on top, and not the underside of any of the boneless chicken making me think they didn't rotate or even try to cover them.  the cheese curds were overall decent, but not the quality i expect. lastly the service was pretty crappy, the waitress had an attitude with us, and we ordered fries we never received.  now i will say with food this review would be 3 stars but with service and cleanliness it is below.  we ordered fries as i mentioned, when the woman came out to give us our food we mentioned we never got our fries, she went in the back, and when she came out she said to our waitress there's no fries, and the waitress goes, oh well too late now forget it and walked away.  granted this was not near our table but you could hear what they were saying.  the other annoying part is that the bathrooms were not really clean, the smell from the men's bathroom was a combination of mildew, pee and bo. granted it is a men's bathroom, but never in my life did i smell something so bad i thought twice about having to use the bathroom."
"service isn't so great here...only had good service once or twice out of like 10 times going. i only go on tuesdays or thursdays for the cheaper wings. drinks are okay as well, but it's good to come here for late eats since most places close around 9 or 10."
"food: 1/5service: 1/5cleanliness: 1/5decor & style: 2/5first, see my bw3 south okc review here yelp.com/user_details_re…this place in moore is identical! this place smell's like wet mop! just like the sw okc location. in addition, we had a server that was very slow and gave us the whole ""sorry i have wayy too many tables"" spiel. that's on management always stacking their servers.again, i go here because friends pick this place, i sure wouldn't!2/5 star because the wing sauce is not too bad, otherwise an easy 0 star place. all other foods i tasted were subpar as well. 2/5 star for decor because they have multiple tvs and is beneficial for sporting events, however this place (all locations) look outdated (1990's sports bar look)."
"rude staff! first of all they got our order wrong and the waitress was snooty and unhelpful. second, my daughter has special needs and sensitive hearing. the other customers were very rude and inconsiderate. they screamed very loudly because of a game that was on. this is not a family friendly restaurant and definitely not the place for special needs children with sensitive hearing! we will not go back again!"
"saturday night at 7pm. 45 minute wait for two people. there are over 20 people waiting for tables, i see at least 19 open tables. really??  not sure if it's worth the wait. looks very disorganized and dirty. we will see.  obviously management is lacking. i wish i could attach a picture."
maybe the wosrt device that i have ever had at a bb wings empty tables and took us an hour to get food would not recommend this place at all just terrible
"buffalo wild wings is already a complete rip off, but this location takes the crown for ""worst bww in the world.""we visited on a saturday night. the place was pretty crowded, but usually it is at anytime. we waited for an hour and a half for four orders of wings and two orders of fried. an hour and a half.when the wings arrived, they were all cold as were the fries. we sent them back and got a new order within 5 minutes. even though the first time it took an hour and a half.i sent a complaint to the manager, and he refused to admit that this happened and claimed that i was making it up. what a horrible manager, location and company. save your money and time and go anywhere else. seriously, mcdonald's is better than this place."
i rated one star because of our visit but changed it to two because another member of staff (not our waitress) made it a point to address our horrible service to a manager and the manager comp'd 8 dollars off our tab.  we went in at about midnight on a tuesday and were sat immediately. we were the only ones there.  our waitress took our order and drink order.  in the next 45 minutes 4-5 other parties arrived.  at least 3 of those parties ordered food after us and received their food before us.  we still hadn't seen our waitress.  someone else brought out our food.  i brought it to their attention and they brought the manager out.  only then did our waitress reappear blaming it on bar staff making her wait 45 minutes for drinks. i'm not sure where the bar is located but apparently its 22.5 minutes away. by far the worst bww chain i've been to.
"i'm struggling to find out why this location has such abysmal reviews. i came on tuesday, was seated promptly, ordered, and my wings and drink were delivered quickly. my wild traditional wings tasted like they usually do; so far no problems with service or quality control.for what it's worth i think it's perfectly fine as far as bww goes."
"i have been here multiple times, but this is the first time i've been here after joining yelp. usually, the service is great. i don't know if it was because i was being serviced by high school females, because i was with a handsome male, or because the girls were just tired - maybe a combination of all three. i was treated as a customer that walked in the door just minutes before they closed, although they didn't close for another 3 hours.  we left probably at least half an hour before i normally would have because terrible customer service just makes for a terrible mood. and tip, in my opinion.although the place was all but dead, we had to wait for one of the 3 employees standing near the front to notice us so that we could be seated. they didn't feel like working, so they just stared at us until the hostess walked back from the bathroom. she asked, ""two?"" and then promptly turned and walked to a booth against the wall, set the menus down, and walked off without saying another word to us. normally i don't care where i sit, but their flat wooden benches are a pain in my ass - literally. the waitress finally showed up to our table to take our orders, but had a hard time listening to what we were saying and answering out questions. i had to get up to ask for a to-go box, which was thrown onto the table upon delivery, and again to ask for our check.at this point, i was fuming; so i went out to the car while my boyfriend paid and spared the girls the wrath of veronica - and probably gave a nice tip, the good samaritan!"
have you been to a bww before? just like every other chain this one hits the mark. nothing special and nothing that will bring me back. the giant tvs are nice to catch a game.
"first off, i love buffalo wild wings. this review is specifically about this location.i visited on 2/4/16 with a group for dinner. our waitress, meagan, was... well, i want to be nice and say she was ""flighty"" or ""absentminded"", but honestly, i just think she was just high. which, whatever-- if you can handle yourself, that's none of my business. but that wasn't the case here. she kept forgetting things she said she'd bring over, and coming back to ask us what she'd left to get. then asking the same people repeatedly if they wanted another beer, even after they'd already said yes. there was a whole long, drawn-out debacle with her bringing two people in out party the wrong beer and when she replaced it, brought them the exact same wrong beer. and spent way too long explaining that this wasn't her fault. still, all this is not enough for me to really be too upset-- i mean, we got our food and drinks in a reasonable amount of time, and the appetizers came out well before the entrees, which was very nice.here's what got me on this visit, and will probably keep me from ever going back here: hair.so much hair, everywhere.without exaggeration, 95% of the servers i saw in the restaurant (and there were a lot on this night, because it was ""boneless thursday-- 65 cent boneless wings-- and they were extra busy) had long hair, and most were not restraining it in any way, whatsoever. nary a barrette nor a headband in sight. our waitress had particularly scuzzy-looking hair-- and i don't mean that as an indictment of her personal hygiene so much as an explanation of why it was so distressing when she kept touching in and flipping it over our food and beverages. at one point, a person in my party actually reached out and moved their items out from under this barrage, but she didn't seem to notice due to the aforementioned absent-mindedness.now, i have worked in food service. i wouldn't feel right posting some of the reviews that i do if i hadn't. my husband currently works as a server. so i'm familiar with the rules of food service. and i was pretty sure that local health codes don't allow this kind of thing. so i texted my husband, who's just had to re-certify his food handler's permit, and asked. he tells me, yes, long hair has to be pulled back and either braided or up off of the collar. now, just to see if he was wrong, i googled bww's employee handbook (""playbook"") to see what it said. if you are interested, it said this: ""... your hair needs to be pulled back and restrained if there is any chance it could fall forward over your shoulders.""now, this could be an outdated version of their rules that i'm looking at, but i'm thinking that not having hair in your food is a pretty universal desire of dining patrons everywhere, so i imagine this rule, along with county health codes, haven't changed any time recently.and yet almost every single server in the restaurant had hair that was way past their shoulders, and right in front, dangling over customers' food.someone in my group said ""maybe they don't serve the food-- maybe it is runners from the kitchen."" reasonable. but, sadly, this was not the case. this girl, who had touched her (sorry, but...) dirty-looking hair multiple times in front of us, did in fact serve us our food. which, if you're not familiar with bww, comes in little paper ""boats"" that they pretty much have to put their fingers inside of in order to serve it to you. so, hair-fingers in the boats. hair flying everywhere. just hair, hair, hair.there was a manager on duty, so this didn't seem to be a case of the mice playing while the cat was away. so obviously, he's aware of this but doesn't enforce it. regardless, i didn't want to stop my group on the way out to remind him of the health codes and bww rules he's clearly breaking.so sure, i am pregnant and i haven't had my flu shot yet, which makes me particularly sensitive to food safety and germs right now. but c'mon, if you're not a fan of other peoples' hair near / around / in your food, you might just want to steer clear of this location altogether. and if they're this lax about things that are open and obvious to customers, i can't imagine what they're doing in the kitchen, behind closed doors."
"i usually don't believe bad reviews especially when it comes to big franchises such as buffalo wild wings but this time i should have listened to other people. this was not my best experience with wings. i had the buffalo, thai and garlic wings with wedge and a drink. way over priced and not really special taste. interior is really amazing and decent service."
"this bww has horrific service. i went to pick up a to go order tonight and when i came in the hostess didn't notice me at first, loudly said ""shit"" when she saw me and then promptly left. i was then ignored for the next 10 minutes while four employees walked back and forth from where i was. after seeing me wait, the same girl game back and went to help the other couple who got there long after me. i ended up waiting 20 minutes for my order, which was a whole size smaller than i ordered. annoying."
orders are disjointed which is disappointing since its slow. maybe that's  why. some were done while others are still waiting. pretty bad.
"for the most part, bww offers some various menu options. i always enjoy their boneless wings and burgers. one thing that this location struggles to offer is great service. the wait time is ridiculous and we are often not attended to for about 5-10 minutes. the staff always appear stressed and rushed. they definitely need to work on their customer service."
"let me start by saying, i like buffalo wild wings. i think they're food is good, and their lunch special is a great value. today my friends and i went to have lunch here. we found a feather on one of our traditional wings. when we alerted our waiter, he was very apologetic and went to get the manager. the manager didn't even apologize. he just asked if we wanted another wing. we, of course, had lost our appetite. he then very rudely said ""okay well what should i do then?"" our gracious waiter asked the manager if he could at least discount our meal and the manager reluctantly took $2 off the ticket. cameron brown is a poor manager without good customer service skills. i've been given a complimentary meal for smaller mistakes. very disappointed."
"terrible service!! 2nd time visiting this location which is in walking distance of my house. went once when it first opened and the service was terrible and took forever to get our food. just stopped in for a beer, sat at the bar over 10 minutes and the 3 bartenders never even acknowledged us. it wasn't even busy, so disappointing."
"new bww located in east edmond off of i-35 next to sams is delicious! true to form, bww has big screen tvs from wall to wall and playing every sports game. this bww has a heated porch that faces the south and a nice variety of arcade games. competent staff and excellent appetizers like mini corn dogs, tacos, and prezetals. for wings, i recommend (and i always order) ordering the paramsian garlic sauce with blue cheese. don't forget to downloaded the app for the bww reward program. accumulate points by checking in, playing sports games, uploading receipts, and then redeem for menu items!"
came in today. all the servers had amazing attitudes! the food was just delicious! great prices! amazing tvs! i highkey recommend coming here!
"occasionally my husband or i will get a craving for bww. last night this happened, so i ordered for pick up. i ordered 18 boneless wings for him (honey bbq) and 6 boneless (mild) for me. i also ordered two side potato wedges. we had been working all day on renovating our house and were starving! should have checked the bag after i picked up the $35 worth of food (lol $35 for that...). what we actually got was two boats of potato wedges that were probably made 2 days ago. they were miraculous so hard to eat around the exterior and disgusting mush on the inside. the boneless wings. we received a total of 16 honey bbq, but that's only if you are also counting the one that was completely raw in the middle. so basically we paid $35 (plus $5 tip)... so $40 dollars for something we threw away and possibly contracted food poisoning. i get that this is a big box fast casual, but come on. have some standards."
"my family and i spontaneously decided to try this new bww's location for a casual friday night happy hour after not having dined at one of the franchises in years. arriving close to 6pm, we were told that the bar was open seating, so we picked a high top and started perusing the drink menu. and then we waited... and waited... for someone to come by and take our drink order. finally we flagged down a staff member, who appeared to be the manager. she was apologetic about the oversight and agreed to get our beer orders in herself. what appeared to be a generous draft menu did not actually represent what was on tap. we ended up getting the 'new ipa' the manager recommended, which was served cold and was good, so no complaints there. when our waitress finally arrived she appeared quite confused. in taking our food order she had to verify the choices 2-3 times and even returned to our table on multiple occasions to clarify. after another 45 minutes we finally got our food, which for all the notes/clarifications made by our waitress was not what we had ordered.during our wait, my family was surprised by how vacant the bar seemed for a friday night. now i think we know why. the beer was good, the food average but the bored/inattentive staff, outdated menus, and excessive wait times made for an overall unsatisfying experience. safe to say we won't be back."
"so we've been here twice so far.  i want to like it here but it's so slow it's crazy.  and they forget everything.  forget drinks, straws, even food to where i won't come back because the service is just that bad.  food is fine, it's just the service.  girls are sweet just more involved with talking to each other and on their phones.  really disappointed."
"poorly ran. we have given this bww multiple chances to redeem themselves and they continue to disappoint us. the togo orders are often wrong, the service dining in is mediocre at best and the food just never seems to be as good of quality as other buffalo wild wing restaurants. very disappointed because this is one of few restaurants close to our house, it would be nice if their food/service was better."
not bad! lots of sauce used on boneless wings! quick service. loved playing the games that are trivia and hooked up to the tv. good family or group of friends place to eat!
amazing tv setup one of the best bdubs i have visited.  wings were on point as usual and my server was a rockstar.
i love b dubs but the service at this one is terrible... i live a half mile from this location so when i heard it was being built i was stoked. but every time i have went something has been messed up. went a few days ago to watch the thunder game... all these tvs and not a single one playing thunder game. had to ask 3 times to get them to change one channel. good concept bad service
"we tried 2 different types of boneless wings, both were in the mild category, unfortunately, they were not mild, very strong pepper flavor. tried the salad, they drenched it in the dressing and was soggy  (we live about 5 minute's from location) never put dressing on the to go salad... fried pickles were not crispy. tried the big jack daddy w/fries. it was ok, but nothing special. first time we have tried a buffalo wild wings...very disappointed"
"waited 50min for wings!!!!   wings!!!!!!!!!  dump them in the fryer for 6-9 min and done. service is horrible. when are these owners going to get it right?????  such a scam. our bartender trina was pathetic, wrote our order wrong. had to repeat my order 3 times.  brutal. not coming back to this one!  beware."
"*sigh*i don't know why bww can't get their stuff together. this is a brand new location, but the service is terrible. my coworkers love the wings from bww, but i did not think (yet again) that they were delicious. i had very low expectations going in. i just wanted hot food that didn't taste bad. instead, we received poor service, and cold wings. i am sure i will come back (ie another work lunch probably) after they have been open a few more months to see if things are better. in theory, a nice new restaurant with big screens and a bar should be a fun place to watch the game and hang out - but bad food and bad service is inexcusable."
"i live east of i35 and when i saw that bww was opening up nearby, i was very excited, since i wouldn't have to drive all the way into edmond to enjoy a beer with my dinner.  i've visited this location 4 times since it has opened, and each time i have received very poor service. on my first visit, i ordered a beer, it was brought to me and as i was about half way through my drink when a server approached me, snatched my beer and said that it was intended for another table and walked off.  i was too shocked to react.  ace, the manager on duty came by.  i explained the strange behavior, he apologized and took corrective action.on my second visit, my wife and i sat at the bar.  we ordered our food and beer.  that was the last time the bartender acknowledged our existence.  we had to flag down another server to get an order or wedge fries, which never arrived.  i saw ace manager on duty, who had helped us on our first failed visit and explained to him that we were being totally ignored. he again apologized for his staff and corrected the server's mistakes.my third visit had better service, but the chicken tenders that i ordered looked and tasted like they came from the sam's club next door.on my fourth and final visit which was with my son last night.  we ordered wings and i ordered a beer.  midway through my meal, i ordered a second beer, which never arrived.  i explained to my server, julie (who was actually attentive) that i no longer wanted the beverage and wanted to tab out.  the manager on duty came by.  i shared with him my continued disappointment with service that i have received on all of my visits, including this one.  he gave me a very insincere apology and made not attempt or offer to make things right.i understand that there are growing pains with a new restaurant, but 4 times in a row is inexcusable. needless to say, it looks like i'll be going back to old chicago and brick town brewery.  i will say that that interior is very cool, tons of monitors for watching sports and very contemporary.  what a missed opportunity."
is there less then one star? i mean what in the blank beep beep... come the fuck on... stop talking to each other and watching the game please pay attention to tour guests.. heck they may be hungry or sitting here with an empty cup for 13.34 minutes... yes i timed it... i am an engineer so yes i can tell time... great store lots of tvs and games you want but bar waitstaff blows
"update****went in tonight and mod had comp my meal because of the mistake from last time but preston had gone above and also comp my son's meal. everything came out correct and i made sure to tip the waitress before all the discounts. thank you. everyone left happy. i made a takeout order and went to pick it up. the guy at the front, i think his name was chris or preston, not sure but he seemed to be the mod at the time told me that they had to remake my order because they had messed it up. i was like it's ok. no problem, i'll wait. ended up waiting almost 15 mins so i told of 50 mins since i made the order... anyways i got my food. went home and it was still the wrong order. different rub from what i had ordered. called back and he asked if i wanted to come back for a new order. no, not really. at this point you guys will be close in 30mins. so he said he left a note and i can come back whenever for it so  i will just order ahead tomorrow or somethingso we'll see what happens then."
service is just flat out bad. been here several times for nfl games and i am done. hostess need a lot of training too.
"my wife and i frequent this bww so often that we get our to go orders picked up and carried to us as we walk in the door. we most recently went yesterday on cheap wing night (60 cents per boneless wing!)let me break the classic honey bbq wing experience for you. the first biteas the flavor of both sweetness and bold bbq chicken flavor immediately begin bathing your taste buds in food gold. the slight crunch from the fried breading lets you know that this is no normal experience....this is home. you have finally found the true meaning of home.mid way pointyou now have scarfed down a bare minimum of 8 wings and start to think that maybe your mortgage payment that comes out tomorrow isn't actually the most important thing to spend money on. you wonder if it is time to order an entire extra platter of wings or if you can fight off the uncontrollable urges to keep this immense high going.the final wingyou look down at the remains of what can only be described as a plate in the final stages of a 1,000 year war and realize there is only one wing left. your eyes begin to water from overwhelming sadness that no matter how happy you are, sometimes you have to experience sadness so you can appreciate the happy times more. your stomach celebrates that it can finally relax from the non stop multi marathon that was the ""wingamania"" you just brought down on it. you slowly savor every last bit of that final perfection of chicken and set your weapons down at your side. it...is...donemy wife had the specialty wings ""crimson crush""they were okay"
"i live literally less than 5 min from this place and choose to go to a different location. the last 2 times i had a to go order i waited nearly 30 min insides the location. on top of the extra 20min i spend waiting at home to ""assume"" that my order is ready. no kind of customer service at all. i am giving this 2 stars only because the blue dressing is good."
i ate here a while back and the food was so ridiculously salty it was inedible. i told the waitress and sent back both dishes and the manager came to apologize and we were given new meals (had to re order something different)  was told the sauce was made incorrectly and it all had too much salt. you'd think they wouldn't serve it to people.... ive been to other bww locations and this one has a weird vibe and isn't free standing. not the type of place you want to go have a beer and watch some football or soccer.
"b dubs was off. wings were cold, monster cuban sandwich was too charred and salty and fries came with wrong order. dirty silverware and slow service.   we ate. we tipped. we won't be back."
"updated review.  placed a call in order.  walked in and the african american kids were just leaning on the hostess stand.  had to tell them i had a to go order.  once i got to the counter the ""got my name wrong"".  i don't know hard it is to get the name ""ben"" wrong.  then they don't have heating lamps for the food and didn't offer me the drink for the kids meal.  i'll never be back. i've tried this place time and time again but this is the tip off.  i tipped the girl two dollars because she had to grab the managers arm from flirting with the two girls he was talking too so that he could help her.  get you act together buffalo wild wings."
the service was great and the food was great my sever was great to so yes i would go there again to eat as my family
"stay far away from this place. it's dark and dirty. service is terrible, management is unprofessional. food was awful, due to sitting under burners for far to long, due to terrible service, due to poor management! will not return."
"corey was our server when we stopped in for a pre-game snack. as always, the soft pretzels were wonderful. we tried something new this time---buffalo loaded tots---and we have added them to our favorites list!"
"the food itself is great. mild wings are my favorite and probably the only flavor aside from ""asian zing"" that i can tolerate without my mouth burning up. however, i do feel their customer service could use adjustments. every time my boyfriend and i go in here, the waitresses are constantly smiling at him or giving him flirty looks. rude and very much annoying.  they were not attentive to our needs but didn't mind attempting to hit on my boyfriend. also, the fries we've ordered were cold on both occasions. i do feel they're over priced for what you get, but that's my personal opinion. love their wings, just wish the service was better."
"came in here after a swim meet and honestly we've had mediocre wings and some terrible service with super long wait times at this franchise and even this same location.  my son loves wings though so we stopped. i made a point to order as soon as we sat down and even my son, five minutes later, couldn't believe it when our wings came out piping hot, extra crispy, and cooked exactly the way we like, bone in naked with sauces on the side plus fries.  the meal rocked, the service rocked, we were happy for a change. i think the key was we were in between lunch and dinner a bit at 130. we were happy and as long as it's not peak times we will be back again. don't go at their busiest times and i think you'll love it too. i usually cook wings from scratch with a bake recipe that i've perfected over the years that are extra crispy at home for about half the price they charge. 30 bone in wings, fries for four, ice water, for $40. not cheap, we don't go often."
my family and i came came here to visit tonight. extremely poor customer. we waiting extremely long for our drinks and then even linger for our wings. i love buffalo wild wings but i will not be visiting this particular location again.
"don't waste your time. service was slow and food was underwhelming. they didn't have two beers listed on the menu. the waitress was very nice and tried very hard, but there was just to much to overcome."
well i'm not happy with the store! they mess my order all the way up! my food was cold! y'all know how it is to have ice cold fries!
"this buffalo wild wings has below mediocre wings and foods. there are other locations in oklahoma city better than this one. it took us almost an hour to get our foods. the restaurant was not busy and we never received an explanation on what's going on with our foods. communication would be very nice. service is terrible each time i come. maybe i'm biased, but the foods here always tastes below bww standards. i enjoy bww's cake, but not at all from this location."
"great atmosphere and food.  i ordered the traditional wings with 911 sauce extra wet.  food came out just the way i wanted and the service was great.  if you want to smoke, the bar is separated by a glass partition to keep the air clean for the people sitting in the main dining area.  apparently, and i didn't know this, it is the b dubs policy to keep all the tvs in the bar on the local team channels when they play.  so, if your a thunder which is great, but you want to watch another game, you will be out of luck unless you go ask the other customers if you can switch one of the tvs to another game.  still, i love the thunder and the wings so it's still a win-win situation."
"i mean... it's a buffalo wild wings. pretty standard as far as a b-dubs goes. but, i do have a warning: don't go in the bar! it's disgusting in there! so smoke filled with minimal ventilation that i'm pretty sure i'd get sick just from being in the room! i feel bad for the workers that have to serve in there, i'd absolutely refuse to. i did feel pretty sick after my latest visit, maybe the lack of ventilation seeped through to the main dining area. possible... because i've never felt sick from their boneless wings, which were delicious btw. bourbon honey bbq - yummerz!service was good! food was good. prices are fair. just hate that the bar area is basically off limits unless your up for being hot-boxed by cigarette smoke."
"it smells like old people and feet in here reminds me when i go to ihop or jimmys eggs, bad service asked for a ranch and they never brought it forcing me to get up and go ask for it at the counter. not a very clean place . they don't even clean under the tables very good because i still see crayons under the tables."
"soooo i gave it some stars because i actually do like the wings - which is the only thing i get. however, the service at this location is consistently pretty terrible, and it takes forever for the food to come out. the new location off i-35 has a better atmosphere and much better service....super disappointing."
this is the nearest bww to me and i'm so glad because the food and service are both great! it doesn't help that it's right next to my gym though
"good to see a bww right in the middle of yukon. i've been to this location a few times now and have been fairly satisfied. i normally only come on tuesdays and thursdays because beyond that, you'll find yourself paying ridiculous prices for subpar food. nothing else on the menu fills me up except for all the wings i usually get on a tuesday or thursday. i've had their burgers (eh), nachos and salsa (gross), wraps (good but tiny and expensive), tacos, (eh but expensive), etc. you get the point. if you come here, you come for the discounted wings. this location has been pretty good when i've visited late nights but the first time i came, it took 40 minutes on a slow night for my 3 friends and i to get food. the 2nd time i was here was definitely better although they always forget to bring something, or mess up an order. i don't mind it very much since waiting tables can be hectic sometimes but keep in mind, it happens frequently when the staff member has to remember who got what from all the assortments of wings. two other things worth mentioning is that sometimes the wings have plenty of sauce or rub, and sometimes they don't have nearly enough. they also seem to randomly charge for ranch and bleu cheese. you either get lucky and get it for free, or you're charged a dollar something. overall, decent experience and i'll be back for another late night in the future since everything else is closed by then."
"if you're trying to wait an hour or more for you're food then this is the place. didn't like the service at all, would rather drive farther then to come here again."
"the service was horrible. we had to refill our own waters. we were never asked if we wanted beer refills. we had to get our own silverware. there were only two other tables and plenty of wait staff. finally, the credit card receipts came without any pen to sign them. i'm actually surprised i wasn't asked to cook the chicken."
"i love buffalo wild wings! tonight, my go-to boneless wings in asian zing have yet again failed to disappoint! my wings were doused in yummy sauce - not a dry spot on them! my wife ordered the buffalo chicken salad, and was a little bummed about the chicken being mostly breading and the over-abundance of croutons. the restaurant was well kept and managers were sure to come by and ask how our experience was. service from our waitress was quite sparse; she spent quite a bit of time at a few select tables, but it was pretty busy tonight. overall, we had a good experience and will definitely be returning!"
"got late night wings and cheese sticks, quick, hot, and tasty with great service. thanks!"
"right off the bat, we were seated at a dirty table. nice. we asked to be moved, and we were... to a table with crap all underneath it. but, hey. at least the table top was sorta clean'ish.we ordered our drinks: dr pepper for the wife; water and a tall blue moon for me. i don't drink often, but work is dragging me down, and... you don't want to know any of this. moving on. our drinks were delivered quickly. so we ordered. she got chips & queso and original wings - honey bbq. i ordered boneless, half caribbean jerk and half bourbon honey mustard or something. i also ordered buffalo chips. her queso stuff came out really quickly. now i'm not a cheese, or queso, eater so it looked completely nasty to me. it was yellow cheese sauce with something just thrown down the middle. she ate most of it. i didn't bother to ask if it was any good because i can't imagine that it was. ewww.our wings came out shortly. i liked mine, even the honey mustard ones. i really liked the 4 cups of ranch, too! the buffalo chips were good. they had a good crisp on them, but were soft inside. we had to bring the majority of our wings home, (we got the smalls, too)! it was a decent experience. food was good, just the cleanliness kinda grossed us out."
"we had been out chasing storms trying to get a shot of some clouds and a lightning shot so we were wet and muddy and didn't want to go through some cheap place to eat so i was glad that bww is open late. surprisingly, i've never eaten here before.the pretzels were good. the queso cheese was good enough that i could eat it like a soup, but it was a weird combination with the pretzels. i was shocked at how small the bacon cheeseburger was. for $10.50 it should be bigger than a mcdonald's cheeseburger. the meat itself wasn't that great. you could tell it was a low quality frozen meat patty that lacked any type of seasoning. the fries were good enough to throw out for the birds or any other animal that might pass by.the teriyaki wings and sweet bbq wings were delicious but they forgot the ranch dressing with the carrots. that's when we realized the mini corn dogs were missing. we ate the cheesecake bites which were really good, and the chocolate cake. the cake was a little dry and although the icing was nothing special except there was a few different types of chocolate, it satisfied my craving for chocolate.we called back and told them about the missing corn dogs and drove right back to get them. they were lukewarm at best and they forgot the bourbon mustard sauce but we didn't feel like going back in for the third time. i still prefer a&w's corn dog nuggets, and they are much less expensive than bww.i might go back on a tuesday for some wings and maybe some pretzels but i haven't completely decided on that yet.moral of the story.. don't go t a wing place and expect their burgers to be any good."
"this review is based on a number of visits dining in the bar area. if you enjoy smelling of smoke and bar staff more interested in their phones than in cleaning previous guests' plates and glasses, you'll feel right at home here. i hope the new hooters runs circles around these guys."
"went in at 4pm on monday with my 2 kids 6 & 8 and ordered soon as we sat and at 4:30 our sever came by to tell us that they just dropped the wings in the fryer, what?  i said we will just cancel our order, we were 1 of two tables in the whole place and they could get an order of wings done inside 30 minutes?  second time this has happened to us at the yukon location."
very disappointed.. it's christmas. i'm in town for 2 days to visit my husband. the wait is long understandable since it's christmas. but we waited for our food for 2 hrs before we just decided to leave so we didn't waste anymore of christmas.  we were told it'd be about 45 min which is long but understandable but cmon almost 2 hrs for food???  buffalo wild wings wasted so much of our time this christmas. total fail.
"the food was good. our waitress was a sweet and helpful.  but we ordered appetizers, and didn't get them till we got all are food.   the manager came by and apologized for the mess up, and gave us a credit on are bill.  which was very nice. we will be back."
"came in, place was empty, baseball was on, which was good. got the chubby waitress (of course, just my luck) and she got my friend's order wrong. had a guinness on tap which was great too. my friend doesn't like to make waves so he ate the wrong order she brought him, but it wasn't very good and now he won't go back with me. his fault i guess for not sending it back. two meals and single beer was 40 dollars somehow. ok i guess. underwhelming service overall."
"let me start this review by saying that i love boneless wings. it's very rare that i come across a wing that i don't like. (yes, i'm aware that they're glorified chicken nuggets dipped in sauce. no, i don't care.) however, i've been to this location several times and every time i order wings, they never taste like they're fresh. because i really like bww as a chain, i've been willing to give this location multiple chances. it's almost as if they've been sitting under a heat lamp after being made during the opening shift. they don't skimp out on sauce, so i must give them credit for that. the drinks are a little overpriced and are possibly watered down, but i suppose that's what i get for ordering a cocktail at a sports bar. in conclusion, wingstop is worth the drive if you want fresh wings."
this place is the absolute worst when it comes to the waitstaff. they are extremely slow and seem to not care about taking care of their customers. we waited thirty minutes before our order was taken on a not so busy day and this is not the first or second time this has happened.
"good beer, like the wings but the service is horrible.   corporate may want to spend some time here."
had the most digesting naked tenders here. cold and slimy and didn't taste grilled. i've had them before at other locations and they were really good.. don't know what went wrong. also asked for wedges and they brought me regular fries and said they were out of wedges. so i got nothing i went there to have. :'(
people are always nice and they get you taken care of pretty quickly!
"it's like your typical bww, but has a pretty good staff. good food, cold beers, and good staff."
"exactly what i went in for, wings and beer. conversation with the waitress was good. acted like she cared about her job. that is tough to find these days."
"i've never had a bad experience in the four times i've eaten at this new location. they might be a little slow, but it's worth it for good food."
"this place gets a 5 star rating due to the very nice layout, seating in main area, however i was more impressed with bar area and patio area. me and wife don't smoke and it wasn't smoky as most buffalo wild wings around the area, had great ventilation to combat the smoke from others, so many tv's with a 10ft projection on bar, you can't miss a game or your favorite sports in here. food is 3 star, service was okay, could've been quicker but giving the circumstances that this place just opened, it will get better. service was friendly but again seemed overwhelmed due to a lot patrons but overall i would recommend.nachos suck so be forewarned."
"lol. i'm actually too tired to be frustrated with this particular location... but this was my first and will be my last time at this location. the service is terrible. we (the boyfriend and i) weren't acknowledged for 15-20 minutes and we ended up leaving the restaurant. we don't feel bad for walking out, because none of the staff really noticed us. our table is still clean and they never asked for our drink orders. three servers in our section obviously didn't notice us and they walked by us several times. honestly, i'm not the type of person to flag down a server... so there's that. also, the place just looked like a huge mess. there were so many customers that needed their drinks refilled, but that's none of my business."
"this bw3 simply lacks customer service and has zero ability to be able to even meet the needs of any consumer. they were out of the korean bbq sauce, ok, can you mix two sixes together etc. no, our cook doesn't want to have to clean two bowls. ok...."
"we came in on a thursday evening at around 520. it was really, really busy. the place is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. they have so many t.v.s that it takes a minute to look at all of them. literally, there's not a one foot space on the wall that is not touching a tv somewhere. it's wall-to-wall tvs so if you want to watch the game or play trivia this is your place to go.  the food was pretty good. they have a few kinks to work out, but since they only opened a week ago, there is room for grace while they do so. the chicken in my buffalitos was dry, and i had to send the wedges back because they made them wrong at first, but it was quickly fixed. that's why the four stars, but i plan on coming back soon and anticipate adding that fifth star. my husband really enjoyed his meal and devoured it. i saw a few drinks i might want to come back and try on the lengthy drink menu. i am glad they are here and plan on being here often. i hope it stays nice and doesn't go the way of the bww in moore. that place... yikes!"
"i was a little taken back the last time we visited. when a male employee walked into the women's bathroom several times to check his hair. the first time when my daughter was in there. not sure what their restroom policy is, but i most defiantly was not comfortable with that. food also didn't come out the way i ordered it, but watching all the employees of the store, i wasn't going to send it back. don't think i will be visiting this location again and less i read that it has improved."
"i've been here on 4 separate occasions it is safe to say this place fucking blows. the first time i went the waitress fucked up my order 4 times i said you know what it's probably because it's a new location i'll try it again and let her have a pass. second time i go i sit at the bar. i order my drink a short lone star to be exact. i get my beer but for the next hour i am not checked on. it is as if it is my job to flag down the bartender rather the bartender check on me. the third time i went i asked if we could get a certain channel on one of the tv's (three of the tv's were showing women's sec gymnastics, no one was interested) not only did they say the could only change it if i knew the exact channelbut they also would not tell me what provider they had so i could give them the channel... the 4th and final time. the waitress would take forever in bringing us our drinks, she often times would go off and talk with other tables for 10-15 minutes after taking our order. she was not hot and i left a 4th time very disappointed. i think they'd hire a donkey to work in the bar at this point. it fucking sucks and the manager is a cuck."
"we went to the new buffalo wild wings on sw 104th and i-44 and had a great experience. the place was clean and the staff friendly, our server was awesome he didn't let our tea glass get under half."
"my daughter loves bww and typically drives to the nw expressway location. i suggested we try the newest one off i-44. they weren't busy in the main dining area. shortly after arriving we were seated and placed our order. i asked to have the lettuce, tomato & onion on the side for my burger. when the orders arrived the cook had swapped our orders but that's something we could easily adjust. however, the overall composition of my daughter's  buffalo burger wasn't as expected. the a/c kicked on..why? it's cool outside. although she was wearing a jacket, the blower cooled her off to the point of discomfort. the server was friendly but it appeared they're still working out the kinks (that's what i'll chalk it up to) as we weren't offered drink refills and it looked as if she was training another server. the table behind us had a server who stopped over 5 to 1. maybe it was the constant refills on alcohol. yah, we'll keep making the drive to the nw expressway location and give this location time to figure things out."
"i came here excited, but unfortunately i was let down like a dude leaving a strip club. i ordered the buffalo chicken ranch wrap and i know what you are saying """"tommy why wouldn't you just get wings ya whackamole!?"" well the answer is i'm adventurous. the tenders in the wrap had little to no sauce... sauceless almost i asked for no tomatoes it had had tomatoes. it was also luke warm. needless to say wing stop all the way."
"i love buffalo wild wings and have been eating at the various locations around okc and in other cities as well, however this location is sub part both in service and portioning. if you order a $10 salad it will be about the size of a $5 small side salad at any other restaurant and more than once they have forgot to put the wing flavor on the chicken on it, also if that salad is ordered to go they will put it in a cardboard box that the dressing will soak through. the orders of wedges generally come out about half full if that. lastly the service is simply awful, all of the employees are more concerned with talking to one another than taking care of the customers, on one occasion the only person to check and see if i needed more to drink was the manager right before i left (my cup had been empty for 10 minutes by that point). i have given this location 4 chances before i decided to write this and i am done with them, instead of driving the 5 minutes it takes me to get to this location i will drive the 25 minutes it takes me to get to either the moore location or the one off nw expressway."
"i opened this location (franchise/steve howard) after working 7 years at the grapevine, tx (mit corporate training store) as head bartender and manager trainer. this location is already violating corporate standard, u.s. labor work force and state/u.s. liquor laws. four days into operation and i'm contacting all of the above."
"i have never been waited so poorly before. i came in with my girlfriend on a friday night. everything was going well until the waiter gave us our food. first of all we did not specify that we wanted ranch, but we got some anyways. secondly, my girlfriend had requested bleu cheese which we did not get. finally when the waiter came back with our check i had seen that he had charged me for the ranch (which we did not ask for) plus we were charged for the bleu cheese that we never received. i don't know if the waiter was high or just very forgetful, but i will not be going back here if i am served by the same waiter again."
"i hate giving negative reviews, but this is just ridiculous to say the least. this location has been open for such a short period to be receiving such negative reviews. the food was horrible. my lemon pepper wings were so strong and over seasoned i could not eat more than one. my husbands wings were over sauced and soggy. the fries were soggy and greasy as well. my son said his burger was ""okay"" even though he ordered it plain, meat and bacon only. it came out with all the vegetables! we spoke with the manager and he was very nice about the situation except he was full of excuses. he actually said that if we come between 2 to 5 the food is better?? when really eats dinner at that time and why can't it be the same anytime of the day?? the waitress was sweet and as helpful as she could be. she was training another employee, but it's my opinion that she too was not properly trained. i won't be back."
"sareh was an awesome server!  she was extremely nice, attentive, and knowledgeable of the menu.  bww's has added a bunch of new items to their food menu, and several more beers on draft."
typical bww with slow service and mangers staring at people. when we sat they said ask about secrete menu. took waitress a while to remember to turn over her book and read the secrets. manager walked around asking if everything was good. never realizing the glasses were empty. wish we could get a corporate bww instead of these franchises.
"first time visiting..... if i would have been able to eat my food i would have given 5 stars. but it was kinda my fault. i ordered a burger with ""bacon jam"" on it and asked for no veggies esp onions! the waitstaff was very friendly and efficient and quick. we got fried pickles, they were okay a little sogggie but the sauce for those pickles was amazing! so i got my burger and there were onions everywhere! it was in the ""bacon jam"" i should have asked what ""bacon jam"" was and i didn't and when i said no onions they should have mentioned it or left it off. i tried to scrap it off but in doing so all the cheese came off and it really just wasn't ediable after.... so i decided not to eat it. my waitress noticed immediately and offered to recook it or get me something else, i declined. then the manager came over and again offered to remake it or get me something else. i declined and then a little later a different manager noticed i wasn't eating and again asked to fix it which i declined. it was my fault kinda. but other then that everything was great! and i was surprised at how the staff noticed i was not eating and tried everything to fix it and then even though i asked them not to they insisted on taking it off the ticket! we will eat here again . i don't know that i have ever had staff handle an issue with my food so well! if they would have mentioned the onions in the jam or left it off i would have given 5 stars! :-)"
the food is terrible! i got their mild wings and they came out cold and soggy. my girlfriend got chicken tenders they were cold and the meat was very poor quality. it had tendons in it.
"how hard is it to run a wild wings, really? we arrived at 5 on a monday and there were only two other tables at the time. staff all over the place but nobody actually doing anything. nobody was there to greet us or seat us. our server forgot that we'd asked for a tablet, took forever to bring a bottled milk and didn't bring out the appropriate sauce with our appetizer. the food tasted like it always does, and i like wings, but this place is just poorly managed and sad. no employee pride in the operation or sense of urgency, and that was with no customers. i'd hate to see it when it's busy. yikes. probably will go next door to ted's next time."
everyone here today is pissed between wrong orders and it taking 45 minutes or longer to get served is a bit much. i have never had such a poor experience with bw's ever. this one will not get my business or company business again. this post was placed on 6/29 and not one person from bw reached out so guess who is concerned with reputation management? not this location for sure!!!!
this place put me and my friend in a closed section for about 2-3 hours would've been longer had i not spoke up then laughed about it. they also gave my order to someone else when i ordered through postmates. when i called mad they were going to double charge my card. avoid it like the plague.
"there's some bad reviews for this place, but i've been here a lot. i'm probably considered a regular in the bar side. i either sit at the bar, or close to it. i've very rarely had a problem here. the bar service is quick and they're all nice, the food comes out quick and is good. the wings always have a lot of sauce, which has been a complaint of mine in the past, that they were too dry. the bar side is kinda smoky but it's not bad, just one of those oklahoma things i guess, being allowed to still smoke in some places. i was served yesterday by a girl named gabriella i think, she was wonderful! i hope she or the manager sees this."
"i love the atmosphere! great view on all games. i've been here many times and i almost always am very disappointed in the food. tonight, half my shrimp was burnt. last time my burger sucked. they see the food is not correct but bring it to you anyway. on a brighter note kat is fantastic! she is the bartender. always a pleasure to be around. i only come to this location for her."
"ok ok ok, we can look at this turd from the outside & know this isnt a premier bww. anyone over the age of 15 realize when its a chain restaurant l, its either hit or miss and this bwws is a miss. i mean, even the parking lot suggest that much thought wasnt invested into this location. call in your order either tuesday or thursday and get your food to go unless you're sitting at the bar. deadpool out."
"this gets a 4 not because the experience was in any way negative, but they're a chain, and if you know me, that's just not my jam. the service was excellent, the food was quiite god, and i was a lovely way to catch up with long-missed ""relatives"" by marriage, even thought it was a sad occasion.the place is always clean, the food is delicious - i love the simplicity of the menu, and the service was absolutely a+++++, especially with a loud, boisterous group of eatons.overall, lovely but definitely not the absolute best, life-changing experience. however, consistency and decent food count for a lot - especially after a long day of funeral arrangements and in my case, being on a plane!"
"awful! we go to the bww on nw expressway all the time and decided to unwind after soonercon at this location. we were a large party of people and they stood to make good tips and a significant amount on orders from us had they not been so incredibly awful. to start, we get there and the restaurant area is practically empty but most of the tables are covered in dirty dishes and trash. none of these tables were cleaned until we left two hours later (yes, two hours... i'll get to that).so we put in our drink orders after a significant wait and some put in food orders as well. we receive our drinks in a fairly timely fashion. then everyone puts in food orders. it was 40 minutes before receiving any food at all... during which time wait staff never stopped by to check on our drinks or ask if we'd like any more beers/liquor. people from our table were getting up and going to the fountain by themselves to refill sodas. finally our food starts coming in. well, for the most. one person didn't get their food order at all and another person only received half their order. we had to track them down to make this clear and they acted put out. they didn't distribute napkins so one of our people had to find some. the people who ordered burgers and chicken sandwiches said theirs were tough, burned and flavorless. our waitress was sullen and nearly silent all night. her face made it clear she didn't care about this job and if anything felt we were ruining her night. she didn't apologize once. the manager was there too, she was the one who finally cleaned up the tables. then we have to track them down to get to-go boxes and checks. it's now 2 am and we're all exhausted from a long day of con. i get two checks for my order and one of them also includes extra wings that we did not order. i now have to go up front and work this out, all while the waitress is giving me a death stare in total silence. then she screws it up again and needs the manager to fix it.we had hoped for some quick and delicious fried food and beer after a long day. we got instead total misery. do not go to this location! if you're craving b-dubs it is literally worth driving to any other location. bww isn't known for the best service but my god this is the worst service i've ever received anywhere."
"the worst buffalo i've ever been to. have worked at buffalo for over 5 years in another city, this is by far the worst store i've ever seen. don't waste your time coming here. food came out sub par, could obviously tell it sat in the window. management was rude and didn't even know how they're own reward system worked. awful location. if i could leave 0 stars i would."
"i always go to this buffalo wild wings, usually the service is good but in this particular trip it was such a mess. tables and booths still had other people's trash and they sat us wherever it was free. tables next to up built up with such a mess. our waiter, she did not bother to tell us her name, took 20 minutes to even take our order and we were the only customers besides another family. she took our order down wrong and forgot our fries. we couldn't enjoy our dinner because kids were running around and the manager did not even try to ask them if they can keep their kids in the area. i don't see why they couldn't clean up the place if they didn't have customers. they were walking and talking with each other during our whole visit."
"we came to this restaurant for a normal dinner.  i just got the overall feeling that the food was somewhat overpriced and not a good value for my money.  therefore i skipped getting ""wings"" and went with their burger menu items.  i just wasn't to impressed with the burger flavor wise and the fact that it fell apart.  the onion rings were soggy and i could not eat them.  my impression is that it's best to come here and utilize any specials they may be offering."
"the food is really good, i am giving it two stars for a few other reasons. the building at night is straight dark no exterior lighting you can't tell if it's open or closed. and if you park in the back closer to the freeway it's a little unsafe because it's so dark in that area of the property. i don't believe lighting will save you in a life threatening situation but at least someone can see what's going on. the customer service is pretty dry not the best at all."
"good ol' b-dubs! love the asian zing, and always get the honey bbq wings and a set-up of chips and chunky salsa. came to this location for the tuesday night traditional wing special (.69 cents ea). tons of tv's with all the trending sports. tall beers and cold cocktails available on request. this visit was on a rainy night around 6:30pm with no significant sporting event in que. service was perfectly fine. food tasted great."
this was the worst bww we have ever been to. when we walked in to be seated the hostess and our waitress discussed openly in front of us how she did not want to serve us. i almost left but we were starving so i didn't say anything. the waitress took out order but it took three times before she got it because she would just walk away in the middle of it. i asked for straws and she rolled her eyes at us and threw her hands to her side. we were very nice to her and tried to kill her with kindness and it did not work. the wings were hotter than we ordered and they were chewy. to top of this horrible experience someone had vomited outside the front door. it was disgusting.
"i usually like bdub, but this is by far, my worst experience at one! the bar was crawling with sketchy customers loudly yelling obscenities to the point where it was impossible to hear.  also, there were an inordinate number of smokers in the bar area to the point that my clothes & hair stunk really bad when i left.    gross side of town, i guess attracts gross customers!"
"maybe i'm just outgrowing this food, but it was pretty bad.our server was great, but this other server literally walked up to our table and stood adjacent to us (like where our server would stand) to watch tv. after a few moments, she realized she was being super unprofessional and left, but still... i get that it's also a bar, but that's why there's a super deliberate divider between the bar area and the family area.anyway, the sauce is overpowering. the fried mushrooms taste like 90% batter and 10% mushrooms.i used to love this stuff as a college kid, but either the quality has gone down or i have grown up."
"went in for lunch--admittedly with a large group. took about 25 minutes to get drinks and order (one person in my party was completely skipped over for drinks--a random manager happened to see & get him water). order was put in, around 15 mins later the food starts coming out. now, mind you, 2 other parties of 8 or more were seated, ordered, and had food by this point. my order comes out--and it's incorrect. waitress tells me, ""oh, everyone else got the lunch portion, i assumed you did too."" so she assumed my order (as well as the side option).we ask the manager if we will be getting it free, since we had been waiting forever. manager says no, the time stamp shows it took less than 15 minutes. way to work the system, bww. i'm still waiting for the waitress to come take my bill. total lunch so far has been 1.5 hours. the wait continues!update. just left. waitress never even came back to take my money. i was sitting at the table, last one there. other people had gone up to other wait staff to pay.eta (in case you think my ""free"" comment wasn't classy... ir.buffalowildwings.com/…;)"
"i hate this location. the entire staff with the exception of management is made up of high schoolers and rotates constantly. untrained, gossipy, aloof children fill the place. our food took 30 minutes only after we waited 15 minutes before we could flag someone down to take our order. the last time i came here we ordered to go and it came faster than this time. also the table was sticky and had food and trash on the floor under and surrounding it because the hostess was rushing to seat us. i didn't even want to put my feet under the table it was so nasty. i will not be returning."
"i came here with my family after watching fireworks at the fourth fest downtown. we were immediately seated. we ordered our food and it arrived in a fair amount of time. i loved that they had these little hand control game pads for the kids. we had our nephew and niece with us as well so having 5 kids in one table, all under the age of 12 was a hand full. the controllers kept them busy and our table quiet. i felt our server was overworked and was running around like a chicken with its head cut off . i dont blame her if we did't really get out cups filled and things brought fast enough because i think the management had her catering to too many tables. thats why i dropped it a star. also because the wings were good but not great. it's still one of my favorite places. i just think because they brought us around 75 wings, it was not as good. some wings didn't even have sauce on it. it should have been coated better. it doesn't happen often cause ive been here lots of times but i think they should probably pay attention to not doing that in the kitchen. other than that this place is great. i love the big screen tv's & the sporty vibe. i have come here for a long time and will continue to come for a long time because it does what its suppose to and 9/10 times they do it right."
waited 20 minutes of wings. at 2 pm on monday. c'mon. wings only take 3_4 minutes in the friers. i can see why this place has these reviews.
"my best friends wife waited an hour for her food, which wasn't even the same thing. she ordered the cuban sandwich and received nachos. what. i am a waiter at one of the busiest restaurants in oklahoma, and i can say this, our waiter luna was not trained. was she nice? sort of. i have been where she had been when it comes to crappy customers but dam. the company needs to train their servers better at the okc establishment. my waitress name is luna. train her bww. it's not her fault but jesus get a manager to help you or something"
"it was decent for a saturday afternoon. our waitress, sabrina was exceptional. food came out hot."
"horrible service. the manager literally could not care less about his staff or the fact the restaurant is filthy. bathrooms were dirty and smelled awful, the floor was covered in food particles and trash. it took over 30 min for our food to come out and my chicken was cold and under cooked."
"this place has gone down hill. not bww in general but this store in particular. i go in for a take out. and the two managers are just standing there. i am at the counter. after about 5 minutes of me standing at the counter to place my order and no one acknowledging me i say something to the manager behind the counter. he says ""she will have to take your order"" and walks away. so i take my order. the girl was obviously new and was having trouble but the manager just walked away and let her do it on her own. the menus were disgusting. the bathrooms were gross. and my guess would be the tables were dirty too because two different people came up to the hostess and asked them if they could come over and clean the table. the funniest part of the whole thing is both managers just stood around. was doing nothing. the take out area was getting 10 people deep and they didn't come over to help. they were 5 feet away. standing there watching monster trucks on tv and saw the crowd at the take out counter and did nothing. these two managers are terrible. just terrible. and the wings which are usually ok. today from this store, very below average."
"i have been to bww several times during the weekend and have found that service and cleanliness was lacking; but not at this location. this location is close to the outlet mall and i thought that for sure we would have a long wait time. well, i was pleasantly surprised. we walked in and there were premade bww crowns all set up. we put out name on the list and my husband came in from parking the car then, boom it was our turn. we had a seat and about 2 minutes later our server (heather) came to our table to take our drinks. she asked wether the kids could have a tablet to play on while they waited then brought them right away. we ordered a fairly large order of wings and chicken strips for the family and we waited a while, but when the server came with the food it was fresh and she had plenty of napkins and extra bone trays. she came by and refilled drinks and checked on us on multiple occasions. i have to say that i have never had an experience like this at bww. the food was served hot and the service was great. i don't know what this manager is doing different, but her/his efforts really showed in both the attitudes of the employees and the cleanliness of the restaurant."
"my friend and i have eaten here several times in the past and have never had a problem.  so tonight, there was a problem.   our server sydney was awesome and helped us resolve the problem with the help of john the gm.  we appreciate that very much and will definitely return."
"was seated right away, but waited 15 minutes before getting a server. i finally had to get the manager to get something to drink. a server finally took my order.i was a lead waiter at a restaurant in a busy california city, and i could handle the amount of customers here right now... by myself. there's at least 10 servers in here right now and every one of them ignored me. wthi'm here because of work, and i am not impressed at all with okc... too many unhappy people here."
traveling from california to arkansas we decided to get a hotel and across the street was this restaurant. although we have a restaurant in our town we have never been there. as we walk into this restaurant we were seated without a smile we received a hostess heather without a smile. after ordering are food a manager name selena stop by to ask us how we were doing i found that pleasantly nice. as we wait for our food to arrive after ordering i noticed selena bussing tables and taking care of restocking. i have to give the manager selena an atta-boy for the extra effort of bussing tables and restocking while her staff takes care of customers. the food was excellent and we will definitely try another buffalo wild wings buffalo wild wings in our area. as far as this location heather our waitress pulled her stretchy pants up while standing at the table talking to us we found that very inappropriate. i don't know if that is a corporate decision to have your waitresses wear stretchy pants but i would say change that policy. what's wrong with black slacks? i would like to leave a helpful hint do not cook your dessert cheesecake bites in the same grease you cook your chicken.... you can tell!!
"food: 1/5service: 2/5cleanliness: 1/5decor & style: 2/5i use to go here a lot only because it was near my old apartment and friends typically wanted to meet here for cheap wings night. it use to be descent, however, has gone down hill yearly.lets start with the food. the wings do not taste nearly as good as it did many years ago. sure, the sauce selection they have is great, but has anyone noticed the poor quality of the chicken? its dry and not tender at all. even the burritos and tacos has poor flavor, and the caesar salad is bland. service: they are typically slow. when you walk in there is no host there and you wait or ask for someone (unless it's dinner time).cleanliness: the ground looks dirty, and each time i come here the whole place smells like wet mop! no joke. i've been here plenty of times (didn't have a choice) and each time it smells like a wet mop, especially the entrance.decor: pretty cool place because of the large tv selection. otherwise boring, out of date looking.please trust my review, if you look at my other reviews 90% of the time i give a 4 or 5 star rating."
"met up with a friend to have some wangs. we walked in the door, and it took a good couple of minutes before anyone came to seat us. let this be known: we were there before 5 on a wednesday. and they were not busy.finally get seated. a young lady comes to get our drink orders after a few minutes. we had a dp, a tea, and a beer. it took longer than seemed necessary to bring our drinks, but okay...she took our appetizer order of fried pickles and stated she'd be back to get our dinner order. she came back when the pickles were ready and took our orders. my tea already needed to be refilled but i guess that wasn't a priority.she brought our entrees out, and noticed my glass then. she said it was hard to see because it was dark in our booth. uh, isn't that why you walk around to check on your patrons?? i thought that was restaurant 101? anywho.our food was bww quality. neither great nor terrible. just meh. about halfway finished with dinner, one of us needed another drink. do you think she noticed? no. she did not. that's pretty annoying, tbh. she did bring us our checks soon after that, to which we stated we wanted refills, plus our friend wanted another beer and we decided we wanted one too. she asked my partner what one she wanted but didn't ask me. guess i look pregnant or something? maybe i look like someone who doesn't need a drink? in any case, i didn't get one as she was quick to bring the new and revised checks with the beers.we didn't see her again for about fifteen minutes. by this time i was eating the ice out of my tea glass. she did not offer to refill it again. i was glad to leave when we finally did."
"the food was good, but our server was exceptional and the rating is more for her! ask for chelsea, she is absolutely darling! sorry if i spelt your name wrong!!!!! but i will ask for you every time, thanks for the warm welcome to the state and the spectacular service!"
i figured a chain of majors places would be able to maintain quality on staff and flavor.  the staff although nice they were not very attentive and the service was kind of mute for the place being half empty.  i guess they were tired from the lunch rush or something.our food took 35 minutes to come out wings burgers and a kids chicken tenders.  not a whole lot of fun with a 3 year old.  burger was bland and wings were just ok.
was verbally attacked by a staff member and when i brought it to the managers attention he offered no remedy.   the staff member was aggressive and used profanity and verbally assaulting my entire table asking us to leave when our food as just arrived after waiting 45 minutes for the food to come out.     we arrived at 1:11 and they took my order at 1:15 and food didn't come out to the table until 1:55 at 2:00 am he decided to be extremely rude telling us to get the fuck out of here and get your shit and leave etc.   he yelled this over the entire dining room.   and followed us out in the parking lot and continued the verbal assault .
service is fast and friendly sports on the tv and my beautiful lady. this place is always a winner
"we sat down and had a minor problem with getting the tv channel changed. as we tried to walk out one of the managers stopped us and made things right with my hubs so we sat back down. i'm glad we did because the boneless wings were delicious. very decent amount of food for the price, i always have to consider this because i eat with my hubs and 2 growing boys! we will definitely be back for sure."
"this place is ran by a bunch of idiots. i placed an online order, it said i could pick up my order in twenty minutes, went in twenty minutes later and they hadn't even started the order. i proceeded to wait another twenty five minutes to get the wrong order. i will never go back to this location and you shouldn't either!"
bad experience. waitress spilled water all over me. barely apologized and acted like nothing happened.  not coming back.
messy af took 30 mins to get appetizer asked for ranch and never got itbathrooms very grosscomped the first appetizer so 2 stars
"one of our favorite chain restaurants and so fun!  it's keto friendly, but worth cheating for sure.  ask for courtney who we met at the non-smoking bar."
"if i can give minus zero star, i will...i put an order at 9pm, to be pick up at 10.20pm, me and my boyfriend arrived at 10.10pm, they said it's not ready yet, well, we will wait for another 10 min, because it said 10.20pm, the order ready at 10.45pm, after couple of times asking what the name of the order was, not a single word of sorry..!!!!, i bet they forgot about our order, when we got home, the wings tastes like just come out of microwave, no blue cheese and ranch dressing for the carrot and celery, the worst part is not even a dipping sauce for cheesecake bites...they are the worst buffalo wild wings ever, just lucky no other bww near them... and they are lucky they have a big name of buffalo wild wings...make sure double check if you want to make to go order from this outlet...!!!!"
"tuesday night dinners are still a regular thing for us, and this bww is a favorite. however, our experience this time was less than pleasing.we sat in the newer part, the non-smoking bar area. rachel was our server, and things seemed to be going great until we ordered---or until after we ordered our entrees. we waited for over an hour on our food, which never came. when asked, rachel said that the power had gone off, and food was stacked up in the kitchen.  we watched others around us order, eat, and leave, so that reason was not well taken.we had to leave without eating. luckily, we had an appetizer earlier, so we weren't starving, but we had to find somewhere else to get dinner. as we left, we asked for a manager, who turned out to be joe. joe was less than bothered by our story. he only offered an apology. we will have to think about finding another bww location for the future."
first and last time here! for starters...tried to use their app. that was a joke. 5 mins fighting wirh it i gave up and call. signed up for there rewards but yet they couldn't find my account even though i got confirmation email back. they told me 20-30 mins. i got there and he said my order wasn't ready. after 45 mins he looks in the cabinet and there was my food. nice and cold. i got home open my boston hamburger to find it only had 4 mushrooms. stated eating it and it was raw. cheese cake cubes are fried crispy and the so call chocolate sauce was coco powder with milk. yuck!! stay away!!!
do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. if i had the time to tell you all the awful things i've seen i would. instead i'll tell you about the time i saw a literal cricket fall out of the ceiling and onto a booth. when i alerted our server she said it happened all the time. seriously? don't chance cricket legs in your wings and go somewhere else.
"before we had my son, my husband and i would frequent this place once a week.. i'm ashamed to say it but we did! we loved it! the service was never bad the food came out in a decent time great and the price and service was just right!i usually always got the chicken tender wrap because i'm not much of a wing fan... the wrap was great and came with your choice of a side which i always got chips and salsa.. the chips and salsa were so so.. cheese curds are amazing but not the healthiest by any means... but if you're wanting to grub out and not care order these they won't disappoint!my husband always gets spicy garlic and wild wings which are both pretty spicy... he enjoys them though.. thursday the boneless ones are on special also.this past time i got the chicken caesar salad i was so impressed! they hardly put any caesar dressing so tip if you get this order extra dressing.. most places just down the salad in dressing not this place which i enjoyed! it comes with some italian bread as well...drinks: my favorite is the cherry mojito so light and refreshing! the non alcoholic drink is called blueberry something which was great loved that when i was pregnant!"
i usually try to steer away from ordering here because something wrong always happens. well i accidentally placed a to go order online to this location and that was my bad but our pickup time was at 11:00 pm. my fiancé arrived around 10:50 and he has been waiting for a total of 40 mins and we placed the order at 10:00pm. another guy was there and he placed his order at 9:30 and was still waiting for his to go order. not sure why this place in particular sucks so bad but definitely double checking where i place my to go order next time because it's not worth it.
"this restaurant has really good wings, however today i messed up my to go order by not ordering extra crispy. this is not the anchor bar in buffalo(my favorite)new york, home of the original  buffalo wings, but these wings are pretty darn good. i enjoyed the traditional mild sauce on my wings. i also enjoy their cheese curd, bacon burger and  onion rings which are beer battered, and of course an ice cold beer. i've always had friendly service, the restaurant is clean with a nice sports atmosphere. on my takeout to order today, a very friendly wait staff opened each order and showing me exactly what i ordered, i appreciate this courtesy, there's nothing worse than getting takeout and having the wrong order."
this location has one of the worst customer service. expect to check your food yourself and not be acknowledged when you walk in.
"if you're not going to bww on thursday night boneless wing night then you're missing out. the wings are obviously their specialty but it's what you would expect the quality of food to be at a sports bar.on thursday nights they have a special on boneless wings that are .75 a piece as well as $1.50 domestic drafts on their 22 oz. glasses which is a complete steal. i get the boneless mild (it's so delicious) and sometimes their spinach artichoke dip. the staff is very friendly and work very hard. my best friend and i have been coming to this location almost every thursday for 2 years. the servers now greet us with our beers, which honestly, that type of customer service is the reason we continue to come back!"
"this is the worst customer service i have literally ever seen in my entire life. i called in a to-go order and spoke to a female, placed my order with her. she told me it would be ready in 30 minutes. i always allow for buffer time due to high volume during wing nights of course. i arrived at the 45 minute mark and paid with keonte (what her name tag read) and she then said nothing to me. i waited literally 15 minutes before she looked in the warmer where my food had been the entire time. had she even bothered to check  i wouldn't be bothered by the rude attitude. appalled."
"i've always loved bww and their amazing sauces, but i was pretty disappointed after ordering last night. it was our wedding anniversary so we decided to get some food to-go since we had originally met at bww ten years ago and it would be both sentimental to us as well as delicious. my husband ran inside to order while i waited in the car and it literally took over forty minutes to get our food. it was 9:13 when we pulled up and 9:55 when he finally arrived back at the car with our food. wasn't too happy about eating dinner at 10:00 at night, but in their defense it was a tuesday (wing night) and they were pretty busy. so we get home and we're opening our boxes and i had ordered a small boneless half honey bbq/half spicy garlic. well, they got my sauces correct but gave me traditional wings instead of boneless (i hate traditional wings btw) and on top of it, i only received 9 wings total instead of the usual 10-12 that i typically get when ordering a small. i received 4 honey bbq and 5 spicy garlic. i hadn't ordered a side to go with my wings because usually the boneless are so large and breaded that a small is enough to fill me up, but the traditional wings are honestly more bone than meat and the amount they gave definitely wasn't enough to fill me up by the end of it. my husband then started eating his food (a chicken tender wrap with honey bbq) and they had put caribbean jerk sauce on it instead of honey bbq! so both of our orders came out wrong. by this point it was around 10:30 and my husband offered to go back and have them correct our order, but it was already so late at night, we both had to work in the morning and i'm 8 months pregnant and hadn't eaten anything since lunch. so we just ate what we received and went to bed, me still being partially hungry. what was supposed to be a nice little dinner for our anniversary was ruined and i get that mistakes happen (i've worked in restaurants before) but the mistake falls on several people: the cooks for putting the wrong food in the boxes, the expo team for not verifying that the food was correct before bagging it, and the cashier for not checking the order before handing it to us. i feel like someone should have at least noticed that the wings weren't correct. it's also upsetting because we paid for boneless, which are more expensive than the traditional wings, and this was their wing discount day which made what i received even cheaper. so just disappointed all the way around."
"date: 02/23/17time: 10:24 pmdelivered by postmates (not on $3.99 delivery list)this will not reflect buffalo wild wing's customer service, cleanliness, or facility at all due to us not dining in or picking up at the facility. ordered: 1- hickory pulled pork sandwich (minus slaw and onions) with cheese curds1- cheesecake bites dessert with chocolate saucethe sandwich was on a hoagie roll with slightly dry pulled pork tossed in honey bbq sauce. the bread was soft and toasted, but there was something about the pork that tasted dry and kind of odd. it was okay, but not really reorder material. it may just be me, because it originally is supposed to come with slaw and onions, but since i'm not a fan... it was just meat and bun. nothing special. the cheese curds were good, but extremely greasy.  the cheesecake bites were really good! i would definitely recommend them!!! the chocolate sauce was just hershey's syrup poured into a container... again, not really special... but decent.it seems like everytime i go to buffalo, it's always pretty sub par... i would go if a friend chose it, but i can think of several other places i would rather dine at."
order to go was told to arrive at 2 waited an additional 30 minutes after i got here for my food.  also the food i did receive was room temp. definitely staying with wing stop or making wings at home going forward
"togo order was missing 2 items.  called to tell them and they were ""transferring"" me a manager but i was on hold for over 15 minutes.  i finally hung up.  worst customer service."
"massive failure of basic waiting etiquette. took nearly an hour to take my order, then when i got my food (spicy wings) left me hanging on my drink empty for 20 minutes."
it's 9:00 and they're running the vacuum cleaner while we're trying to watch football. very annoying noise and they could care less.
"not very happy with the service. walked in to find 3 young people standing at the booth socializing. 1 finally took the time to look over and i was greeted with a ""what's up"" and an awkward glance. i replied that i had 5 people in my party. he pauses, goes back to socializing, then looks over and says... i guess we'll have to clean up a table then. walks off. 7-8 minutes later comes back and looks so irritated. walks me to the table and begins tossing the menus on to the table. literally tossing them in random spots like it was some kind of irritating thing that me and my family came to eat there. i told him thank you. he turns away doesn't look at me and says yuup with an annoyed tone and hurried off. the restaurant wasn't busy at all. not sure why this young person decided to act so irritated and rude. had to really bite my tongue. no waitress for another solid 5 minutes at least. ordered 4 waters and a sweet tea. they came out almost 15 minutes later. the waitress was polite. but i sat with an empty drink once my food came out and it stayed that way. not good when eating hot wings. i won't be back to this location."
"solid sports bar. wide variety of menu items. good mixed drinks and beer selection at reasonable prices. lots of tv's that feature any sports related event needed. good for large groups and/or kids. i love the traditional wings with asian zing sauce and some ranch. snack size is a good deal for one person, but we order a large and get 4 sauces if we are sharing. i also love their chips and tomato garden style salsa (not spicy). this location has an indoor bar for smoking and a non-smoking open bar connected to the dining area."
"i just started going to this buffalo wild wings a week ago... the service here is exceptional. i have been ordering online, and the food is always hot when i arrive and makes work time lunch very convenient. there are little options in the area for quality food on short time in this area. this buffalo wild wings has never let me down. always exactly what i ordered and is ready when they state it will be. would greatly recommend this establishment to my family and colleagues."
