the bartender their donavan provides excellent service and knows all our preferences highly recommended
"this place is disgusting. we were seated immediately and waited 20 + minutes before leaving for someone to come to the table to take our drink order. i made the huge mistake of using the bathroom and in the small hallway before entering, there was an extremely strong smell of marijuana. servers were just walking around with nothing to do and somehow couldn't serve our table. this place needs to close down. note: this is a review for the one in sunset place."
"if you like your food being handled by potential drug dealers, then this is the place for you!after finishing watching a movie at sunset place, i was contemplating going to bww for wings with a few buddies, but after walking by the side entrance to the kitchen of bww, i see three employees in bww uniform smoking marijuana like nothing is going on.after confronting the three about it, they acted like nothing happened and quickly covered their faces in the shadows and went back inside. i asked the manager to deal with this situation, but the manager didn't resolve much besides sending them home only so they can come back to work again the next day! yes, the same employees still work here! the very least they could do is go do that at home and not in a family setting where families bring their kids. if i was a parent, i definitely wouldn't want someone high as a kite making my food and getting away with it.i'm not giving another dollar to this bww location until these three employees are fired or arrested. i won't be bringing colleagues, co-workers, family, or friends to this location anytime soon!"
"i've always loved buffalo wild wings, but the sunset location is not the place to go,especially on a weekday.  even though i was surrounded by empty tables, after being there for 5 mins without anyone approaching us, my date and i decided to leave."
"i'm a self-proclaimed chicken wing connoisseur and i take a special interest in seeing what new sauce, seasoning, or special rub restaurants have for wings. i must say that buffalo wild wings is one few places where i can find a pretty extensive selection of choices with great flavor. ranging from soothing sweet to blazing hot spicy you'll be sure to find your favorite type of sauce for wings. as you walk you'll notice the abundance of flatscreen tvs playing just about every sports game airing for that day/night. perfect spot to bring the friends for a sports night and some beers. on top of that have a perfect balance of appetizers, salads (for those of you who want to veg out), burgers , sandwiches & wraps , and desserts if you have a sweet tooth.all of my visits here i've been served hastily and the team members are all friendly and helpful."
"while the food here was really good, the wait for it did not make the trip worth while. it took more than fifteen minutes after we were seated for the waitress to show up. we tried to wave over several employees but they would look away as soon as we raised our hand. we nearly had to walk away. they weren't even busy, we went in on a thursday night. it also took forever to receive our food.. and it wasn't a difficult order, we all just wanted wings."
"this was my first time here and i really enjoyed their wings! i haven't had wings in a long time because i don't eat meat on a regular basis, and when i do, i want it to be good. we ordered forty wings for the table and four baskets of fries. we were hungry and were hoping to get in and out because we had to make it to the easter egg hunt on time.we didn't have to wait but a few minutes to be seated, the restaurant wasn't busy. we were a party of seven so they had to put some tables together to accommodate us. it's a very spacious restaurant, with many t.v. screens, and different seating options available. the staff was friendly and efficient. when we expressed our needs they were met right away. the chicken was tender and the flavors were very tasty. we ordered fifteen honey barbecue, ten garlic parmesan, and fifteen mild wings. it was enough to feed all of us with some left over. my favorite was the honey barbecue. our fries were delicious. everyone kept saying they tasted like if they were ""smoked"" fries. wouldn't that be interesting.overall, we had a great time and would visit again."
what a horrible service and also the front desk doesn't care at all don't recommend this place they are just chatting between them and they don't pay attention to the customers.
food is great. service is ok. all bww locations i have been to the food has been great. the service here could be better. i made an online order and came to pick it up. when i arrived they told me it wasn't made because i didn't call to confirm my order . . . ummmm. . . . that's why i made an online order-i didn't want to call. am i the only one that truly loves making online orders to sometimes avoid talking to people :) lol i didn't see the sense in having to call to confirm an order that was made and paid online. ugh-my payment is confirmation. it was just annoying. i had to wait for my whole order to be made after i arrived. this location has only paid parking so that was also very annoying as well. having to pay extra time on parking. eating in the restaurant service is better. i do not think i will be ordering take out from this restaurant in the future.
"i'm giving it three stars because the food is okay, not my favorite but they have options. i normally get their tacos and they're good. the service however is always terrible. i don't know if it's my luck here but the waiters or waitresses take very long to approach you. it took me 20 minutes to get someone to take my order.it tends to be like this all the time."
"one of my go-to spots for wings when in south miami. only down side is the long wait to see your server and get your food, since they are always full.. but i guess its because the wings are great and the beer is always nice and cold. nice place to watch a game.i'm a big fan of the lemon-pepper and parmesan-garlic wings with a basket of cheezy wedges."
"this place would be great if they understood customer service. i was warned before coming here that the service is horrible and service is just that absolutely horrible. i could understand if they were understaffed, but they are not. sad... wont be back!"
"terrible service. ordered ahead save time. i've been waiting for over 30 mins and the host kept telling me 5 for minutes for the past half hour. when i finally got the order, there were a lot of things missing. the dressings and the seasonings we paid for were missing. the wings are cold as well."
"what a terrible service, we stood there for 10mins wait then to decided which table to give us, and during the time, there's only few people. after seated, we waited so long to get menu, and 40mins later, we still didn't get chance to order, waste 40mins for a sip of water!!"
we came for dinner. the place was pretty empty around 6:30 but started to fill up a bit by the time we left. our waitress greeted us in a reasonable amount of time but took a while to get our waters. i asked about the ingredients on the kids menu because of our egg allergy. she left and i assumed she was asking the kitchen. she took a bit again and returned with the allergy menu. 2.5 stars are for the allergy menu. we ordered and our kids mac n cheese and bbq pork grilled cheese took forever. i wish i would have timed it so i could quantify for this review. my son did not like his mac n cheese so i asked for another cup of oranges. she gave them-.5 stars. my sandwich was pretty good but really greasy. i don't know if i can even complain about that given what i ordered-i mention so others are aware. i ate half. our plates weren't cleared until she dropped the check. won't go back.
"last time i came here with some friends about an hour before a movie, and we sat in the high tables near the bar and were waiting to get our order taken. the server never showed. we waited for roughly 50 minutes and nothing. we ended up just leaving because the movie was going to start soon. all we wanted to order was a few beers, we knew we couldn't order food because it would take too much time to prepare-but 50 minutes? i don't know how they could not have noticed the three of us.  the hostess had even seated us, it's not like we just walked in. it was crowded because it was a weekend. i've been here many times before this because i used to work in the mall, so in the past, the service was decent but nothing extraordinary. the vegan and vegetarian options were almost nonexistent. i ordered a salad, but they put so much dressing on it without me knowing and it was just completely saturated in salad dressing, and it was just gross. i felt bad, but i couldn't eat it. if you're not vegan/vegetarian, and you like wings, then you'd probably like this place. if you're into greasy food, go for it, because everything here is just so unhealthy. even the salads. it's like watching a cardiac arrest. the drinks are okay but they don't taste very strong. i'd prefer just going to the bar if i wanted to be served something better. it's also really sugary so watch out. they do have fun karaoke fridays, which is what i used to go to a lot with friends or coworkers when i was working in the mall. but for food and service, it is subpar and i would just recommend going somewhere else if you're aiming for less grease and more substantial food. overall it's a fun environment for groups, and karaoke night is great, but the food and service isn't really the best. it's usually hit or miss."
"worst service i've experienced at this place and it has gotten worse since the last time. just sat at the empty bar for 11 minutes in front of 3 bartenders, zero service or acknowledgement...got up and walked out."
"wow. just wow. exceptional service on a friday night at the bar. fast service, excellent food. everything tasted great , even the drinks. workers who weren't even serving us kept asking if everything was okay. haven't had such a smooth and efficient experience at a sports bar in such a long time!"
i used to love coming here but now this location has turned into a fraud. we paid with cash and card the right amount but then i found out they overcharged my card!! i'm sure they thought they could get away with this as they have probably done it to other customers before but i will raise hell if my problem is not solved when they open. honesty is a great trait to have as a business & i can say buffalo wild wings is not worth it
"the food was great! i ate buffalo wings, loaded fries, and chocolate fudge cake for dessert. the only con is that it's too warm almost hot, the ac should be turned down."
i have seriously been a fan of buffalo wild wings since the day they appeared in south floria. their product has always been consistently good and well priced.... until recently. i visited bww a couple of weeks ago and could not get over the strong smell of vinegar and flies everywhere. what happened to you guys?!? the wings for the most part will never change but the restaurant setting itself was almost intolerable and very difficult to sit through. who wants to be eating in a restaurant that smells like vinegar feet?! eek. on to the happy things: i love their fried pickles so much and since i'm a bit intolerant to spice so my tried and true will forever be the mild wings.
"boneless wings are all breading, i heard the traditional ones are better so i would try those service is slow, so you may experience a bit of a walthappy hour deals look good if you are in the area and want a drink"
"not clean. 2nd time we've been to this location and both times it's been dirty. the first time the women's restroom was an absolute disaster with pee and blood on the floor. floor is sticky anywhere you step in the entire place. menus are gross and gave food stuck to them.restaurant was near empty with only two tables that had ordered before us and we still waited 30 + minutes for our two meals. food was good, however, this will be our last visit to this"
"in give this place a second chance... it came to bad to worst. terrible service, employees are lazy and without any service vocation. don't waist your money go to macdonalds if there isn't no other choice..."
"buffalo wild wings gets three starts because they have the tiniest wings, but i do love their sauces, shout out to my spicy garlic and regular hot lovers.  this dolphin mall location gets very busy, especially on game days, so the restaurant does provide a nice atmosphere to watch sports.  they also have big tvs everywhere.  the drinks are a hit or miss depending on who the bartender is, so i usually just stick to beer.  wings and beer go together better anyway.  i also really enjoy their french fries, they are thin and crispy.  their menu has changed over the years, and they offer others items, but to me honest i have always just ordered their wings as my meal.  they usually have daily beer specials so make sure to ask.  service is whatever. just take it for what it is."
"buffalo wild wingssat at the inside bar at 5:40pm sunday,  browsed the menu waiting for the bartender to ask me what i wanted... yelled i would like a beer, finally got me a beer at 5:55pm. i tried to say i wanted something  eat, as he walked off...6:15pm, i dropped $6 on the bar and walked out!!!  bottom line, the costumer service sucks!!  i shouldn't have to yell for somebody to come ask if i wanted anything, especially if i'm sitting at the bar with only 3 other people!!!!  really!!!walking up to d&b and see if i can get better service up there"
"this location when it once opened, about almost a decade ago, was great. however, every time i've gone i rarely get decent service. the waiters are so slow! the seating is understandable to be slow during big fights and games. expect that. they don't allow reservations + it's in a mall, so they get the malls traffic. the drinks and water take so long. only when we are at the bar has the service been good. the servers make or destroy the expirience, they really need to be improved. i sit in tables with no wet naps, they take long to give me napkins and silverware. i use to work for this company so i know the demand managers ask for and that's why i am pointing these simple misses out."
"made reservations with the gm for a football draft at this location. when we arrive, no one knew about it nor did they gave an area available to accommodate us. very disappointed. we ended up having to move tables around ourselves to make the draft happen. it took some time to do. then, the floor in the bar area was gross and slippery and difficult to walk on. the service was terrible. we kept having to clean our own area and chase the servers to take orders and refill our drinks. very very disappointing. the food was just bar food. not a good experience."
"i love buffalo wild wings.. but i'm never coming back to this location. service is ok, but this last time i was there it was pretty bad. shouldn't have to wait 20mins for a bucket of bud light.. (or a water) which if it's busy it's completely understandable, but it wasn't.besides that, this is the dirtiest buffalo wild wings i've ever been to.the moment you walk inside you get hit by this really bad ""dirty old carpet"" smell.. (don't even know if they have carpet but if they don't it makes it that much worse, gawd knows what you're actually smelling)you have the option to sit outside on bird poop, with some nice sticky tables..(sticky enough to protect your napkins from flying away with the wind.. but hey, at least you get to breath some fresh air )also few tvs weren't working.. but they are covered in poop so you still have something to look at while you eat"
"this is a good place to go with a big group especially during their tuesday half off traditional days and of course, if you're craving wings after a full day at the mall. wings are good -  i usually go with honey bbq and lemon pepper and they haven't failed me yet! i also tried their cheese curds during my last visit and it's definitely something i'll get again. cleanliness of the place could be improved - there was a weird smell when you walk in and the menus were very sticky. service was okay - granted, we were a group of 14 but there was not a lot of customers during the time we were there and we still had to flag down our server. some of our orders were also incorrect and yes, again, we were a big group, but i feel like getting orders correct should be a given. they were also out of ranch and blue cheese...like how? you're a place for wings but what can you do? good wings, okay service, meh cleanliness. i only really come here when i don't have a choice."
"i was hungry and just wanted to eat dinner with my friends; we came in on 5/15/18 at 8:30 pm on a tuesday night the place was moderate not packed or nor empty we chose to sit in the outside dining area. after waiting for 10 minutes, no waiters ever came out to attend us nor the other tables where service was needed. we left, and also we advised a manager on staff what was happening. there won't be a next time here; i will choose another place before coming back to this restaurant. after so many bad reviews on yelp, i should have read the ratings before picking this place beforehand. it seems to me the employees don't have the best customer service skills either."
please never go to this restaurant. to start off they do not focus on customer service at all. the waiter only attended us once in an entire hour and 20 minutes with a glass of water. food came after an hours and a half.  my waiter didn't even come with my food. i ordered a cheeseburger with potato wedges & they brought me the wrong order to top it off. and the waiter shows up after was super sassy and rude saying i had it all wrong and was raising his voice. the man did not even bring even bring me a sauce or my food was some other lady and only came by to get money. horrid service. a disappointment to have gone here.
"food is fine but seriously what's with the smell. i never been to any restaurant, not even street food stalls in third world countries that smell worse than this joint. like seriously, it makes me want to vomit. for reals!!! why is this place this bad, has no one complained about this?"
"i drove for more than 30 minutes to this place, i arrived at 11:00 pm and they told me at the door that it was already closed even when there were people inside. there was not even to go because the system was already closed !! they should change the attention hours."
"we were doing a little shopping at dolphin mall and decided to have a quick bite at bww.  it's important to note that the restaurant was completely empty when we arrived.  we were seated right away.  we ordered a beer, only for the server to leave and come back 10 minutes later to tell us they no longer had it.  she wasn't particularly educated with the items bww offers, especially in the drink section.  while she wasn't rude or unwelcoming, she was just ""meh"".  she wasn't overly helpful and she definitely wasn't interested in providing quick or speedy service.  it took about 20-30 minutes for a salad and chili con queso to reach our table.  the food was decent, but again, just barely average service.  during our time at bww, at the most, there were maybe three to four other tables filled in the whole restaurant, but there were so many employees just standing around that at one time, i thought they were holding a staff meeting up at the entrance. nope, just socializing.  while the work flow may not be busy at that moment, it's never good to just see employees standing around, especially at the front doors of a restaurant in plain view."
"place smells like they took the concentrated scent of the inside of a chuckee cheese and sprayed it everywhere, then took some child vomit and used it to clean the floors.other than that it's a great place to have beer and watch a sports game, if you can stand the smell."
suuuuper bad bad bad bad bad bad service not even for free i would comeback. tip hire more people!!!!!!!
"i've been to this bww twice, and both times i've been left with a sour taste in my mouth. my most recent experience however, takes the cake.i came in with a friend of mine on a saturday night and we decided to sit by the tables near the bar. we perused the drink menu, decided on some drinks and even decided on our meal before our waitress came by to introduce herself and ask us if we wanted anything to drink. after waiting over 10 minutes to be attended to, you would think the waitress would at least greet us with a smile or any semblance of proper customer service but nope, she had an ""i'd rather be anywhere but here, attending you two"" vibe.  i ordered an alcoholic drink, and in the most condescending tone while smacking her lips, the waitress asks me for my id. i brushed it off because i do look young for my age and tried to not make anything of it, but that definitely set the tone for the entire dining experience which honestly shouldn't have lasted more than 45 min (we were there for almost 1.5 hours mind you). to top off that uncomfortable first encounter, she left before we could even open our mouths again to order our entrees. another 15 min later and she finally shows up with our drinks; my bahama mama and my friends moscow mule which wasn't served in a copper cup (is this not how moscow mules are supposed to be served?). she drops of the drinks and immediately leaves. once again, not allowing us to order nearly 30min after sitting down. my friend and i keep our eyes peeled for her, finally get her attention and call her over, after a couple minutes of chatting leisurely with a table of 4 men, she finally comes over to take our orders. i dictate my order and instead of writing it down, she just stared as the words came out of my mouth. my friend orders and she does the same. another 20 minutes later (drinks are empty and no water has been brought to us nor has she come over to see if we wanted to order another round), our food gets to the table. i took one look at my food, and knew it was incorrect. my burger had tomatoes and pickles which i had asked to remove, and was missing bacon which i asked to add. i inform the guy that brought the food over, and reiterated my order. he kindly apologized as he took my food back to the kitchen. in that moment, the waitress was passing by and asked ""whats wrong"", and he replies that the order was incorrect, and she, of course, rolled her eyes while she turned away to chat with the table of dudes. i'm furious at this point. i just want my burger so i can inhale it as quickly as possible, so i can get the hell out of that place. 10 min later, the burger arrives, i scarf it down, and we ask for the check as we wrap up eating our meal to expedite the process. my friend makes eye contact with her as she raises her hand to call her over, and the waitress legitimately turns away and ignores our table in order to continue talking to the table of men. to make this long story a bit shorter, we ended up waiting another 10 min while she spoke to the testosterone table, when she finally did reach us with the tab (my friend had her card in her hand to just hand it to her so she could take it without even looking at the price of the tab) and she just dropped off the tab despite seeing my friend attempting to hand her the card. another 10 min for her to come back, take the card, swipe, and finally liberate us from the 9th circle of hell.awful experience. awful waitress. she was too busy flirting and giving what i would assume, stellar customer service to that table, while neglecting ours. i wish i remembered her name or still had my receipt for reference to warn all yelpers to beware of this young woman. i do recall her being of average height, fair skin, and having blonde from a box colored hair.moral of the story - just spend your hard earned money elsewhere. the food court would literally be a better dining experience than this place."
"terrible service, the server was very slow and put in the orders late, never came back to refill water, forgot silverware, and forgot some of the orders. food came out cold. when the manager was called she did nothing to solve the problem her priority was to defend the server and did not listen to our complaints. she was very rude and inconsiderate. and they made gratuity included."
helen jones was great she went out of her way to take my husbands card because he left it on tab card. she's was great she went out her way to look for us and return card to us. thank you helen you were great
"i love the concept of buffalo wild wings!  people posting these ratings need to be realistic with their expectations.  if you go to a sports bar don't expect the filet mignon to be exquisite.i have always loved this chain and my favorite of the 20 different sauces is the mango habanero.  it is one of the highest levels on their heat index but the flavor is amazing.   servers are always kind, courteous and quick.  my only critique would be on the carpet... in my opinion i think that flooring is a challenging for any restaurant to maintain in the long term. i think the carpet may add to a little funky smell a few reviews mention.  overall this is my local spot for wings with great sauce not matter how commercialized this chain may be. mango habanero!!!"
"alvaro is amazing!! an asset to the bar. he is the reason we love returning. we hope the owner realizes just how fantastic he is! not just a skilled bar tender, he really knows how to connect with all his customers. felicia, also a brilliant bar tender, she has an awesome upbeat and engaging personality. without these exceptional personalities bbw is just another sports bar."
"we waited 30 min after being seated before the waitress came to get our drink order. one of the times she walked right by i asked her to get a waitress. she flat out ignored me. then another waiter kept stepping in for her cuz she would just disappear . we had to ask 5 times for utensils. as i was going to the ladies room , i over heard another waitress say that they were being that way cuz we are white. i'm sorry but i wasn't raised to discriminate anyone based on their skin color. my 6 yr old even heard the conversation. and was so confused. and most of the employees were too busy to be disturbed from their phones to do their jobs.my husband still never got a fork for his boneless wings.bad service and very rude workers.the food service guy was nice and trying to help but he was not the waiter"
met a couple friends for some drinks on a thursday night we sat at bar and ordered appetizers (which took forever) and a round of drinks the bar tender didn't even offer us any water or a second round not once. we asked for check and went else where.
"things i liked about this particular bww:1) closest large chain sports bar to my home..convenient location for anyone in cutler bay2) plenty of tv screens showing multiple sports3) the wings of which we ordered 6 varieties, were all consistently delicious, and on tuesday were only .60 ea. for bone-in. also, the fried pickles with ranch dipping sauce were ""addictive""4) service: we were served by ""shift leader"" john jenkins...he was very personable, and took excellent care of my daughters' drink needs!5) tuesday night trivia nation; this contest is mc'd by the lovely and capable stephanie. she conducts the contest fairly and competently, and with spotify on her laptop, she can play virtually any song you request!  prizes are for bww gift certs for 1st through 3rd place.things i didn't like:1) the smell....like some other soflo restaurants, it seems like the carpet or grease traps in the kitchen need cleaning, because it hits you as soon as you walk in.2) ...not judging here, but some of the clientele were a little rough around the edges....outside of a tattoo parlor, rarely have i seen so much ink in one place....3) the acoustics with the concrete floor and large cavernous layout make it difficult to converse, or listen to stephanie asking trivia questions even though she has a p.a.overall, 3 stars....i will probably return either for trivia on tuesday night or the afternoon drink specials before or after a movie at the cinema next door."
"i was staying right across the street and decided to come here for wings.   they have some good wings and will come out with new sauces every once in a while.  i like the vibe at the bar area,  over 21 crowd, tons of tvs and ntn buzztime trivia.    the dining area and outside area was packed and loud with kids.   i am glad that the bar area is separated from the main dining area.  our waiter was great."
"this review has been long over-due. i have visited this buffalo wild wings many times, since its grand opening a few years back. the town of cutler bay is growing, so when this sports bar came to the neighborhood it was exciting! i was visiting almost 2x a week. but all good things must come to a end. quality of the food; has gone down drastically. it's not the same as it use to be, sometimes you will get overloaded sauce on your wings or not enough sauce on your wings. sometimes they will even come out overcooked. the fries and wedges are the best hands down, if you dip it with blue cheese - yummy! pricing of the food; its ok. the prices have gone up, since when they first opened which is expected. now you cant order by how many wings you want they come in sizes; ie; small, large, etc. in terms of dollar signs its a ""$$"". the servers at this location are a hit or miss. i've had good and bad servers. my pet peeve is when they see your running low on drinks and they just keep bypassing you. (many of them do this) or they fail to check back to see if you need anything. they have huge tv's and lots of them! so if your looking to watch a sports game locally this is the spot. they also have happy hour at this location, i'm not sure the times but i know its one in the afternoon and at night. the parking is very spacious, you will find parking! no worries about this. they have free wifi and tablets you can use to play on the interactive screen. tuesday's they have trivia, which is fun. you can play to win discounts on future dine-ins."
"well,it's been a while since i've been here.  maybe tonight isn't a good night.  there is about 10-15 people on the bar side,and service is really sucking!!  if it's like this now,i would hate to see it on a busy night!!"
"not sure the name of the bartender, but the brunette female was not pleasant at all. food took way too long. no one came and asked if we wanted anything else. towards the end someone asked when we were ready to leave."
"it's a good b-dubs, my wings were a decent size (for a while they had gotten so small) the sauce was good too. drank a tall beer, no complaints. but if they continue to keep the air conditioning as low as it was on my visit i will be unable to return. it was freezing in there!"
the two stars is because i'm being nice. the food always taste like it's been laying out for hours and the drinks are always room temp. the staff is basically non existent and kind of ghetto. the location is also always very dirty and the tables seem sticky and have crumbs everywhere. also the carpets smell moldy.
visited this location with my family today and had a horrible experience. it took about 20 minutes each time we asked for a beer. the food was horrible. we sent back the wings and while we kept the 'steak' quesadilla it was subpar. i've had better 'steak' at taco bell for $2.79.never coming back here.
just bad! service sucks!!wings suck! burger took 30 minutes and they said because they are frozen !
"this location has really dropped off in the last year or so. there aren't many dining options nearby, so i've been multiple times and left disappointed each time. i'm finally done after my wife, daughter and i were all sick later on after he last two visits.it appears to this somewhat trained eye that like the stores around it at southland mall, they are close to going out of business.everything is wrong with the dining experience. i was usually a lunch patron, which isn't busy at all, but always waited a long time to even place an order, and even longer receive it.  impossible to get in and out if you're on a lunch hour and need to get back to the office.food is always inconsistent. i order basically the same size  meal each time, (small traditional wings and fries) and yet it never comes out the same way twice. sometimes too dry. sometimes overcooked. sometimes undercooked. sometimes a different color, like the fryer grease needs to be changed. no consistency in the kitchen. my family tried to change up their orders with each visit, but we're discouraged from doing so as the server constantly has to apologize for being ""out"" of this or that item so they went back to their same meals, again, only for all three of us to have stomach issues shortly after leaving. my understanding is this location is operated by the same as the sunset place location, and i haven't had any of the same issues there.this location better get it's act together quickly, or it'll be as empty as the (former) k-mart is across the parking lot. they've lost my patronage for good. can't trust the kitchen or the service. sorry, guys."
worst service and worst wings ever the buffalo wild wings in pembroke pines is better its just inconvenient for people down south . i would give them zero stars people only come on tuesdays for the special.
"i think i'm going to start off by saying that they had great service. we went on a weekday night (non game day) so the place was fairly empty. but we still decided to eat outside because it was unusually cold inside. our server, a male with dark hair and a short cut, was incredibly pleasant and patient. he checked on us multiple times and didn't groan each time we changed an order.my friend and i weren't too hungry so we decided to split a sampler platter and order a batch of fries on the side. man were we stuffed. the platter, which comes with an assortment of fun foods on the menu was kinda more than we could handle. i'd definetly recommend ordering a platter and splitting it with a friend because it gives you the most bang for your buck and you get to taste various things in the menu! the fries were also delicious. you can make them loaded for a couple cents more. definetly worth it."
"just simple and wish management of buffalo wild wings (main branch) read this! i don't have problem with the quality of the food but what make me concern is about a timing they close! it's a many times (i don't remember anymore, just to many times) either i make order by the phone or walking in the last 30 minutes they always said close! maybe me and my friends kinda customers who mostly coming lil bit late to placing a order (by the phone for to go order, either come by visiting bdubs at southland mall) i truly understand it's about 30 minutes away to close but common guys?! well i guess they need changes they hourly (specially on the weekdays) to put close at 11.30 pm and last call probably 11.00 pm or 11.15 pm thank you and hopefully they pay attention about this or better they changes they hourly on websites or on the store! pardon my english!"
"you know....if you're going to coming here, you better make sure j.j. the bartender is on duty. we ordered our drinks and the food at 11pm. after a long day you kinda want to unwind. the drinks were not poured to the top of the glass. the food we ordered was delivered on dirty plates, sauces missing, no silverware or plates offered, and if that's not enough to gross you out, the bartender (who does wear a name tag) charged us for a drink we didnt even order. the less than basic service expected was garbage."
"my wife and i go there a couple of times a month the wings are very good, and the beer is cold. we like to try the flavors of the month and have had some really good ones. service is ok, and there are a bunch of tv's. the sauces and rubs go from sweet to very spicy, something for everyone."
bland so so food in an adult chukee cheese setting. i just can't get into this place. i would give her two stars but the service is actually pretty decent. it's ok but they have better wings and burgers almost everywhere. the only thing they really have is tv's but everyone has those. pick up your game.
"first time here and nice little hidden gem. food was great, service was a little slow because i came on a game night but that's expected.definitely will come back.  our second bartender was very attentive to us but be prepared to ask for all the little extras."
"""ooooo that smell, can't you smell that smell..that smell is all around you.."" in this case it's the smell of stale beer and puke. if your not fully disgusted yet. try the bathroom. hello corporate? hello? anyone listening?close and steam clean this entire place!my review is gross!"
"i wouldn't normally rate this restaurant at a one; but after tonight's encounter with the servers and management, customer service was deplorable in regard to our dining experience. i would have to say that this restaurant earned this rating. the restaurant was packed as it is a saturday night, so we opted to sit at the outside bar. simply stated, we ordered wings, french fries, and buffalo mac -- an order that should not have taken more than 15-20 minutes. it took us 56 minutes to receive our food; the wings were most certainly sitting under the heat lamp because the wing sauce had that dead look to it. everything tasted as it normally would but we were so turned off to the situation, that we wanted to leave as soon as possible afterward. moral of the story: i am a server and my restaurant understands how important guest satisfaction is; this restaurant clearly does not. a full restaurant does not warrant inadequate service or that excuse to be offered to a guest as the ratiocination behind which sub par circumstances are deemed acceptable. we will not be returning any time soon. we hope that you read this review and take it into consideration because it is very saddening to see a restaurant that is typically fun and accommodating treat guests like they are expendable."
"tv's were great. kinda muggy with the air conditioning, i wish it was cooler: food was great no problem. i just wished they would clean tables quicker and this place will be a good place. they over staffed waiters but none would touch a dirty plate. i give it a overall 2. but i know they can do better."
if you're hungry for a slice if chocolate cake you need to drop in here. they have a big slice of double chocolate cakes with delicious creamy chocolate frosting covered in mini chocolate chips. it is one of my favorite chocolate cakes around.
"yelp challenge 2017 : 39/100when we entered the location it was fairly empty but we still had to wait 15 minutes before the hostess gave us a table. the hostess then became our waitress and took the drink orders. 10 mins later we received our drinks and she took our order. she then returned to her role as hostess. my sister then became our waitress and located straws, silverware and napkins. another 15 mins later the appetizers arrived and after assisting every other table she returned to the hostess stand. our party was a party of eight so i was able to sample a lot of different menu items. the food was cooked well and tasted good. it would be awesome if we had our drinks refilled timely to make the meal complete. the prices where reasonable and the place was clean. our hostess/waitress  became the  ""busier"" and bused the table- she even turned two of them on their side to make sure she could sweep underneath. i don't know if this location is under staffed or if everyone else called out this day. by the time we left she was serving 9 tables. i would not return to this location."
2nd attempt at this place. placed an online order of 5 wings and a burger at 930pm to pick up at 10pm. as soon as i paid i was told that my chicken wings had to be made again. after noticing most of the workers hanging out by the bar or in the kitchen i approached one to finally check on my order at 10:20pm. came out 5min later with the order. to get home to a ruined burger! just want to say thank you to the lazy people who clearly need a more challenging job since chillin by the bar or in the back is not good enough...garbage
"probably some of the worst service i have ever seen. food took forever, when it was delivered, our entire order was not complete.  there was hardly anybody in the place so the ""we are so busy"" excuse doesn't work. the waitress often went missing for extended periods of time. some food came out burnt and they attempted to hide it by covering it with others food on the plate. automatic 18% gratuity for service so poor was a disgrace. 2 1/2 hour dinner service was ridiculous."
"had a grood experience here however, i was there at a slow time and still had to wait 25mins before being attended to, this needs to be improved.the general staff seemed to be doing their own thing with  not much care about attending to the customers. a good twist was my particular server was great, friendly. wings were really tasty. didn't have to wait too long for my order. wide selection of draft beers and bottled. location was clean. lots of tvs all around so you can watch what you like.i'm here whenever im in town."
"went for lunch. maybe 10 tables of customers at most in the place. not busy at all. took 45 min to get food. asked manager for a concession for the wait. said he was new and can't do it because he didn't want to look bad. if you have 2 hours to spend for lunch, go ahead. but if you don't, then go to the many other places in the area."
if i could rate it a zero i would. worst service possible. it takes about 1 hour to just get food on a thursday night. and the sad part is that there is no one else to serve. i have never had such bad service. i would speak to the manager but the manager was not available. i would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.
"this is a nice chill wings bar that's in a lot of locations throughout miami and broward. they have a different pick/variations of wings sauces which is cool. now for happy hour they have a plate of tuna tacos with french fries- pretty good, even though the tacos are tiny bit along with the wings and beer you will be filled. they have tall and medium beer glasses, at least if you get a blue moon. not quite sure about other beers. and last, service... it's normal i guess ... nothing special."
ordered dinner for my family on grubhub half the order didn't come when grubhub asked to speak to a manager he denied a refund or to send what was missing will never order from here again ps wings are not even that great!
consistently good wings. better than average service and lots of sports tvs.  a regular wing stop for me.
"extremely surprised it took 20 mins for water and when it finally gets here no straws. mind you the entire time we were here there only was like four tables besides us and about 7 waitresses and waiters.  once the food got here is was kinda cold, and they didn't give us plates to share the food. then when they do give us ""plates"" the waitress brought a card board tray and tossed it on our table. she was rude and had a attitude. as we were eating we heard her walking by saying didn't want to take care of us and wanted a another waitress to transfer to us.  the next waitress was great and attentive. with this experience i honestly don't see my self going back to another buffalo wild wings again, because i've gone to one other branch and i experienced almost the same thing.*update* it's the next day and i seem to have food poisoning from this place. i've had a stomach ache and been throwing up all night."
rudest people ever !! hire normal people who know to serve food instead of rolling their eyes and throwing food on the table ..
"this place has to be open because someone needs to declare a loss.  a three year-old can run a place better.no customers.  no host/hostess, waited to be seated for 15 minutes and when only spoke up.dirty tables all around.food just barely fair.  never. going back"
"i'm not a big b dubs fan in general, as i like to frequent a different wing chain, but i've never had a problem with this location's service or food. the first time we went here, they were out of a ton of beers that they advertise on their menu. however, they had my sibling's favorite beer on tap for happy hour so it was all good. the beer was like $3 or something which is a great deal. i think both times we've visited this location, my sibling had a new times deal/certificate (kind of like a groupon) for buffalo wild wings. the server happily accepted the gift certificate and gave no attitude, which was appreciated. it was also tuesday most likely which means 50 cent wings. the wings come hot and crispy and i enjoyed trading wings with everyone else at the table to try the different flavors.we ordered a few appetizers off their happy hour menu. the most memorable one was the loaded chips. they are thick cut potato chips, freshly fried and topped with bacon and cheese. we enjoyed our time eating these, so the wait for the wings didn't seem long at all.the server was also very nice about our party putting in an order for a couple of beers in advance since happy hour was going to end soon."
"i want to start off by saying i love buffalo wild wings but this location was by far the worst one i have ever been to and i'm not one to take the time to write a review. it started off from the second we walked in, the smell of the inside was over powering so we ate outside. we were told it was self seating so we sat wherever. 10-15 minutes pass and no sign of waitress. i noticed another couple left because their waitress was also taking too long. finally we decided to go inside and ask them if anyone could come to our table. the food came out pretty fast and was really good, the food wasn't the issue. silverware wasn't provided and we were both eating boneless wings so we just sat there until someone walked by and i asked for silverware and there was no sign of him after that. finally after a few minutes pass i finally see our waitress and ask for silverware. after all that you really couldn't imagine it being any worse but then we received one refill throughout the whole meal. once i was finished eating i was ready for the check but it felt like ages until she came back to our table to ask if we were done, i was considering leaving at that point. i also noticed that they were cleaning up the outside and cleaning right under our feet instead of offering us refills and checking up on their other tables. it was around 10 when we came in and they close at 2."
"i ate here with my family, we order some wings, a cheese burguer, onion rings and drinks. the wings were ok but one had a hair on it, the meat of the burger was super dry, cold and flavorless, i also add a side of mushrooms and when they came they were like 5slides of mushrooms . the flavor of the onion rings, not that bad but they were cold and super greasy, the drinks were super sweet.besides all that the customer service was terrible our server brought our food and then disappeared for ever, i had to wait 20min to get my check and it was because i had to go and find her. sorry, definitely not coming back, it's not the same as before.."
"i'm not a big wings person but the wings here are great, not to mention the variety of sauces that you can pick from! service is always very friendly and fast!"
"so we stopped by before going to the mall and the bf was craving wings. . .so you would think win win situation right??  naw. . .not really.  =(  our server amber was all over the place.  she was like a chicken with it's head cut off just walking around not getting anything right.  at one point, she was walking around with a dish going to every table that she had asking if they had ordered it.  i was like huh?  look at your orders. . .what does it say?i don't know if she was just overwhelmed or not but she was making mistakes left and right and it was with all her tables not just mine.  service was a total miss 1/5the food was decent tho.  we got the house sampler and it was decent. onion rings rocked... nachos was sub par but the fresh jalapenos were a nice touch to the entire nachos.  3.5/5now i got the their hottest spice with the boneless wings. . .i forget the name but basically it was their fire in other words, there was none spicier.  but it was hilarious because as the food runner was dropping off my dish, he said. . .you won't be able to finish this. . .lol  if he only knew.  i love spicy food and it totally hit the spot.  it was perfectly crunchy and well covered with the sauce and yes the sauce was hot but it has good flavor.  (5/5)will i be back. . .most likely yes if we are ever in that area again.  =)"
"we walked right to the table where we were told the server would come along shortly... then minutes later we received glasses of water and was told again that our server would come over...the person who brought the water was the host...then 20 minutes later still no waiter or any wait staff stopping by our table to ask us for help or our order...i saw other people arrive to their tables after us and had a waiter there right away...i am very disappointed, i saw a manager going around to other tables checking them if they were okay and hoping he would come by, but never came to our section of the restaurant...i saw many wait staffers pass by us looking at us and just walk pass us...basically over 30 minutes later, we got up and left...i was very annoyed...i do not recommend this location and it's a shame because the food is good but had a horrible night there."
"you couldn't pay me to eat here again. anthony at  the bar was beyond rude. he gave me nothing but attitude. he had his iphone headphones in his ears while he's at work. who has a job they can wear their apple headphones while serving customer.  don't waste your time at this location. they don't acknowledge u at the door.,you might get attitudes from anthony at the bar. now im staring at my food in hopes he didn't spit in it."
came as my daughter loves wings. we waited close to 10 minutes sitting in the table ready to give our order. i had to get up twice to ask someone for a waiter to take our order. the restaurant was half full. food is average other than wings which is obviously their specialty. i will come back due that my daughter likes it. not my personal favorite.
"this piece of crap restaurant doesn't deserve one star! here's a clue, buffalo wild wings - customer service is numero uno! shut 'em down!"
"first time here and it was a wonderful experience (service wise) the food on the other hand was not that good. boneless wings were hit and fresh but none of the sauces were that good. my favorite was the dry rub, desert heat. we also braved their hottest sauce ""blazin"" which was reaallllllll hot. our bartender ""angel"" was amazing! he was really funny and he entertained us the whole time. he is an outstanding bartender and should be working somewhere with a more substancial crowd because this place is dead. 4 stars because the food was mediocre but the service was a 10!!"
"always a good go to spot to watch football games and eat wings, they had a featured blue moon wing sauce that was really good, waiting for that sauce to become available again"
went around 1 pm on a thursday so it was pretty empty and got really great service from our server amber! food came out fast and warm. their deal for boneless wings on thursday is absolutely great and a great value.
great place for date night. my waitress tayler was very nice and the food was excellent. would most definitely come back for another date night.
"2nd time here.  i think we are done for a while.  very nice chicken wings and a great concept where you can get many diff flavors of wings in one order.  though there are other bar food items you can order here, it is basically a chicken wing based sports restaurant/bar   we counted at least 30 tv's.  i'm sure it is packed when there is a sporting event. really enjoyed the wings. but i get chicken wing cravings maybe once every 6 months.  and honestly, tysons hot wings from the frozen section in the grocery store, zapped for 5 min in the microwave, will satisfy those cravings. see you in a year.  maybe. ."
it's been a few years since my last stop in and the kid wanted wings so we took a shot. much better experience overall. th service was fast and friendly. the food was flavorful and quickly served. the atmosphere was sporty. overall a much better experience than the first go round. worth coming back and seeing if the trend continues.
the service was terrible!! waited for 15 minutes on the table no even water was offered! end up leaving without ordering!
second time trying bww. first time was about 2 years ago at dolphin mall i believe. this location was trash me and my friend stop by and order take out for lunch worst idea ever a waste of $26. mac & cheese was bland no sauce i might as well have been eating the noodles straight out the pot after they boil the noodles...the wings were terrible i think the flavor i tried was bourbon honey mustard blahh! my friend had the macaroni bites might as well roll macaroni in flour and placed them in a box. i wouldn't recommend this location to anyone.
"i am not sure what is so great about their wings. i have had much better ones most of the times i have eaten them elsewhere. i like buffalo medium. service is fair at best. fries are always cold. i do like the atmosphere with the tvs but with the food being what it is, i don't like to go there for games."
"been to buffalo wild wings numerous times. this was the same, but the service was incredible. linda was by far the best server i've ever had at a buffalo wild wings anywhere."
"i'm gving bww 4 stars because the service was phenomenal, but the food was just decent. i ordered the loaded chips with chicken (a previous favorite from their menu) and was not impressed. not that i expected an extravagant meal, but it was bland for my liking (and has definitely been tastier in the past). thankfully, our server was very friendly and saved the day with some great drink recommendations!"
i will not be going back to buffalo wild wings in the pembroke pines area. the food took 40 mins to come out and there were only 3 groups of couples in the restaurant on a late thursday night. once the food came out the fries were cold and hard.
this is probably one of the places that i wouldn't come any more.they made me wait almost 1 hour just for 5 wings and barely no one here! waitress never came back to check up on me or fill my cup up. my partner got wings and a few of them were not fully cooked with red spots on it smh. i don't recommend this spot to anyone.
"was seated for 10 mins before i asked for a manager to come to the table. no one ever acknowledged us sitting down. the server came as i was asking for the manager.. i was assured she would still stop by our table. she never came.. the server was good in the beginning but left us sitting for another 20 mins, all we wanted was the check. i won't be coming back."
we travel to this location because the one less than a mile from us has never gotten our order right. the staff here keeps your drinks full checks on you. great food.
"i went there on a sunday during a packer game because i knew they showed all sports and have enough tvs to accommodate my request . i wanted to watch the final fed ex cup golf tournament. tiger woods was going for his first win in 5 years!!!! he could possibly win the entire fed ex cup! they said they can't put it on because they don't have enough ""boxes"". 40 tvs, but not enough receivers to show one of the greatest ever moments in golf! i had 1 beer and left. extremely disappointed!!!"
"it's a bw3. it's close to work. they have food, sold! nothing earth shattering here. i come to bw for lunch often enough and i have enjoyed decent food here. they have every sauce imaginable for your wing fix and when i get a wing fix and i'm out at work i come here as it does the job. not much more you could ask for here really. they do the whole lunch in less than 15 minutes timing thing which is nice because this place has sometimes been beyond slow. nothing out of the ordinary here. walking into this bw3 is like walking into any one of them around the midwest. typical fare. not great but not bad either. as this place has a ton of tv's it's not a bad place to catch a game. only difference is i would find the bw closer to my home should i decide to do that."
"the new lunch menu is what you would expect.  one should gage the reputation of bww because expecting the same thing is a comfort to many.  this is indeed comfort food.  if you need fancy cheeses and wine you are not at the right place.  if you want burgers, wings, and beer you have a good chance for enjoyment.  i tried the naked boneless wing.  nope, lesson learned on trying to be healthy here.  go for the caloric yummies and beer.  you'll be happy you did.  hope you have a run plan for the morning because to stay under 1,000 calories with all this good stuff will be very difficult!"
order take out...forgot to put my wing my sauce in the bag. ggrrr put hot chicken in the same box as my salad = soggy wilted lettuce = gross! thx for ruining my lunch.
super slow service.  it took over 45 to get our food.  will not be back to this location ever again. we tried again after bad service the last time.  never againexplains why there are no customers.
"food was fine, but service was so slow.  there is only one other table with customers and at least 8 people on wait staff.  i had to wait 15 minutes for a refill on my pepsi.  i'm pretty easy going, but come on..... unreasonable wait time with no customers.  just watched the wait staff hang around and talk to each other.  2nd time this has happened to me at this locration. 3 bucks for a soft drink is a little high....."
"so disappointed. we walked in yesterday, 5/19 around 6pm. we asked for a booth and were told there would be a one minute wait. fine. however, that was a lie. we waited nearly 15 min for a booth while the blonde hostess sat around giggling with her friends. she was even commenting on how ""hot"" a customer was that just walked in.... so rude. she didn't find someone to clean the table until i stood up and looked at her like she was crazy. strike 1.she then puts us at a booth, finally!! we sit down and get a waiter named scott. scott was nice and he meant well. he brought us our drinks fairly quickly. we ordered wings and a salad. after waiting for what seemed like forever for the salad, we realize we didn't have any utensils. strike 2.eventually, the wings came. cold. strike 3.honestly this place is not worth your time. the people are rude and it is overall uninviting. 1 star."
"our party of 8 had excellent service.  when they burned my mother-in-law's entrée, the manager personally came out to apologize and tell her that her meal would be on the house.  i had a really good black cherry cocktail.vegetarians are pretty much limited to the build-your-own black bean burger.  which is fine.  i guess.  my black bean patty was overcooked.  i've definitely had better.  but it's something for us."
meh! had a very uninspiring lunch here after coming into town. place was half empty but smelled wonderful. wish our food tasted half as good. will was our server he was okay at best. guess i realize now why i don't go to this chain much. disappointing!
"hello fellow yelpers, this review is for the bww on capital drive.so i come herenprolly once every few weeks and each time the staff is friendly. and the food is hot. some times there is a moderate wait but understandable as some times we come during the dinner rush. i always order a large and split it with the gf she likes the honey bbq and i like the medium. with a order of cheese curds. yummy.  but i have never had any problems with this location. it's very consistent in terms of food and friendliness if you know what times to come in it can be the best experience if not your going to be mad and upset because you're  not a patient person. but the cleanness of the bathrooms and general area are kept up and the people that clean the tables normally do a good job if not just request them to clean it that simple.5 stars for doing what they do best."
"don't know why we keep coming back. the service in this place keeps going downhill. unfortunately applebee's nearby is not better. we got sat and waited 5 minutes. then went to find someone to get ilya a server. funny thing is that about 3 of them were milling about. only deanna seemed to be working. burgers are so-so, wings are good. unfortunately there are not many sports bar type options in the pewaukee/sussex area to take the kids to. tip to the management:  have your servers hang around by the customers not buried in the corner of the kitchen."
five stars for service!! tina answered the phone for my take out order on 3/23/17 around 7:30pm. it's was boneless night and they were very busy but she was sooo patient with me while i was placing my order. she even offered to wait on the phone while i double checked the orders for those around me. i appreciated it so much. she really went out of her way to complete my order and assured  me i was not a bother to her at all. my order was perfect and i will be back! thanks tina!!
poor service compared to other locations.  price a little on the high side for fries and chicken wings.
"in the expansive, suburban wasteland of paved parking lots sits many mediocre chain restaurants such as applebees, noodles, panera bread and, of course, buffalo wild wings.it's 10:30pm- i mean where can you go when you are in the western suburbs of milwaukee?  we thought we knew what we were getting into as we have been to other bww before.  not so. we ordered an appetizer platter and a order of wings + beers to wash 'em down.the wings were overcooked, or cooked 5 hours previously only to sit underneath the searing warmth of the heat-lamp until they were served to me. i will give it to them, their hottest, hot wings are pretty hot for a chain restaurant, but when the meat is nearly inedible its not even a consolation for the restaurant.we did enjoy the jalapeno poppers, however, the cheese sauce still had the ""skin"" on it.  anyone who has worked in a restaurant that made cheese soup or any cheese based liquid knows what the ""skin"" is.  serving that shit to customers means you weren't paying attention and don't care.on the plus side, huge seasonal beers for only $6.50 is a major reason to go here for game day, get plastered, hop in a car and get a dui on the way home.  suburbia, shake my head."
"every time we go here, something is always screwed up with our food. wrong items, stale items, missing items are the norm. currently waiting to pick up our online order that was supposed to be ready 30 minutes ago. hard to think of a time that things have ever gone 100% correctly."
"first - it's a bww, so those of you expecting something else should just stop now.within the chains this is one of the better ones.  clean, food comes out correctly, wings aren't overcooked, service is competent, and at times good.like all of them ample tvs, sports, pay per views, and trivia are a staple.has the bar sunk that low for bws?  well i think it has and breaking the mold here makes me happy as i enjoy a crappy buffalo wing and some sports with friends now and again and this place covers that desire."
absolutely horrible service. hostess was rude and we seem to be a bother to her. asked for a booth. she said there was none available. asked about one of the open ones and she said it was dirty. we told her we would wait for it to be cleaned. she huffed and cleaned one.(why aren't they cleaned when the customer leaves). once she cleaned it another person sat us there. he said someone would be right over. nobody came. we left. nobody said a word. we are now at the one on bluemound in brookfield. they are awesome! drive past the pewaukee store and come here. it's worth it and obviously the pewaukee store doesn't need the money!
"i know it's a chain, but this place stands out among the other bw3's, in my opinion. the atmosphere is fun but it's the waitstaff that really sets the place apart. really really good service! i come here a lot, because i'm on a low-carb diet and i can eat yummy chicken wings. it's a great experience."
this place has great food if you dont mind waiting for service for 15 plus minutes.  this would not be so frustrating if not for the 6 wait staff standing up front talking among each other while we waited and waited for some one to take the order.
well you see i patiently waiting to be seated and this nice young man sat across from me and my shishtar after he sat we made if memes out of him. oh what a good laugh we had. but then shortly after his mom came and started fixing his hair and his button up shirt slowly he just became more of a meme. i strongly recommend this place if you are looking for a good laugh... ps. if you are this dude come find me
"an hour lunch break is not long enough!i decided to give this location another shot after they burned me several months ago. big mistake!my order of naked tenders came out forty-four minutes later, which meant i didn't have time to, you know, eat my food. when i brought up their ""15 minute or it's free"" guarantee the server talked to the manager... and gave me 25% off. *rolls eyes*. last time they used the excuse 'that doesn't apply to take-out orders' when it took more than a half hour.i used to eat bww multiple times a week but i don't think i will ever return to one again, this location or otherwise.avoid this place like the plague!"
"i used to love this place.  perfect man hangout.  beer, sports, and wings.  now this place is a joke!!  service used to be so good and now it sucks.  i came here for the first packer game.  sat for almost 10 minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge us sitting here meanwhile 1 bar tender and 2 waitresses are just standing at the end of the bar, not noticing that we are sitting here without being helpled.  i had to flag one down to help us.  i tried ordering 3 beers off of their menu and they were out of all of them.  i ordered wings and they were good, but had to ask her for napkins because there was not even 1 at our table.  then i ordered a bloody mary and asked for a chaser and they told me that that would be an extra dollar.  by the way, this place was half empty for a packers/bears game and i sure know why after this terrible experience!!  i will never come back here!!"
basically your typical buffalo wild wings. fairly big space for the area. i've never had a problem being seated right away. staff is always friendly. i've been in here a few times when the bar area is a little slow but other than that no issues.
"we were so upset from another restaurant so we decided to try bww. it was 10:30 yet they accepted us with smiles. our server was a young man named joshua. sitting on the side of us were there young males. they ate and ate and ate. they drank specialty drinks and ordered to go. once they were done they ordered ranch dressing and left without paying the bill. how upsetting!!! i wish those boys get there karma !!!! our server was still so pleasant even though he was ditched on his tip, etc. thank u to the manager for not closing early like unos and having this great employee on your staff."
customer service here is awful! so badly wish there were another bww closer by. tried to get dinner at 9 pm on a friday night - restaurant was maybe a quarter full but because they have no staff - had to wait 30 mins for a table. how does a busy place like this not have enough staff on a friday night to at least fill a restaurant half way. not to mention the last three times i've eaten here we've the order wrong or incomplete. super disappointing. last time i asked for the manager he gave me a crap load of excuses as to why we waited an hour and a half for food and why we had no drinks for about a half hour. and he gave me expired coupons for a future visit that i couldn't even use. super sketchy. i'd rather drive to west allis and go to that location.
"we stopped going here for ""after game dinners"" with our football, baseball, and basketball teams because the service was always slow and rarely correct. local places in germantown offer more menu variety and just as many televisions for games. i placed a to go order today at 6:00pm. it was supposed to be ready around 7:10 (over an hour for a to go order but it's a college bowl game day and busy, i get that). i go to pick it up at 7:10. it's not ready. i wait 10 more minutes then ask how much longer it will take, ""should i come back later?""the cashier responds you might want to go and come back, it's going to be a while. i proceed to cancel my order, which has been paid for, and ask to speak to the manager and have my payment refunded. after 20 more minutes the manager (who was very professional and very apologetic) took care of everything. during the 30 min i waited there i saw 3 tables send things back and multiple tables waited 10 min before being waited on, one table left before anyone helped them. the orders of snack and small boneless wings were given to me free of charge but for all of the waiting were completely cold and still wasn't correct - i have to laugh about that. i will never return to this place. the service has continued to disappoint. our team functions will continue at barley pop, brisco county, or bubs, but never again at buffalo wild wings."
"this used to be a regular lunch stop for me, working right up the road; i had very little complaints but very little to be excited about.unfortunately, tonight must have been both ""international bring your kids out for wings night"" and ""understand the hell out of bdubs"" night at the same time.despite the sole bartender being clearly overwhelmed (i went without silverware for my meal until i asked and the guy next to me audibly said, ""jesus christ"" as he sat unattended for 5+ minutes) she was in good spirits. though, dropping stuff and tossing receipts and leaving all of the above on the bar floor was ridiculous unprofessional...the fries are consistent and tasty, the wings are tasty but less than consistent; some times drowning in sauce, sometimes nearly naked. i really don't get anything else here; if i want a burger, i'll go to a burger joint, not a wing joint.lastly, their ""seasonal"" central waters draft beer was mudpuppy porter, an exceptional brew that quickly showed the quality of their draft lines: awful. i more or less choked down a dirty beer i'd normally savor, making this trip my last."
"i like their wings which is why i go back, but the service is pretty bad. literally just walked in on a friday night, was told there was a 30 minute for 2 with a more than half empty restaurant. clearly staffing is an issue. i guess my orders will be limited to carry out if anything at all going forward."
the food was cold when it was brought out. we were served vegetables that were well past their expiration date. our ketchup bottles were empty and we couldn't find the waitress to get a new one. i watched as waiters wondered past table full of trash. as garbage was finally wiped onto the floor it sat there for the remainder of our meal. what a waste of money and time! don't attend this bw3's! it's awful!
the food was poor and the service was worse. unless you go there for the sports on tv this is a must skip type of place. the boneless wings were a lump of breading with bad sauce. i had high hopes for this place but they just failed to deliver. never refilled sodas and when we ask for a separate plate we got a paper basket.
doesn't even deserve a 1 star but it's the lowest rating to give. terrible service. our waitress didn't come take our drink orders for 15 minutes. took another 10 minutes and we still didn't have any drinks and no sign of waitress. heard the table behind us complaining to the waitress about food they never got. we dipped outta dodge after that.
"terrible. just terrible. skip it unless you're looking for a beer. wait, skip it even then. beer is flat. wings were burnt and under sauced. spoke to manager who said he won't eat the wings here as he is a vegan. wtf??"
"i love bw3's but this location needs better service.  i've waited almost an hour for chicken.  i placed an order over the phone, picked it up and it was wrong!  called and the manager said he would send me a $15 gift card.  that was september 19, 2017 right after my car accident. never got it, so i called again.  he took my name again and said they'll send it out.  today is february 28,2018, and i have not received anything from them.  the kitchen and management needs to be efficient."
"the service was slow, my wings were burnt, they didn't have enough sauce on them.....the staff has a select few who seem to care. if you're looking for wings, go to the buffalo wild wings in pewaukee it is much better. just was back at this location and the service still sucks."
tonight's service was extremely slow & poor. it seemed as if our waiter and another waitress were the only ones on duty. tuesday is 1/2 off day you would think they'd be better staffed. also where we were sitting the air was on so we basically sat in our coats while eating. the appetizer and wings came out together which were quickly cooled off by the air. asked if air could be turned down...was given the circulation of air excuse. the air seemed to stay right on top of us. they received 1 star because you have to rate in order to review. definantly won't be back to this bww.
"if you want horrible service , go here! first of all our waitress had only 1 table and our service was as if we were in a packed full busy hour. my margarita i ordered was wrong, but our waitress came back about 14 minutes later and by then i just drank some cause i didn't know when she'd be back. still paid for drink, never complained. told waitress what was wrong, no apology nothing. we then ( party of 4 ) ordered food and apps which came pretty fast but half of sides we ordered ( carrots and celery ) never came. again when our waitress was actually at our table i asked for the carrots and celery she forgot she was rude, never apologized and got them for us. overall not a good experience at this specific buffalo wild wings. will not be going back for dine in service. will be taking my business somewhere else!!! i was so aggravated. even when i went to pay and gave my husband's military id she looks apauled that she'd have to get a manager and fix the check. rude. i wish i knew her name!!!! she needs to be fired!!"
"2nd time here and again the fries are cold. how can that be??  wrap meat was also cold. won't becoming back to this one. will have go back to the one in west bendalso, why are the fried pickles always in clumps??"
"sadly, i must agree with others in that the service here is, unfortunately, terrible. my food, time and time again, never comes to me hot - always room temperature or semi-cold.  service is where i have my biggest point of contention. it's wildly slow with one tableside check in, if i'm lucky. if i ask for sauce or a refill (shouldn't have to ask for a refill to begin with), it takes forever. the food will come to you as it looks in pictures but it might be cold and it might take a bit longer than you want. i've been to other buffalo wild wings and i've had better experiences."
"we arrived at about 1:00. we were told there was a twenty five minute wait, which was fine. ended up sitting there for about fifty minutes only to find out they crossed our name out because they couldn't find us. mind you we were sitting in the same spots that entire time. finally after we asked them what was going on we were seated. ordered our drinks, fifteen minutes later we got our drinks. i didn't get the drink i ordered but was officially done dealing with the garbage service.  i've never had a bad experience with buffalo wild wings up until we came to this location.  the server we had was polite, maybe not trained properly or had too many tables. the girl working the front desk was not very helpful or polite, possibly could use an attitude adjustment.  will not return."
i like this place when not super busy. i prefer the dry rub on my wings. always good and the manager brought me more fries!
never disappoints.  online orders give you a pick up time and it always takes 10 minutes longer for the food to be ready.  then when you get it home it's all cold.  wings are fatty.  just overall not good.  it's a lot of money to be disappointed each time.  one of these days i'll learn.
"this is a pretty good bww. when they have the lunch timer, the service is great, otherwise lunch is free. i went in there a couple of times when they didn't  have the timer and we had to flag down the server for more drinks and the check! i always get the boneless wings with teriyaki, which is always very good. they also have good iced tea."
"no more b3w for me. every time we go it is slow service. every dang blasted location. this was our last dance with you. it isn't that the wings are bad. i like the wings. it is just slow service. employees seem to ""hang out"" with each other near the kitchen.oh well."
"food was delicious, and made in a timely fashion. the cashier katie was very friendly, and helpfull, overall a great experience."
"during my most recent visit to this establishment i was quite disappointed with the service. we were seated right away which was great, but then it all went down hill from there. after we were seated and gave our drink orders, the waitress took very long to bring them. they were all very similar drinks so we were kind of angered by the wait. once she came back with them, she had brought us another drink that we didn't order. it was a complete waste of our time. now that we had our drinks we ordered our food. we had been there many times before and had horrible experiences as well so we decided this was one of the last chances we were going to give. it took them almost 30 min. to bring is our food, and again we were brought a wrong item and not the correct amount of wings. i was devastated. by the time we got the correct wings we were done eating and were quite frustrated with the service. i would not recomend this location in the future."
"definitely what you would expect from any other bww location.  yummy wings, tvs everywhere, and good fast service.this place gets really busy anytime the badgers or the packers play, but all wisconsinites are already prepared for that!"
"the last two times my daughter and i went the service was horrible! the first time being there, the food took 40 minutes to arrive at the table. all that was ordered was a medium order of wings and a kid's cheeseburger meal. the cheeseburger was cooked well over well-done and the bun was blackened from being burnt. the last time, and it's the last time i ever step foot in that place, the same was ordered; a medium size wing order and a kid's cheeseburger meal. this time it took 1hr and 18mins before the food came out. i asked for the manager, who seemed apathetic about my complaint. he said he'd remove the meal from the bill (which we refused after waiting so long anyways) but made sure that the beer and soda that we had while waiting for our food was charged. after leaving, we went to chick filet down the street which had fantastic customer service just at the drive-thru. don't waste your time at this bww location. you'd be best visiting the chick filet if you are planning on eating food."
"i have been to many buffalo wild wings, but this one for some reason was not up to standards. we spent about 50 dollars worth in food and drinks. to receive very very very cold wings and lacking any sauce. they also were very slow in their service. i called them to inform them of the situation and they told me they cannot do much for me. i am very disappointed in this location, will be going elsewhere"
"we have never had anything bad from here, the food has always been great.  the service is great also.  the servers are on top of it, you never have to wait for anything.  they are at your table when needed, not too much.  and they are always happy and chipper.  i would say 95% of the time we go there, the manager stops by to see if everything is ok.  the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the price of the beer.  i do miss the old manager, jason.  he was always so upbeat and kept the place running smooth.  but it seems like the other managers are doing the same, unlike a couple of years ago when jason went to a different store and the place got rather dirty and sloppy."
"ill rep bdubs all day. their wild sauce is hard to beat when it comes to spice and flavor. ive probably come here over 30 times, and there was only 1 time i had a bad experience. their appetizers are great and their boneless wings are some of my favorite. pro-tip, ask for your wings to be extra-wet if youre a sauce lover like me, they will load it on."
"awful management. last night, we sat down to eat, ordered wings immediately, and then proceeded to wait an hour. the place was dead.. maybe about 5 tables that i could see. after asking our server if we could just have an appetizer to snack on... he snapped back that he was busy with his larger party. he then said there was a ""delay"" in the kitchen and that  nothing was made. ummmm... ok how about an apology that we have been sitting here for an hour watching you run around the table of 15 right next to us. who by the way, ordered, ate, and paid  before we ever even had our server check on us. (wtf). he was a nice guy, and i felt bad for him that he obviously couldn't handle it or ask a manager to help.after an hour of nobody helping us, we got up and left. nobody said a thing. where were the managers? why did something this unprofessional happen? i don't recommend here if you're going late at night because it seems like they have no manager on duty. awful!"
sitting here at the bar and the bartender has at least 5 hickies on her neck how discussing. spoke with the manager and did not seem to care.
"let me begin by saying that bwws is, in general, one of my all time favorite places to dine. that said, the bww in oak creek is very hit or miss with its service. that alone brings my normally 5 star rating down to a 3. cons: a few examples include servers who take 10+ minutes to come to a table to even serve you water, managers who are unable (i.e. likely able but just plain rude) to assist when there's a complaint about the food, and consistently screwing up the order your food is supposed to come in. every single time i've dined here and ordered an appetizer, it's come out with the food or after the entree food. this has gotten to the point now where we need deliberately order appetizers a good 15 minute before even putting in for our entrees. the nature of dining out should be easy, and relaxed. this bww location simply makes that a tall task, as you as the customer have shoes to fill right once you walk in if you're looking for a normal and pleasant experience. going here and playing the ""i'm going to gamble on my service"" game is super frustrating, which is why we have had to resort to super deliberate tipping at this location. pros: food options and food quality - almost always consistent and delicious. // multiple tvs for sports games draw in crowds of sports fans, making dining here during big games exciting. // jason is one manager who does it right, offering comps if there is a true mix-up on the end of service or food."
"the food quality was average, and exactly what i would expect from a national chain. i would suggest skipping the appetizers, they will almost always arrive the same time as the entree. the wait staff seamed over worked and disconnected, they were slow to help tables.  this place is not bad for just a few drinks with friends, but you might want to take your squad somewhere else for a quality meal."
"i will never step foot in this place again. literally the most unprofessional host/hostess staff and manager (zachary) i have ever seen. we put our name down and she didn't even tell us how long of a wait so i asked and she said ""probably a half hour"". so we waited the half hour and they were basically whispering the names so my fiancé checked if she had said our name and she said no. maybe 5 minutes later they started seating people that came in after us. my fiancé asked why they were being seated before us and they said ""we called your name once"". the entire host staff were clearly teenagers and tried to seat their friends that came in first so made no attempt to seat us in the correct order. the host even slapped hands with the guy he sat before us that came in after us. we were so annoyed and i wanted to talk to the manager. he went to talk to the host staff and said ""well they called you three times."" umm really because we were literally sitting two people away from the host desk. he then said ""well i wasn't here."" what a joke. good luck with the awful manager and awful host staff! you're doing a great job! not!"
"terrible service took 30 plus minutes to get wings, when place was completely empty. by the time we got our wings they were cold and i waitress avoided coming back to our table. i say save your money go to coaches for better wings same price."
"i would like to write a comment about your staff at the oak creek, wisconsin location for an outstanding performance. we were greeted in a friendly manner and service was outstanding! our server zachary was very attentive and very courteous to our needs at this location. also, i wanted to mention lisa for an awesome job in locating my lost wallet along with her staff at this location. they were prompt and i could only imagine if it wasn't for your staff for being so kind and courteous how today would have turned out. i would like to say thank you guys so much for the great service and job well done! i'll definately recommend this location to my friends and family in the area. again thanks a lot!"
what can i say its bw3's. the wings could be bigger but i always enjoy there sauces. service was good and food were good.  got seated right away even thou it looked packed by parking lot.  my little guy loves game pad and theres always a good game for me to watch.
"sometimes people like to go out and get wings or watch a sporting event at lunch. i usually don't like coming here. this location was newly renovated about a month ago, but service issues remain. still achingly slow during lunch, even when getting the fast lunch options, and the fries are usually underdone. on the positive note they always deliver split checks and are almost overly happy to give you a soda refill. there aren't many other options for wings in the area, so i can only hope the service improves."
"went to bww before a movie. good time as usual, you know what to expect from bww. they delivered on all areas. enjoyed the tvs and great service."
"this exemplifies all the reasons why i don't generally like chains and this chain (despite its ohio roots) has become an also ran in the over populated wing space. on this visit, i was pleasantly surprised to see a fresh lime juice margarita on the glossy printed menu. despite my skepticism, i ordered it. i watch eagerly as bottled sweet and sour, orange juice, and grand mariner were added to my 'fresh lime juice' margarita. when inquiring with the less than friendly bartender, i was promptly handed the incorrectly printed recipe slip and told 'see, this is how it's made"".  i then said, ""see, this is what your menu says"". which elicited a 'not sure what to tell you type response' and an offer for something else. i got a beer. unfortunately, the tap beer was the highlight of the experience. the chicken wrap was less than replete with anything other than lettuce and dressing. there are plenty of other local options within 5 minutes. you've been warned."
"busy saturday night.  took about 15 minutes for our server to come to our table.  after that things went smoother.  had fried pickles, and the best onion rings around to start, along with what turned out to be an absolutely fabulous captain crunch shake- it must be tried by everyone!  my daughter had the california chicken sandwich.  she's a picky eater and devoured it!  we had a large order of traditional wings with three sauces.  it was good.  i've always felt the wings are overpriced for what you get, however they are good.  when it's busy it is really really loud in there.  i think it's a good place for the variety in menu items and sauces for the wings."
"super friendly staff. which us always a plus! who doesn't love a smileing face? enjoyed the music, it is a young style genre, but is not to loud which means it is easy to listen to, for me anyway. wings were most excellent. i like that carrots and celery were an option as well as blue cheese or ranch.....some flavors in my opinion are better with blue cheese and some are better with ranch. nice to have the option. descent price as well.i liked the fact they have dry rub options, which i went with this time.  enjoyed myself!"
"i've only used this location for takeout in the past, and had no big issues then. last night, i was pretty surprised when my husband, two friends, and i came in around 8:30 and the place wasn't super packed from the brewer game. a pleasant surprise, though! we didn't have to talk loud, but we still had the bar-like atmosphere. our server, michael, was awesome - he's the main reason for the high rating. he was friendly, fast, and checked on us frequently. my lemonade was delicious (and pretty!), and our food was cooked well and tasted good. i wouldn't order the french fries again, as they weren't really seasoned and weren't anything special, but we all left happy and very full. one recommendation i have for the restaurant (this location) is to reiterate to the hostesses how they're the first face a customer sees. we walked in to a hostess that looked like she didn't want to be there and was talking with another employee. not a huge deal, but also not super welcoming. overall, though, we had an enjoyable experience and i wouldn't be opposed to coming back!"
"i should have looked at reviews before stopping in. i wanted a quick burger and a beer before a meeting. got here with a 30-minute window. was going to order a beer and the burger to go to ensure i wasn't feeling rushed. sitting at the bar on a tuesday afternoon with only 2 other patrons still caused me a 5 minute wait before my order was taken. when it was taken, the bartender yelled at me from the service station over her shoulder in a very cold tone. she then has to re ask multiple times to make sure she knew which drink and size i ordered. while i was waiting for my beer another server came over and they got into a spat about whether or not an order was canceled. 10 minutes in and it hasn't even been asked as to whether or not i was getting food. i opted not to order food, finished my beer, and left. the waitresses here seem like they think they're too good to be here, yet they seem to own the place at the same time. hoping someone can step in and discuss the wonders that a strong smile and mild attentiveness can bring to an establishment. very disappointed."
"this location was quick enough for a 2pm on a friday. it was dead.... bad star number because literally, how do you cook chicken wrong when wings are your game, overcooked and cold when they arrived. the texture was terrible. i guess when the sauce is slathered on thick it can hide your cooking mistakes."
"i don't like wings, but will go if my friends or family wants to. last time i ordered a burger and let me tell you, it was literally the worst burger i've ever had in my life. half the patty was raw and half was well done and the sauce was flavorless and congealed. i ate about half of the cooked side and the fries and called it a day. lesson learned- don't order a burger from a wing joint!"
"terrible!  we were sat with menus that were sticky, and mine was missing the specials flyer.  we waited over ten minutes with nary a look from any server or even even busser.  seemed any available waitstaff was too busy jaw jacking with their friends to be bothered with customers.  so, after a few more minutes, we decided to head across the street to quaker steak & lube.  on the way out, we noticed the hostess, who'd sat us about 12-13 minutes earlier, was also too busy chatting it up her group of friends to even inquire as to why we'd be leaving. so for at least this location, good riddance."
"there is very little here for people who dont eat any animal products. i was lied to about their black bean burger by my server, thus lead to me feeling sick during the end of my visit. only good thing was that they play the ufc, i would never go otherwise. they are getting 2 stars not just 1 because the manager assisting in finding my iphone that was lost during my time there.if you dont eat animal products dont go to bww."
nice buffalo wild wings. clean and orderly.good and fast service. the waitress was very kind and helpful. i love the mild boneless wings. i tried the cheese curds for this time and they were amazing.
"it's your slightly better than average bw3 experience.  it seems the staff here is better than most local bw3's and the restaurant seems clean as well. food is on par with other bw3's in the area as well.  i like the parmesian garlic sauce as well as the medium, and asian zing."
"my friends and i came to this location to watch the badgers game and were sat at a high top in the bar. our waitress was pretty nice overall, but you could tell she was tired and very pregnant. beer was good, so were the nachos. i was highly disappointed in my wings. (which sucks because you come here for the wings!) i ordered a small. i decided to get two types of sauces so my wings were separated six and six. half of my wings were absolutely drowning in sauce, and the other barely had any sauce on them and were dry. despite the bad wings, we all enjoyed ourselves and had a good time watching the game. we left at half time and went home. then the real trouble began. my stomach wanted nothing to do with those wings, and so i was up all night ridding them from my body. it still continues this morning.... never again i tell myself, never again."
"consistent food and service, and enjoy the place but it is really, really noisy- especially during sporting events."
worst service i have ever had. got seated and then 10 minuted later a group of teen boys got seated one table over and then had their server instantly when we hadnt had one yet. i said something to a guy that we had as a waiter before amd he got our drinks and after talking to people just decided to take care of us. he was great but it took half an hour or more to get our food amd amother twenty minutes to get our dessert. we ended up being there for 2 hours snd most of that was spent waiting.  3 tables around us that got there after us were turned over before we finished eating! we never even got a refill on our soda. we were thrown in a corner and forgotten about.
"sure, it's a big chain restaurant, but the wings can't be beat. much better than quaker steak."
"go on thursday.  get sauce on the side.  order more than one flavor.  don't want to tip...?  get it to-go!  seriously, though, on a thursday, expect bad service. it's not just this one, but it's all of them. this is one of the only places in the world where the food makes up for the service, though. granted, i haven't really tried the food other than the wings, but it's worth the chance of never trying anything again. the wings are just awesome with parm garlic and medium sauce. sweet!"
an employee was giving out samples for the new cinnamon squares that i did enjoy and said i'd probably have to order after my meal. after i ordered the cinnamon squares they told me that there weren't any thawed and ready. how dissapointing.
"pathetic, couldn't get the order right even though i only ordered boneless wings with sauce on the side. never asked if i needed anything more. wings seemed stale. need i say more. worst location i've ever been to and i've been to quite a few buffalo wild wings"
"this was my first visit to the chain, so there isn't much depth to my review.  i'll be sure to visit them again and can always adjust if necessary, but for now i like the place when it comes to bar food.i had a pulled pork sandwich with fries.  you have your choice of their sauces, so i tried a honey bbq which it turned out to have a great flavor and they didn't add so much that it over-powered the meat.  the fries were good, a little better than most places for some reason.  proportions were good, but may be a little small for a big apatite.they have a great selection of beers on tap and plenty of t.v.s.  i am not sure if sports is all they show normally, but such was the case during my visit.  i'd prefer news in the mix, but it's not a big deal.overall it's a good bet for bar food. next time i will actually sample the wings too!"
spotted cow on draft along with some bone in wings and you have yourself a nice night out.
"bw3 is always good for consistent tasting wings.  you always know what flavor you will get so 3 stars for knowing what to expect.now let's talk about service and ease of ordering from this particular location.  last week was the second time that the on-line ordering did not work and i ended up calling in the order.  it gives you a non-descript error message - ""something went wrong"".  i even had my it geeks at work review it and they couldn't figure it out.  so i ended up calling in this order at 10:37am for an 11:20am pickup.i arrive at 11:20am to pay and pickup food for my team.  i pay....watch someone behind me get my food....and wait.  i asked the manager where is my food and he tells me that traditional wings take longer to cook.  really?  you dropped the order when i arrived?  ten minutes later i walk out with my food - no wetknaps or napkins and the order of all drummies was a mix of flats and drummies.i will tell you a tip - if they still have the guarantee lunch order in 15 minutes take a big team there and order traditional wings.  the cook time is 12 minutes so it is almost impossible to get them on time.  that was another lunch experience i had a few months earlier.  hopefully they took traditional wings off the 15 minute menu for their sake because you get the entire lunch for free for everybody. i really like bw3 but this location just isn't up to my service expectations.  sorry....pick it up so next time i can order for my work team."
"if you like wings, beer and sports then this is your place.  i'm a huge fan of the desert heat traditional wings with blazin on the side.  great beer selection and plenty of other stuff on the menu to eat.  if your feeling frisky then you can do the blazin challenge (12 wings in 6 minutes). i've done it several times. my record is 2  1/2 minutes of killer hot wings.  if you don't want to be daring then try the caribbean jerk or mango habenero.  both are also great on the buffalitos."
"spent the day painting and really did not want to cook, my wife said let's go to bw3's, we haven't been there in a while.shhhh, what my wife doesn't know won't hurt me.bw3's realy hit the spot tonight, habinaro mango wings and mountain dew."
"i, along with 4 friends went to join another friend to support his team (the chiefs) after the packer victory against dallas in the divisional play-offs. got there to find a total of 8 patrons in the establishment, 2 at the bar and 6 at tables scattered about the room. upon further review we found a back room with all the chiefs fans cheering on their team.  we went to the bar, ordered a drink with the intention of going back to the back room. i had driven there and was having my first cocktail of the night after a long day of hosting the game at my bar for others. i own a local popular sports bar and as one would imagine, we were quite busy for the game. this was my chance to relax and spend time with friends. after hanging out for awhile we decided to stick around until the end of the chiefs game and decided to eat there despite prior bad dining experiences. when i went to put in my food order and order another round for everyone, i was informed by the bartender i had been ""cut-off"" by the manager. ??? when i asked why, i was told i seemed drunk when i came in. a heck of a feat for someone who hadn't drank and just drove everyone... so, when i pressed for a better explanation, i was told by the bartender that she told the manager i seemed fine (cause i was) but he said didn't matter and cut me off anyway. ok. i'm cut off. cut off from any more ordering there. any more spending, and attending. all 5 of us left with no more orders placed and no food ordered. that manager cost his bartender a bunch in tips and his business that was all but vacant any more sales. not only am i writing this review, and never going to this bw3's again, but i am also going to do everything i can to recruit that entire chiefs fan base to my bar for next season so they can see what good food and service are like. as for the long-haired assumptive, non-communicating manager who made his authority be known last night... congratulations, you protected your business from a sober driving, money spending, group bringing, generous tipping fellow bar owner. good work. next time, make the effort to talk to someone before you cut them off. fun-loving doesn't automatically mean drunk. if you had the balls to come talk to me, you would've discovered that for yourself and saved all this effort."
"have been back to bw3 multiple times in months since our experience with ana...including last night. thought i should take the time to let them know that our experiences have been much better. food was good last night and service was excellent. very attentive, quick and pleasant. i am willing to give a good review when it is deserved!"
"food is good..service is good..can do better in refilling our drinks but were courteous and attentive.for wings we love mango habanero and recently discovered asian zing, always ask for extra sauce as sometimes they may come dry.. thursday is their boneless wing special..60 cents..onion rings are good too but can be greasy...like they normally are anywhere.."
"this is your standard buffalo wild wings. we had lunch here today. buffalitos, wings and fries. the food came quickly and the managers/staff were very attentive. i recommend the spicy garlic and asian zing sauces, they never disappoint!"
horrible horrible horrible service.   everytime we try to give them 1 more shot (because we love wings) we are always disappointed.  we will not be back unless there are some big changes.   we were there for 40 minutes waiting for cheese curd and pickles apps.  took us an hour and 40 minutes to get out of there.   this should be a 45 to 60 minute meal.  this isn't fine dining! the place was less than 1/2 full with most staff just standing around.  manager stopped by our table at ask how things were.  she practically ran away.  never came back or did anything about it.  big thumbs down!
came on late on saturday night and had some food at the bar.the bartenders were friendly.wings are goodi ordred a snack size medium and buffalo chips with cheese.will be back
"so, papa murphy's apparently closes when matlock comes on so we decided to give a different bdubs this week.  after last weeks abysmal performance in new berlin, we weren't holding our breath.  i have to say that i'm quite glad we took the chance.  we were promptly seated and within a minute, we were greeted by our waitress, mackenzie.  in every way, she excelled in her duties.  when asked about the limited time mongolian sauce, not only was she informative, she offered a sample for ordering.  it's good by the way: nice spice, hint of vinegar, and barbecue...had six boneless.  i would say more about the chow, but hey...who hasn't been to bw's...  anyway, mackenzie made sure our drinks were kept full and promptly checked to see if we needed anything.  about the only complaint, hence the lack of a fifth star, would be, in case no one noticed.  it's baseball season.  lord knows we're bombarded by the basketball and the never-ending felony league coverage.  but it would be nice that with the 527 televisions in the place, more than one could have been turned to a single ballgame.  nope, we were bombarded with some drivel about some draft going on by the nba.  anyone paying attention would have noticed that not one customer was paying any mind to that nonsense.  lord knows during that insufferable football season, every tv would have had a different game on and were there not enough to fill each screen, replays of games past would be rebroadcast.  i didn't intend on spending more time griping about the broadcasts as the service was outstanding and that's really why i wanted to post about the experience.  i can say that we will be back to this location again.  even upon leaving, a waitress whose hands were full, made sure to thank us and extended an offer to return."
i have been to at least a dozen of these around the country. this one is straight garbage. least favorite of all of them. awful. takes forever to get served. food is never hot. order has been incorrect all three times i have been there. wait staff seems uninterested every time. never coming back. you suck. nothing else needs to be said.
"wings and service both were quite good... waitress was very attentive and nice. we just missed happy hour so beers were kinda pricey. but eh, still fine. i would have given five stars of the bleu cheese dressing wasn't so non-chunky"
best experience at a buffalo wild wings ever!!!  we went in for a late lunch and there was only one other couple in the restaurant.  the servers were very attentive.  the manager came over to make sure everything was going well.  the server and manager made sure our discount was taken off for staying at a nearby hotel.  the food was delicious and cooked perfectly!  the server brought extra napkins and checked in on us just when we needed it!
"i wanted to like this bw3 - i really did but i ended up not being a fan.i sat at the bar and expected decent service, like i have at other bw3s but it was lackluster. our bartender seemed more occupied with cleaning the cups and doing other random things than serving us - there was such a lag time between getting our drinks to ordering our food to getting our tab. i've gone to the one by mayfair as well as the one on s 27th st and have gotten far better service than what i have gotten here, even during times that were busy while sitting at the bar. i am not coming back - if i have to, i'm definitely avoiding sitting at the bar."
"had the jalapeño poppers for an appetizer, cheeseburger, and fties for meal. topped off with a drink, fantastic. service was fast and friendly. a great dining experience."
"there is a reason this bw3 has 2 stars and the other bw3's in the area is rated higher. i went last thursday ( $0.60 cent bonless wings) and their was hardly any sauce on the wings, actually 3 of the wings had almost no sauce on them. the buffalo chips with cheese also was very skimpy with the cheese, although the server i had made up for the lack of quality in the food. and the fact this location still serves coca-cola products (for now) was a plus.*updates*: been here twice now. both times my wings have had more sauce and the wings were cooked well. the cheese on the buffalo chips has gone up in quantity as well. still good staff. unfortunately this location has switched to pepsi products."
great service. mackenzie was a great and patient server with our 5 year old. way better than the pewaukee location. they even did a great job with my grain allergy. the manager came out with the food and asked if they made it right. just awesome. keep up the good work! see you guys soon!
"i've been here a few times and it's a-ok...not sure why it's getting 2 stars...their staff has always been friendly...they have some nice drafts...bone in wings have been what i'd expect, etc."
"i've been to bw3's periodically in many cities.  usually the food is decent, service is fine and you can watch just about any sports you'd like.  basically a reliable choice for a casual meal, and the kids like it too.  but i will never eat at this brookfield location again.  believe all the bad reviews about dismal service at this particular location!  here's what happened:5:40 - arrived with wife and 3 kids for a 9th b-day celebration.  the birthday girl chose the bw3.  it was a saturday night and restaurant had some people in it but there was no wait5:45 - polite waiter took our drink and appetizer order5:55 - cheese curds appetizers arrived.  a little greasy and portion was small but ok.  placed our dinner order6:30 - food has not arrived. flagged down waiter who said kitchen was backed up. no kidding!  restaurant was not overly busy and there was no large party in sight6:45 - waiter stopped by and apologized.  said manager would be over shortly6:50 - group behind us got their food order and they'd arrived after we did.  seems they waited quite a while too7:00 - no food, no manager.  we flagged down the manager and he said he'd look into our order7:15 - we left the restaurant hungry and went down the street to a fast food place just to feed everyoneother bw3's in the area are much better. drive there if you must get your wings fix"
spotted cow on draft along with some bone in wings and you have yourself a nice night out.
"bw3 is always good for consistent tasting wings.  you always know what flavor you will get so 3 stars for knowing what to expect.now let's talk about service and ease of ordering from this particular location.  last week was the second time that the on-line ordering did not work and i ended up calling in the order.  it gives you a non-descript error message - ""something went wrong"".  i even had my it geeks at work review it and they couldn't figure it out.  so i ended up calling in this order at 10:37am for an 11:20am pickup.i arrive at 11:20am to pay and pickup food for my team.  i pay....watch someone behind me get my food....and wait.  i asked the manager where is my food and he tells me that traditional wings take longer to cook.  really?  you dropped the order when i arrived?  ten minutes later i walk out with my food - no wetknaps or napkins and the order of all drummies was a mix of flats and drummies.i will tell you a tip - if they still have the guarantee lunch order in 15 minutes take a big team there and order traditional wings.  the cook time is 12 minutes so it is almost impossible to get them on time.  that was another lunch experience i had a few months earlier.  hopefully they took traditional wings off the 15 minute menu for their sake because you get the entire lunch for free for everybody. i really like bw3 but this location just isn't up to my service expectations.  sorry....pick it up so next time i can order for my work team."

awesome service and great rewards program!!  always friendly service and normally pretty fast too!
"if you're eating in, this is just a regular, mediocre run of the mill bw3. if you order delivery from this location, you're in trouble. last 4 orders in a row have been missing items or wrong items all together. i once ordered extra blue cheese and got ranch (which had leaked allover the order, and i hate ranch) tonight i ordered 3 items. 3. and they forgot one of the items. i would be more understanding if it was 20 items and 1 thing was missing, but apparently these buffoons can't count to 3. ironically, they actually attach the receipt to the bag with a sticker that claims the order was checked for accuracy  (obviously not) and napkins and utensils were included (they weren't) not suprisingly the sticker has a place to for an employee to sign off on, that was left blank. absolute morons working here. will never order again. i recently read a article saying bw3 is struggling financially. when you can't successfully fill a 3 item order, there's little wonder why."
"i do not expect a 5 star meal when going to a major chain bar/ restaurant but i do expect some quality. i got my food to go, and when i get it home and open it they mixed up putting the seasoning on my fries instead of my chicken. ok no big deal i guess i can eat plain chicken and chipotle bbq fries. my first fry had a nice long hair on it. ok its probably a one off incident. nope i grab fry number two and a long hair is cooked into the thing (picture included). i paid almost 50 dollars for all of this food, and had to heat it up when i got home from my 10 minute drive, and got to eat the chefs hair. not all of their restaurants are like this, but the west allis location is sub par from customer service to quality."
"fun sports bar! i came here to watch the bucks' playoff game. oh, the brewers were playing too. i sat at the bar, where i had a great view of the 2 giant projection screens on the wall behind the bar. the brewers game was on one, and the bucks game was on the other. the collective energy in this place was awesome! milwaukee sports fans coming together to cheer on our teams, high-fiving each other as if we're old friends. we arrived in time for happy hour and enjoyed $1.50 off tap beers and $4 appetizers. we tried the street tacos and roasted garlic mushrooms. the mushrooms were pretty boring: just your garden variety breaded mushrooms. the street tacos were decent. there were 3 flour tortillas filled with chicken, pico de gallo, cilantro and southwest ranch dressing. of course, we had to order wings too. i mean, the place has ""wings"" in it's name. it happened to be a tuesday, which means half-priced traditional wings. they offer 16 different sauces and 5 dry rubs to dress your wings. we opted for a few of the sauces: mild, spicy garlic, asian zing and hot bbq. all were good, but i especially liked the asian zing. i was really impressed with the service at the bar. it was a busy night, with the bucks & brewers games to watch. i was surprised there was only one bartender working. every seat at the bar was filled, plus the bartender had to make all the drinks for the waitstaff. this girl was good! she was working hard and totally pulled it off. we never had to wait long for refills, and she kept smiling."
"always great service. i have come in multiple times to do some studying and they've been great at accommodating my request of an outlet. this time, they didn't have a table close enough to an outlet. i offered to wait,  but they said it was ok and brought out an extension cord."
"bad experience all around! my friends and i went there around 7pm on a weekday, not busy at all. we first waited for 50 minutes for our food, any that's not the worst part yet. both my friends food were cold, and i got a freaking fly on the wings i ordered! how disgusting! will never go back. not recommend!!"
"stopped into the west allis location tonight, tuesday, around 7pm.sat at the bar and had a lemonade, some wings, and buffalo chips with cheese.started off with a mango lemonade - very good!bartender was chatty and friendly while i waited for my food.i order the snack size of boneless wings which is plenty large for 1 person - prolly 7-8 wings.  i mide the mistake of ordering mild - too bland.  make sure to at least order medium if you want them a little hot.ordered another lemonade - this time, tried the huckelberry, it was good, but not as good as the mango.bill was around $15.25 for the wings, buffalo chips, and lemonade."
i'd give zero stars but it won't let me. we have been waiting 20 mins for our food. we are lucky if our server even comes to the table. we had to eat our appetizer off the table because our server fails to pre set her table. never coming back again . this place needs mangers to be out table touching but instead u r lucky if u see a manager . what a shame .
"if i could leave zero stars, i would.  my husband and i both got food poisoning from this location in december.  it was so bad i ended up having to go to the er for medication and fluids.  we called to let management know, and although they were very kind on the phone, the follow up was terrible.  we aren't the kind of people who are looking to make a buck, but our meal made us sick, which cost us money in medical bills and we had to take off a day of work to recover.  i was hoping at a minimum they would at least refund our meal, but we received a letter in the mail from the regional manager basically saying that the restaurant couldn't possibly have caused food poisoning because of how clean the restaurant is, and they would not do anything for us as a result.  they did, however, give us some $5 off coupons.  how generous of them.  it's incredibly disheartening to be so disregarded after being so violently ill.  i will also say that there is no way my husband and i had the stomach flu.  not only did the er confirm it was food poisoning, but we both got sick within about 15-20 minutes of each other.  that would be incredibly strange timing for a stomach virus when neither of us had been exposed to a single person with a stomach virus, my husband and i were not even around each other the entire day leading up to this illness, and our 3 month old twins who we had to take care of that night while we were both violently ill did not get sick.  the other frustrating thing is that we were told we would be contacted by the company's ""comp team"" to address our medical bill situation, and to date, no one has bothered to contact us.  thankfully, the bills were not that expensive, but i really shouldn't have to be responsible for their carelessness in handling food.  i will not go back, and i would urge management to take these issues more seriously.  i have never in my life been so sick, and i don't wish it upon my worst enemy."
"buffalo wild wings again? surprise!i thought about trying out a new place to have a few beers and play  trivia at another place instead of going to tosa or bayshore locations. stephen has a way of taking dukedoms from me, lol.  i used the yelp mobile application to get here. this location is unlike the others as it is an in line strip center* rather than a freestanding location. the staff are pleasant and polite making sure to provide good service. the beers were served in frosted glasses.  fyi these are not your basic dive bar glassware.  if you look closely there is a lazer etched logo. causing cavitation and effervescence.  they have coke products and coke zero and diet coke as an option. the layout easy in and out for take out. the bar area is clean and looks a large selection of 20 drafts to choose from. $1.00 off tall taps during happy hour. the competition was ok for buzztime trivia on a wednesday.  more of the customers were playing poker. i ended up playing along with  6-7 players, that was fun!i'd go back if i happen to be in the area to try the wings. they get busy on tuesday's and thursday's as they have special deals on wings and boneless wings.  in general buffalo wild wings are slightly smaller than many bars but the choice of 17 sauces and 3-4 dry rubs is worth it.  i usually have a bottle of mango habanero in the fridge at home.* strip center is not a strip club, sorry dude b."
"i went to bws at 12:45. they close at 1. three employees saw me but did not open the locked doors. very frustrating. i understand that you want to leave early, but to lock your doors before you close and ignore customers is bad business. i am going to call the gm tomorrow to let her know. it will be an interesting conversation"
"do not go here unless you like to overpay for crappy food and be disrespected by terrible management. i ordered to go through grubhub and was told that the wait time was 40-60 min. i ordered my food at 6:50pm and it was confirmed through the grubhub at 6:58pm. i did not receive my food until 8:30pm. my food was received cold and with an item missing. the wings were not fully sauced and my mac n cheese was barley even cheesed. i called the restaurant to ask what was taking them so long and to figure out the problem. when i called, i spoke to nathan, who told me he was a general manager. i addressed my issue with him and also to talk to them about my missing items and quality of food. he told me that the food didn't come from his store despite me having confirmation from both grubhub that it did and calling him via the number grubhub provided through their app. he used profanity at me, he offered no solution, and finally hung up on me. i ordered $50 worth of food from them and have never been so disrespected. my issue has still not been resolved."
i was eating my dinner the other night and was enjoying my wings and the music selection. i couldn't help but notice that my favorite song came on. three times in a row. i thought it was a calling from god. i couldn't have been happier until one of the employees came running out of the back yelling about how it had played too many times. nothing ruins your appetite more than that. i lost my appetite completely and could no longer eat my food. i'm highly disappointed in this restaurant. closer by chainsmokers sets the mood while eating dinner. no one wants to eat dinner while listening to a basketball game.
"when i came here, they were very busy - busier than usual when i come here. i was impressed with how quick they were with taking my order, bringing my food and checking on me."
"mumbai sauce is here pops up when you yelp this place. false. they were out of it and tried to claim every bww is too. false, mayfair rd bbw served me it the night before. i don't appreciate that kind of service. as we are leaving: all of west allis fire department came flying into this place. bottom line: bad news at this location"
"i really enjoy this place. not only can you drink with your kids there , but they cater to the family feedings. additionally, their are 30 different beers on tap. so if you want to try them all you will have to come for a whole month. wow, a month of drinking! i'm in! happy eating and happy drinking!"
love that i can get redds on tap here! this location never fails whether i dine in or carry out!!
i really like this place and normally the service is good but i stopped here to eat lunch with my wife on 11/20 and did not have a good experience. last time we came here the waiter spilled our drinks all over the table. well nothing major like that happened this time. atmosphere: all of them look the same. tv's everywhere showing sports so it's cool. the place is clean and so are the bathrooms. service: it's hit or miss. i think they hired a bunch of new people. sometimes the food takes way too long even when the place is empty and the bartenders take forever to make drinks. our waiter was having a off day getting our order wrong and taking a very long time to get us our drinks. food: traditional wings are the only reason i keep coming here. mango habenero is hands down the best sauce. many of mild sauces are not good. the dry rub spices are not good either. get any sauce from spicy bbq and up is my recommendation. we got two lunch specials (cheeseburger sliders and wings)  they were both great. the burgers are juicy and flavorful. i ordered a strawberry margarita and it was bad. very watered down and didn't taste like strawberries. i asked the waiter to bring me a beer instead and he apologized. overall: we only keep coming back because of the mango habenero wings. the service is progressively slipping but the food is always consistently good.
"let's face it, the fry cook at any given bw3's is never going to win a james beard award, but i don't think they have any illusions about that , so that makes is ok. i find it very difficult to write reviews for national chains. their whole purpose is to make the tgi mcfunster's in cedar rapids the same as the one in spokane. again, that's ok. its what they do. this is not my regular jam. we came here for a fantasy football draft party (my first, just shoot me). my first impression was that this place is a bigger sausage party than the sheboygan brat days festival. what sucked: they had a special for ffl parties: 75 wings, 5l keg of beer for $100.00. it worked out to be about 2 beers and 7 wings for about $10.00 per person (10 people). what i didn't like was that we had to get all of the wings in the same spice level. that sucked. we would have been better off ordering smaller orders so we could pick and choose what we wanted. 2 stars for the food ""special"" what didn't suck: the service. we constantly had a server checking in with us. she rocked. i apologize for not noticing her name. the manager even came over while we were setting up to make sure we had everything we needed. they were even smart enough  not to sit other patrons anywhere near us. good move. we appreciate that, and so did he other diners. what really sucked: the noise level. this place is loud. i mean really loud. our commish thought it would be a good idea to have it hear so he didn't have to host another ffl part and piss his wife, but next year he will take the risk. what was cool: free wi-fiwhat was meh: the food. we only had various appies and a butt-load of ""medium spicy"" wings. i'll admit it, i'm a wimp, i can't handle the heat. i was not alone here. there were defiantly a few thousand scollville units hotter than ""medium."" what was questionable: why do they call them ""wings?"" they are boneless, which is awesome, but just call them what they are: mcnuggets. overall, very predictable, but if that's what you're going for, you won't be disappointed."
"i normally go here for all the ufc fight nights, but after this past experience that might change. arrived just after 6 and after being seated, requested to be put in a booth for better view and comfort. after the move, waited 27 minutes for our new server before telling the hostess and she sent over someone. it turned out to be miscommunication about who had the table, so the manager came over said sorry and said he would comp the two appetizers that we just ordered.so the night went on, with good service, until i ordered a veggie boat and it took us calling over the waitress after 45 minutes of waiting on this for her to find out the food was brought to the wrong table and to bring us a simple veggie boat. the service for the drinks was fine and our waitress kept up with our needs most of the time. onto the foodthe mushrooms that cost about 6 dollars on the menu came out in a nice big basket, but only had 11 mushrooms in it. which is nothing like what it used to be, or what i expect for 6 dollars. same with the french fries, i ordered a basket and got a small amount. the burger was good, and spiced well. veggie boat was what i expected.when the bill came at the end of the night, it turns out the manager never did comp the food he had promised and a simple beer cost me 6.50. this is far and away the worst experience i have ever had at a restaurant in terms of service and follow through. it would be one star but the food was decent tasting overall. i plan on finding a new place to watch the fights at and don't plan to ever go back."
"having been here before and other bw3 locations, i was a bit surprised at how poorly this location is now run. we were seated quickly but that is where the end of the good service ends...first, it took our server more than 20 minutes to take just our drink order.  while my friend and i were just chatting anyways, we did begin to wonder if the server would be by to take our order. after i got up to go to the bar to order, she walked by and said she'd be right over.  she did apologize for the delay as she was the only one in the bar area and since we were there for the game, i wasn't that upset although not impressed either. we didn't get to place our food order for yet another 20 minutes and again, i had to get up and signal that we were ready to order. when we received the food, we didn't have utensils, napkins, ketchup, etc.  i asked the guy who brought our food for ketchup and he returned within a few minutes but because we didn't notice we were missing utensils and napkins, i requested those as well and he never returned.  our server did stop by a few minutes later so we asked her and she brought them over right away.  the food itself was marginal but i suppose the $5 game special isn't meant to be the best food they have to offer (my friend bit into a small piece of bone in her burger). the server didn't return after that to see if we wanted more drinks or anything. we were there for an entire football game and had only two drinks each but because our server wasn't there when we would've ordered more. i wish i could blame a packed bar now but only 3 tables were left after the 2nd quarter due to how poorly the packers were playing that night. most of the employees were standing around in the bar watching tv and i tried to get the attention with what appeared to be the supervisors for service but they remained standing where they were. we asked for our checks (separate checks, which arrived 10 minutes later), noticed the errors on each, paid the bills (and each other for difference due to the errors) and left. my friend who is more laid back than me - and i was pretty relaxed - even mentioned that the service was bad.needless to say, i'll be choosing a different bw3's in the future."
food is consistent and pretty good. hence the 2 stars. service is awful. the only way you will get anything is flagging down your server repeatedly. otherwise it will be assumed you don't need refills on drinks or dessert or anything except to occupy the table. i love the food and drink selection but will avoid this location.
"the two stars are for the food since it's always consistently good, or else there would be no stars. the service is always horrible, it took us 10 minutes to get a server to even look at us, and then she didn't bring our drinks, and when she did, the blended one was melted and watered down. we got spinach and artichoke dip which was good, too bad the chips were ridiculously stale, and the dip wasn't even hot anymore. disappointing. i don't know why i pay money to come here."
"i enrolled in blazen rewards and buffalo circle. i buy $100 of holiday cards each year for last three years. i didn't get my coupon for free wings for my birthday. i called and asked manager about it and he told me..""we don't honor things from our corporate office. we have to have your email. you are out of luck if you didn't get it. we won't honor it if you don't have email. but you can continue to buy our holiday cards and come eat here.""     so you can spend money there but when it comes to honoring your birthday treat, they don't honor it. why should i spend money there and get turned away when rewards are due?"
"always good service here. but i only sit at the bar, so it's always quick. they also change the tvs quickly upon request.  elisa is a great bartendress."
i'm not sure where to begin with this poorly run restaurant. i'll start with the 15mins it took just to get a glass of water from the bar. i would have picked up and gone elsewhere if it wasn't for my friend visiting out of town.  next my table of 5 finally shows up but it takes 2 and half hours for one of the 10 waitresses to push two table together. our waitress never stopped at our table to refill drinks or ask how we were doing. we got to the point where we order two drinks each and our food all at once knowing it would take 30mins or more. mind you this is a very slow evening. the staff here seems more concerned about chatting with each other and resting their heads on the table than serving guests!
i called in an order for takeout on a tuesday (half off traditional day) so i figured it would be a little busy. i got to the restaurant at the time they said my order would be ready and the line for takeout orders was backed up to the entrance door. i was texting a friend throughout my wait in line so i have record of how long i waited...25 minutes in line to simply get up to the counter to pick up my wings plus a few minutes more to retrieve my order. the wings were dry and sparsely sauced. i've definitely had better experiences at bww's before and i've ordered takeout from this location a few times before but this location just doesn't ever seem to very good.
"first time here, the projection tvs kinda suck, takes some getting use too. our waitress tanya has been super fast and friendly. food was good, fries served cold and not very tasty, after telling tanya this she was quick to ask if we wanted them replaced. bathrooms need to be cleaned up a bit... but other than that we were glad to find a place that was showing the fights."
horrible! no one ever greeted us so we decided to just sit at a high top in the bar area. 5 servers walked by....not even eye contact was made. a couple was seated 2 tables away after about 10 minutes of sitting there. a server eventually went to their table yet completely ignored the 4 of us. we left. there were 3 tables occupied in the whole bar area with another 4 tables dirty with garbage. dirty establishment with piss poor customer service. zero friendliness which ranks this bww lower than the applebee's across the way. didn't think that was possible.  congrats bww you managed to hit rock bottom!
very bad run restaurant with terrible customer service- host  left us standing for 15 mins - never even greeted us. waitress informed me that they were busy and it would be a 20 min wait. bad service and rude host has become the normal at the place
"it was my birthday. my friends were coming over for some pizza and netflix. i suddenly wanted wings and the love of my life offered to pay. thus, bringing me to bww. i ordered from work online, to be picked up when i got off. my co-worker was allll like, ""what if they make it early and then it just sits there?"" i was like, noooo, they wouldn't....right?!? but then i just sat there, getting more paranoid as time went on. i'd be so pissed if i pick up my wings and they weren't fresh. so i decided to call. they said that when you order online, the system doesn't kick the order to the kitchen until 20 minutes before your pick-up time. phew! thank goodness. also, the hostess on the phone was friendly. i get there at 6:30 and my wings aren't ready. but i ain't even mad about it because i'm just glad they're the freshest! we did order a lot of wings. when the wings were finally done, the manger brings out the wings and shows you what's in each box to make sure they're to your liking. after looking at my receipt and paying i realized it was crazy busy because of half-priced wings on tuesdays. yay for my bill considering the $44 worth of wings that we got would have been over $50. so worth it! these wings were bomb! cooked to perfection and sauced how i asked. did you know that you can request drumstick or flat wing only?! i got one small order of only drumsticks. no regrets. i love the flats too though, so i wanted a mixture in my other selections. great deal of sauce options. this specific location was packed, but service was really friendly. we get wings maybe once a year, so next year when we do, we'll for sure be back to this one!! this place is a part of bayshore mall. i parked right quick at tj's because i knew i wouldn't be long, but i'm not really sure on parking situations otherwise. there's a parking garage right next to b-dubs and near five guys, but i've never been inside. it seems i wasn't the only one to park at tj's and walk over. but beware, i've gone to tj's before when a car was getting towed, so i know they don't play sometimes...there's a sign that states that no guns are allowed on the property. uh...not sure what that is about."
they were late delivering. the food was mediocre. that's all i have to say about this review.
"so after i got sick at bww and threw up there about 8 years ago, i've hardly been back. not only that, but they got rid of my fav drink(mr pibb). strike 2. i only went today bc i had a gift card, but it was an alright experience. got to stay there for a few hrs to watch football and the food was good. idk how often i'll go back, and i'm not saying they're back in my good graces, but this is a good start. a step in the right direction for sure."
"this was a horrible experience. fortunately the servers took so long that we left before we ordered. first when we walked it it smelled horrible. there was trash all over the floors. we were seated and started by feeding our baby so that we could potentially eat with out her fussing. in the amount of time we fed her, not one person came to serve us or even give us any sort of acknowledgement. then my wife pointed out that there was a chicken wing on the floor under our table. there were servers standing around everywhere and no one came up to us. we were incredibly disappointed. i do not expect a whole lot from buffalo wild wings but i have never had service, or lack of service, this dismal."
it was a quiet thursday night. the food is enjoyable. four stars is given to the server who smiled and talked with me making my night better.
time for an update. this location is in transition.  a new gm. i only recognized two of the original group. barry the mgr and chad the bartender. plus a few of the waitstaff.   **job tip**  if anyone is looking for a job in the area? come on in. get a job application. i believe they are hiring for all positions. food about the same just learned that the portions are renamed. and portions are now done by weight.   people are turning over due to weak or no tippers.   good servers have been known to give worse service. and that sometimes reinforces the no tippers to continue. free parking in any of the two nearby structures. i'm happy that wisconsin passed an law to allow ccw issue permit. but not to happy of the sign out front restricting lawful carry.   i hope they put a ban on robbery too.  a gun free zone does not imply safe zone.   that's all i'm saying on that. food: 4ambiance: 3 still has large projection tvs and dish network or direct tv leads to frustration in bad weather. service: 3location: 4 parking ok on a bus line. value: 3  better on wing tuesdays and boneless thursday.
the manager with a pony tail is very rude and acted like we were an inconvenience to him by eating and spending our money their. our server was very nice though.
they won't let you in without id because of their policy. my fiance forgot her's so i told her to go ahead and order for me while i get her id. she comes chasing me saying that they wouldn't let her put an order in unless it's take out. what the fuck? we come back about 5 min later and then get seated. the waitress takes a while to get to our table and then tries to push us to buy more food. i told her we'd think about it and started to wait for our water which didn't even come until i reminded her about it 20 min later. our waitress had no manners. there's no sense of unity/team work within the wait staff because they wouldn't give my table water unless we ask our waitress. the other wait staff were just standing at the front doing nothing and it wasn't even busy. don't come here unless you don't mind horrendous service.
"worst food experience i've ever had. i don't expect much from buffalo wild wings in general, but this establishment should go out of business. horrible management, terrible service, and the food was disgusting. waited to be seated with over 50% open tables, our waitress was very unattentive, and our food arrived cold after 45 mins of waiting. there were straws all over the ground and even wings. just gross don't come here."
"terrible smell throughout the entire restaurant every time i've been here. the majority of the waitstaff is more caught up in conversations with one another than being attentive to their customers. expect to wait at the entrance for an awkward amount of time before being acknowledged, even when the restaurant is slow. witnessed one employee eating food in front of the customers while on the clock. food is good, consistent with the quality of other bww locations. however, service is either a hit or miss depending on your server."
"i am a bit disappointed in this buffalo wild wings. i love buffalo wild wings.. this review is in regards to the service at this location onlymy friend and i decided to get some wings to go to nurse our hangover. we happened to walk in 30 minutes before this team called the packers were playing their rival team... or something like that. : ) so of course it was busy and we had to wait 45 minutes for our wings. we didn't mind. we both needed to chat with our respective mothers. when our order was finally ready the server opened each box and showed us its contents. the wings looked delicious and we were so excited to walk out the door and ravenously devour the wings until we saw the contents of our shareable item.. the buffalo chips..the buffalo chips: there were no more than 10 in that box. we told the server of our disappointment and he acknowledged that the amount that we received was inadequate; however he said that we would have to wait another 20-30minutes for them to rectify the situation. we just waited 45 minutes, patiently, with no fuss. now you are telling me that i have to wait another 20-30 minutes for you to fix our order. no sr.... leaving now.i get you are busy.. i get that mistakes happen... however there is only so much you can ask a customer to do. things could have been easily fixed by offering us to wait while you fixed the order and offering to pay for our $5 chips or toss in a wing or two... my goodness.."
"the food was alright after all its wings and beer and you really can't screw that up. the 1 star is for the service which was awful. we ordered our food and it took almost 10 minutes to get our drinks. two people in our party needed refills on their side and no waitress was in sight. i took them to the bar only to be greeted by head shake and complete indifference to my request. food took another 30 minutes to come and another 10 minutes to get ranch dressing. the only prompt service was the bill. this has not been the first time we had awful service, but this will be the last time we go to this bw3"
"garabage this place was. waited 20 minutes to get just menus. i even seen 3 out of 3 rounds of a ufc fight finish before the menus came. just got up and left. horrible staff, needs suffer training."
literally the absolute worst. everything takes at least an hour to get to the table and don't even think about ordering to go. you will wait another 2 hours. the absolute worst buffalo wild wings out there.
it's a buffalo wild wings ... we've all been to one. personally i go to them when i travel to get some beer and watch the game . do people actually go to them for the wings? anyways my rating is based off this specific location. this location has some rough around the edges employees. don't come off as very friendly and they make you seem like you're bothering them as soon you step through the door. we wanted to sit in the dining room and they wanted to cram us in the bar area. when we asked to go to the right to the dining room she looked at us and said she had to check to see if there were tables available ... it was like a snl skit. you could clearly see the place was empty and there were only three tables ( parties of 2-4 people)... was she serious? maybe explains why the place was empty on a huge college football night . during our dining experience we were never really checked back on. we constantly had to flag her down to get refills on our drinks ... and they were just water and sodas ... it's not like they were mixed drinks that's needed to be made. she never asked if we wanted ranch or blue cheese so she brought out all ranch . when i asked to have sauce on the side for my naked tenders she said i could only have one and i said cant i pay for more sauce cups? i guess when you order the 6 naked tenders you're only allowed one sauce cup at this location. save your money and go somewhere else.
"service was terrible. we ordered drinks and did not receive the drink orders for over 15mins. when we finally saw our waitress again to take our order it took another 40mins for our food and it was brought out incorrectly. also took another 20mins for waitress to bring out the checks. throughout the night we order drinks and there were multiple misunderstandings, drinks bought out twice, drinks to wrong tables, not getting drinks we ordered. food was good overall. not sure if they werw under staffed but service was terrible."
"dined in here at 12 am friday for food and drinks. ordered medium wings + beer and specifically specified requested the waitress that make sure the wings aren't served cold. as expected, the wings were super cold just dipped in sauce. absolutely inedible. i was really disappointed as i was really very hungry. the server did not even give me napkins or serve celery and ranch with the wings. in my previous visit to the other location the server had even given wet towels to wipe the face and hands as when you eat wings the hands get really messy. ended up paying $24 for one person for cold inedible food. total disappointment as a wings fan :("
"had food delivered via grubhub. most of our order was not correct. called grubhub who then called the restaurant. in an attempt to lie, the restaurant advised to grubhub the exact packaging of the order and what was in the order. only problem... the order they described was not ours.."
"i never write yelp reviews but the service was so horrendous i've finally been compelled to do so. i understand this place is one step above a fast food joint so i don't have the highest expectations but it's decent wings and *usually* the service is decent. upfront-- the food was fine so this review is 100% about the service we got. if it was possible, i'd give it zero stars.my husband, his parents, and i went here for dinner on 6/20/17. we arrived at 6:15 and were there for 90 minutes...not by choice.roshonda, our waitress, brought out the two beers my in laws ordered and they informed her neither was what they ordered. my husband and i arrived a few minutes later and waited about 5 minutes before she came back. she returned with the correct beers and took our order (10 minutes after the original order). after we ordered our food and drinks, she said that she couldn't read what she wrote down and we had to repeat our order. it was another 5+ minutes before we got our drinks and we could see my husband's beer sitting on the bar for several minutes...apparently my club soda order was too much. we ordered the cheese sticks and soft pretzels as appetizers. the cheese sticks were average but our soft pretzels were burned dark brown and totally inedible. it was another 5+ minutes of trying to find our waitress to tell her the food was burned. she told us she needed the manager to deal with our issue so she left for another few minutes to get the manager. he told us he would correct the issue and get us new soft pretzels. the pretzels came out with our food and were decent. the food was decent, nothing above and beyond, but what i'd expect from a place like this. i could have done without the fruit flies that were everywhere in the bar area...it took forever to get drink refills and our waitress was totally inefficient. for example, my husband and i both asked for drink refills. roshonda took my empty glass but left my husband's empty beer bottle. what's the thinking in that?? it took halfway through our meal to get the extra napkins we asked for and when we did, roshonda tossed them at our table as she walked by.roshonda spent a lot of time in the back or talking with other tables around us. when we got the bill we saw that we had been charged twice for the soft pretzels. after waiting for several minutes for roshonda to come back, my mil waved down another waiter and told them we needed to speak to the manager. after waiting again (over 5 minutes), the manager said it was a mistake and took the bill to correct it. it took 15 minutes to pay our will with all the waiting! on our way out, the manager asked my mother in law how our service was. she responded that our service was slow, unacceptable, and we would not be back. he then turned to me and said that he would have comped someone else the pretzels if he knew she was going to say something like that. are you serious???as frustrating as our service was, i believe this falls on management to handle. clearly this level of 'service' is acceptable here and honest feedback is not welcomed (even when openly solicited). i'll take my money elsewhere.also, my husband said the men's room was absolutely filthy with water (hopefully) all over the floor."
"from where i live, this is where my orders comes from when i order door dash and i honestly regret ordering it every time. today, i ordered nachos with the cheese on the side. the only thing they got right was the cheese on the side. every chip in the box looked like it had been stepped on, i had to pick up the chips and toppings with a spoon to eat it. i asked for extra pico, barely got any. and my favorite part of nachos is jalapeños and i didn't get a single one. oh and we also ordered a sampler with 6 boneless wings and got 5. we honestly don't visit this particular location cause of how bad the service is- it honestly makes me cringe thinking about it. but now i will never order it from door dash either. i will never blame door dash as they pick up the food, not prepare it but no both are losing my business. this location puts the chain to shame!!!"
"i'm super confused by this place. i'm used to a bww with tons of large screen tvs, solid service, and good wings. this one seems to be lacking all those things. the place is basically a house converted into a bww with a handful of tvs. really weird design. service was incredibly slow, and the wings were not what i'm used to. i won't be going out of my way to come back."
called in an order for takeout on sunday night 10/1 at 5:40 pm and was told it would be 20-25 minutes. i got there and paid by 6:12. i did not receive my order until 6:37 pm. i waited almost a full hour for our food and i only got a simple apology. the two times previously that i had ordered over the phone my order was messed up and i had to make a second trip to get the correct food. i don't know why the service is so bad at this location but it's unacceptable. it wasn't even busy yesterday which made it that much worse.
very bad service no joke when u read other reviews. i was sat down twice and i wait for over 10 min. for any service at all. service is very bad. choose another restraunt in the area this one is not worth it.no service when i was sat down at all finally after two times of sitting  down i went to the bar to get service.
"incompetent people. disrespectful staff. only open till 6:00 for anyone under 21. went with my boyfriend who is 21, and we couldn't dine in because i had to be accompanied by someone who was ""25 or older"" and was a legal parent or guardian. seriously? no wonder the place is dead as can be. won't be going there ever again. will happily make the drive out to brookfield or menomonee falls locations which have impeccable service."
"i have always had good experiences here - for what it is. i went around 11:30 on saturday when i was craving some deep fried salty goodness. our server ericka was very attentive and sweet, offering refills when needed. she even brought out samples of the three new sauces (sea salted caramel, margarita, and ghost pepper) for us to hesitantly check out. i couldn't believe that i honestly enjoyed all three! i've had all sorts of wings, appetizers, and drinks. the food is consistent, even though the service isn't always.come earlier on (never over a lunchbreak!) and enjoy your wings in style."
this is the third strike for the bdubs... over 10 minutes to get a server and 20 minutes to get my lunch almost an hour here for a lunch... never came back to refill my tea or check on me... three times in a row terrible service won't be back to this one ever...
terrible service and slowwwww!!!!  forgot our appetizer!  server was bad.  will never go back
the food was good but it is the worst service i have ever had at a buffalo wild wings. all the servers walk around in a daze. i had to send my server back twice for all my order and you might as well forget about getting a drink refill. she was even slow at bringing the check. the manger does not deserve the job.
"worst service ever. the servers are slow, forgetful and incompetent. if you want to watch a game, go somewhere they care about their customers."
worst service ever. i'm disappointed. it takes a lot to spoil buffalo wild wings for me but this place did it.
"service was good, but as far as environment makes me feel like im at a chucky cheese. i love buffalo wild wings but this place is unacceptable. food on my seat,dirty table, unorganized. makes me feel like im in highschool again."
"i love buffalo wild wings, but this one in particular... the service is the worst service ever. food took about 30 mins to come out. never checked on us if we need a refill. had to wave someone down."
"as much as i greatly tried to steer the people i was with to go to sobelman's instead, i unfortunately lost that battle. so we ended up here instead, thinking in my head this is probably the best i can steer them to on a strip of chain places with ickier options(i.e. panda express, etc).for a bw3, it was okay but it wasn't as good as i was hoping it'd be. service felt a little slower than i was hoping it'd be, and the food was alright but nothing special. it was mostly dead when we came during a weekday lunch period, so no excuses for how slow the service was to my group! this location should also take a cue from better managed bw3s like village crossing in skokie, il, and better train their employees.and really, no smoking on their patio? seems like a stupid decision to do since a lot of people will want to smoke and drink outside during warmer events and if an interesting sports game is on(as some places do a patio setup where at least you can see a tv or 2 positioned to accommodate those outside), but that's just me. i just hate it that if you're going to send smokers outside the entrance and not permit patio smoking, that they don't even provide a bench to sit on outside the door to smoke. a disappointing planning decision. no i'm not expecting a tv to be positioned in that smoking area outside the entrance, but can at the absolute very least, a bench be provided there?"
"sooooos    l        o             wtook an hour just to get 6 wings, mushrooms, and buffalo chips. well it took that long for the wings and the mushrooms. they forgot the buffalo chips. yeah. not coming back. not unless the reviews get better."
this restaurant sucks ass can't even get a refill of water waited 30 minutes for a high chair all the waitresses waiters managers and people off the street seem to congregate in front of the kitchen but no food ever comes out this place is a joke time and time again i'm disappointed if you're looking for buffalo wild wings and you're hungry go to the one in oak creek don't even waste your time at this shithole
"ordered some wings for pick, and i got food poisoning about 30minutes after eating them....fml"
just spent 15 minutes waiting for someone to come to my table! no one ever showed up. mind you there was only six other tables occupied. never go here crappy service!
"frequent customer of bww but most offer far better service.  place was nearly empty at 2:00 yet our order for a table of four was brought out about 5-10 minutes apart for two people after waiting more than the 15 minutes.  one of the orders was at that point wrong.   it's not like i live around here, but if i did, i'd go to a different bww."
"i've been to many buffalo wild wings locations. never had a problem until today. i placed an order the evening prior at about 5:30pm because the timing of pick up was so important. i was picking up lunches for four of my employees and it was supposed to be a show of appreciation. pick up time was scheduled for 11:10 am. i arrived at 11:05 am. i waited for five minutes to pay, no problem. but then i started getting excuses. oh i'm sorry we had a large order before yours. i can verify this because i watched through the window into the kitchen as three female staff members repeatedly opened and closed packages of wings looking completely confused and opening sauce containers and sniffing them before labeling them. i said, 'well i placed my order yesterday online.' didn't matter. after waiting for another 10 minutes i was told that my request of extra crispy was holding it up. i again said 'i placed the order yesterday because the pick up time is very important, i have four guys who have a set lunch period from 11:30 until noon.' she told me their system doesn't recognize 'extra crispy.' i placed the order the day before. i told her at this point i was tempted to just return it because my guys were not even going to be able to eat it. she said, 'well i can refund your money.' but i frustratedly said no because then my guys would have nothing to eat. long story short i received my order at 11:25 am, (15 min late) had to fly back to work and my guys got to stuff their faces and not even enjoy their meal. the worst part is none of the employees at buffalo wild wings felt apologetic or said 'i'm sorry for the inconvenience' or anything along those lines. when the 'certified trainer' finally brought my order out she simply set it down. i asked her if that was everything and she said 'yes ma'am' without looking at me. it's just the way it is at this location, apparently. awful service. will never go back there, and judging from the other reviews on here for this location they are really dragging the buffalo wild wings name down."
"oh dear. if you ever actually get the food......it's your standard buffalo wild wings. but be prepared for a surprise sauce that you didn't order and confused looks when you ask for a missing component of your order. of all the bww's i've ever been to, this location is probably the worst."
i typically love buffalo wild wings but this one is terrible! i had to spit out 4 different boneless wings and stop eating it. the chicken quality is unpalatable.
"bw3s is a good place to watch sports and have some wings.there wings are not as good as applebees for bonelness wings, which is surprising, but true.the inside has one long dining room that often has lots of large tables of groups.  here they have booths along the wall.our server steve was very nice and attentive.i gave up soda for lent, so i had a flavored lemonade - delciious and free refills which was surprising to me."
worst customer service ever sat for over 5 minutes without a server coming to the table when it wasn't even busy. will be going to highway 100 location instead
"don't bother calling in your carry out order, they won't cook it until you show up.  be prepared for a twenty minute wait at least.the wings will be over cooked and inedible, and your order will be wrong.  save your money and go to wing stop."
"i had a bad experience- they didn't respond. i couldn't resist and took a gamble and ordered again despite that. the wings were hot- warm and delicious. idk what the heck happened the other day but i hope it was a mishap that doesn't repeat itself because i love the wings. another reason i am unhappy is the fact when you order online for carryout they make you wait like 40 minutes before bringing your food to you. in my mind if you preorder for 1pm, you should have the food ready and the customer should be out the door by 1:10pm not 1:50pm.  it's really unfortunate because the food they have is good, and to be honest i will continue to eat here despite it's shortfalls."
if i could post zero stars i would. it's thursday night i'm at the bar to watch the nlcs and packers on thursday night football. i've been sitting at the bar (in front of 3-5 employees at all times) and with a menu open and empty beer and nobody has said a word. nothing. i've been waiting for 30-40min just to order. then justin (hospitality manager) comes behind the bar to do god knows what and he doesn't say anything either. don't come here when it's busy. peoples wings are cold on arrival too.
"my friends and i just tried to eat at this location and we had a terrible and very quick experience. we walked in and got sat right away, as the place was not busy at all, maybe 7-6 tables were filled in the entire place. we sat waiting for 10 minutes without even a drink order and we watched as our waiter delivered drinks to a table that was sat after us before even greeting us. we will not be back"
"ridiculous policy of not being able to order over the phone when it's less than an hour before close, even if i'm willing to pay with my card ahead of time. always gets orders wrong anyways, don't even know why i even bother with this location. out of desperation more than anything since it's one of the few places open late in the area."
"this was our first time there. their food was good. the waitress was new (still learning the menu), but very nice, and service was fast for a friday night.  we had a combination plate of boneless and regular garlic parmesan wings that was mmmmm so good.  we had very little issues with this place. the food alone would bring us back again."
"walked in, very unwelcoming greeting, sat, waitress came with a no care attitude, rushing us. person i was with got the wrong size appetizer and when he said so, they gave him a dirty irritated look. took forever to take our orders, slacked on refills, she was the most unfriendly waitress i've ever dealt with, all the servers looked like they have that kind of attitude. worst buffalo wild wings ever."
always a great time! the hiring manager does a great job at choosing servers because i've never had a bad one. and they are great about iding i have had to go out to my car several times to get my id. food is always hot and quick!
"all i have to say is, if you're getting food to go, check your bag before you leave. you wouldn't think remember salsa for chips & salsa would be hard, or remember dressing for a salad, but it really seems to be. in addition, they don't see busy late at night but the food is never on time. i also ordered the buffalitos like i always do at bwws, and the chicken was over-cooked and extremely tough. have low expectations when ordering here."
"my co-workers and i placed a to-go order for lunch. requested it for 11:30 and showed up at 11:40 knowing it's never ready on time. still had to wait until 11:55 before it was finally ready.it's become a game with my co-workers to guess how they'll mess up the order; there's always something. this time it was an order of fries that was missing. too much of a hassle to go back for it; i called them hoping they'd refund me for it, but they refused and said i'd have to come back to the store.as for the food we did get, the wings were cold, we all lined up at the microwave to try to salvage. my special request for ""extra wet"" went ignored as most of them seemed to only have a little sauce on one side and completely dry on the other. i got a side of thai curry sauce; it was my first time trying it and i'm a fan, going to make that a regular part of the rotation.slow service, little attempt to rectify their mistake, and cold food. of course their sauces are always amazing; the only reason i still go there and the only thing preventing it from a 1-star review."
still waiting for my to-go order. employees are all on their phones in the front and back of restaurant and it's been over 25 min.also waited 4 min for someone to actually take my order because they were all on the phones in the back.
the wings were good. nothing bad about the food but the service was so slow. we went around 9pm and we knew right away it was going to be slow service. so after we got our menus we waited for a while for her to come back to see if we were ready..  so we ordered our food as soon as our server came back. maybe it was the server but she didn't check up on how we were doing or fill our waters. i had to flag her down and ask.
"as far as bdubs goes, this one is pretty bad. the food is similar to other locations but i have never had good service at this location."
"it's always difficult to review chain restaurants because lets be real this is a bww and they serve the same food as all of the other locations. which is why i will write the review on the location itself and service. this location is not the best only because there is a lack of parking being on water st. and no major lots near by. the service can be pretty hit or miss. particularly if you are doing takeout it the timing is generally off and is really slow. overall, if you want bww you will get what you order but be ready to park far away and have subpar service."
some of the worst and slowest service in downtown milwaukee.. in fact i can't believe they are still open. everytime i have been here the staff is so rude and they act like they're so busy even though there is hardly anyone in the building (maybe 2 tables at max). i've never had a pleasant experience here and the food takes awhile to come out too. i love bdubs but not this location!
"my friends and i went here to grab some food and beer after the bucks game. they were not busy at all and we were seated right away.we were sat in the back corner next to a bunch of boxes, while there were many open booths in the restaurant.we waited for about 15 minutes for our server to greet us. they never showed up, not sure why.our bartender looked very unhappy to be there. my nachos and they were cold and arrived at the same time as my wings, which had barley any sauce on them.paying our bill took over 30 minutes because the bartender was no where to be found.i will not being going back to this buffalo wild wings."
"i have been to this location several times, always receiving below average service. the food is good and i come to watch sports, but my last visit was extremely disappointing. we were sat down and didn't have anyone come get our drink order. after 20 minutes, i approached a waitress busting a table and she told us that we were at in a closed section, so nobody came to our table. i tried ordering after being there over 30 minutes and was told the grills were turned off and i couldn't get a burger. the manager told me the grills were on when we sat down, but now it was too late to order something from the grill. there was no sympathy or offer to even acknowledge a mistake. awful customer service, poorly trained. i hope we just got the bad night crew and this isn't a full representation of how this location operates."
would give zero stars if we could. our server was upset about having a table come into her section and her scowl showed it. didn't get one single smile or any acknowledgement of our thank yous when drinks were brought out. we clearly were an inconvenience to her. when our friends food was brought nearly 45 mins later the wings were dried out and inedible and the dry rub on other order looked like it was dumped on. came in to watch the ufc fights and was only reason we stuck around. horrible experience.
"i have dined here numerous times and the only time i have good service is when i'm by myself. any group larger than 4 they say they can't handle it. the staff usually are understaffed and not very enthusiastic about it. the reason i'm writing this now is because i had to wait about an hour and half to receive drinks and food. although we did get asked for our order about three times, there were still so many errors with our food. i have been done with bdubs for over a year because of their lack of timely ness and i was only here for a graduation. i can proudly say that i will not be attending this location for a very long time. but victor our hostess who ended up helping us get their life together stayed positive during the whole two hours we were there trying to celebrate."
ordered for delivery thru app. wings were par for bw's. nothing crazy but still love my wings. there's probably better choices in milwaukee but i wasn't wanting to think about it too much and the delivery option was a nice touch.
"solid wings - requested extra crispy, they were wet and not all of them were as done as i would've liked, but overall, can't complain too much for 60 cent boneless wings. will always love the thai curry and asian zing sauces!p.s. ordered on the app to avoid crazy thursday wait times, definitely the way to go."
"i wouldn't usually bother reviewing a chain like b-dubs (sorry, annoying old habits like saying ""b-dubs"" die hard). however, this particular location is pretty lousy.i don't normally patronize b-du...buffalo wild wings, but when i have in the past, the food has at least been consistently decent. not so much at this location. i've come here a couple of times for football watch parties for my college team, and the food has been cold, and on one occasion, completely inedible. service has been on the slow side but i don't entirely hold that against the staff on a busy game day. you are guaranteed to spend too much on beer; there are never any (good) specials. this is really the most ""bleh"" of all buffalo wild wings locations i've ever visited. i'd find another location (there is no shortage of them) if you're really in a b-dubs kind of mood."
"usually i would go to a buffalo wild wings and expect a safe expectation of what was to come.. well not for this location. we were in town for a few days and went for lunch and i couldn't believe how bad the service was. at first we waited 15 mins to have a server great us and ask us for our drink order. when he finally came we just went ahead and made our drink and food order, it took us another 15 mins to get our drinks. the my food came by itself and by the time my girlfriends food came i was already done eating(which wasn't even cooked that well). and to get our check was another wait in of itself. i would advice you eating anywhere else in the world but this place!"
"a standard for wings and gameday. i would typically rank b-dubs a 3 based on their wings alone, but this location has some issues. the wing girls were nice enough and came around plenty of times, but the management of seating and groups was chaotic. not quite sure why this location draws so many large groups of kids under the age of 12, but i really don't want to hear kids screaming while i'm watching the game. i drive up to bayshore for my next craving of caribbean jerk wings."
"poorly run, rude management. ordered through grub hub today 3/30/17 and they couldn't even put my order together correctly. they actually blamed it on the delivery driver...as if he was responsible for putting my order together. so if missing some food that i order wasn't bad enough...the ""manager on duty"" hung up on me. seriously! this is the type of managers you want working for your establishment? unbelievable!"
"this isn't to buffalo wild wings direct but this is for the employees that work at this specific location i am coming all the way from los angeles and i've been eating buffalo wild wings for really really long time and i travel a lot every other location i have ever been to is always good except for this one i had the worst experience ever usually i don't go out of my way to leave a bad review but this must be heard, my order was half assed forgot many and many of things such as seasoning my fries ranch carrots and also giving me really skinny chicken wings never have i experienced this at any other location the owner must do something of these employees. i am very disappointed at the lack of work ethic of every employee that was in their front and back kitchen absolutely horrifying"
"this is a pretty unique b-dubs... never seen a set-up like this.. always packed. food is consistent with other b-dubs.. this is the 103rd b-dubs i visited in the past 10 years and of the other 102 i have never seen one set up this way ...very different.  i hate the ones with no outdoor patios, so this one does not make my top 50 list. one other thing, my beer was empty on several occasions (i was sitting at the bar) i can say this typically does not happen @ a b-dubs. so, consistency of food = 5 stars, cold bud light draft = 5 stars, service = 1 star, and atmosphere = 2 stars."
"i've always been a fan of this style of food. i was first indroduced to buffalo wild wings in iowa, while in college. since then, their menu continuously inproves, and the offerings are fantastic. this location is the most conveniently located for my typical commute. despite the convenience, i would rate this as the best restaurant in the chain. the staff is friendly, the food is dependably excellent, and the layout is both welcoming and comfortable. please, ""b-dubs,"" take a look at what is going on at this restaurant and use it as an example of how other locations should be. great job, and kudos to the staff for making this an excellent dining experience.pros: you get what you expect, but with lots of extras. it's buffalo wings, and a variety of sauces and sides. other dishes include sandwiches and the like, if you're not in the mood for the flagship offerings. equipment such as seating and counters, entertainment options, etc., are all in good clean shape.cons: there could be easier parking lot access."
"regarding visit 4/4/18.in the past, i've not been really impressed with bbw.  i hadn't been back in over a year, and thought i'd try it again with my family.  unfortunately, i was not impressed once again.the service was great, but our food was down right... eh.  mediocre, at best.we ordered the newer pretzel appetizer.  the cheese that came with it was great.  the pretzel would have been great, too.  if it wasn't for the fourteen pounds of salt that came on it.  seriously--i think there was more salt than pretzel.  see picture from my visit.i had the buffalo chicken wrap..and everything in it was barely 'ok'.  it tasted like it had been sitting out for an hour or two before being served.  bland, barely any toppings, quickly thrown together, and.. old?"
i've always thought the location was weird but it has plenty of its own parking away from the home depot. we came here for an early dinner after shopping and to our surprise they were having a special on boneless wings. i ordered the medium and they were pretty hot but a good hot. my husband got the buffalo and he said they were good. we absolutely love their deep fried picklechips which was our main reason for choosing to eat here today. we did have to wait for a minute to be greeted and seated but after that our waitress was great. they also give tablets for the kids to play games at the table which was really nice for our 5 year old while waiting on our food.
my favorite wings! best sauces and reasonable food prices make this economically awesome! it's also family friendly.
"if it were not for the atmosphere and entertainment options, bww would be out of business.  i will admit it is a very fun place to get a beer and watch a game.  my wife and i also enjoy the game options the provide while you eat.  but that is the only good of this place.the food is so mediocre it is mind blowing.  if you have ""wings"" in your name, i expect you to have at least above average wings.  i can and have made better tasting wings in my oven than you get at bww.  they are never crispy and i have never had a sauce that has impressed me.  on top of that, the ranch tastes like bottled ranch.  they are the same whether you go regular or boneless wings.  i won't go as far as to say they are bad.  if i have the choice between tysons frozen wings and bww, i'll probably choose bww.  however, the difference is not very substantial.  other than the wings, their sandwiches and the rest of the food is also nothing more than average.  they do have good appetizers, and the potatoe wedges are delicious.  stick to beers and apps unless you enjoy bad food."
"nice sports bar, really like the garlic parm sauce on wings (they do put it on heavy, which i like) if you like to eat your food warm, don't order it until you finish eating your app...as many years as i've come here, they bring your food out almost immediately after serving the app and the app is either wasted or my food gets cold...i've learned that i have to pace the servers myself...and plan on waiting to pay, the servers will bring your bill you can take a long winters nap and need a shave and a haircut by the time they return to pick it up...(slow or busy times, at least they are consistent) food is typically good."
"i haven't been to this buffalo wild wings location in a very long time. me and fiancé went during the day on a sunday and there hardly anyone there. we sat the bar and the waiter was nice but she moved too slow. she was slow serving us, slow making our drinks, slow asking us for our order. just overall slow! we were the only people at the bar and we couldn't understand why she was serving us at a slow pace. other than that the food was awesome as always."
boneless wings came dry and cold. think they were from the day before. maybe we'll stick to bone in and hope they are fresh at another location
"yesterday was my first day living in pa and the first day of hockey playoffs. we wanted to watch a non-penguins game so buffalo wild wings was the safest choice. the bar area:the place was filled with jerseys and fans braving the workday to cheer on their home team. the staff was kind enough to put the red wings game on a side tv for us. back home in tx it's hard enough getting one tv for hockey but this place was filled with hockey! bless you pa. bless you.service:there is no ""i"" in this bww's ""team""! our waitress was prompt and attentive. our food was brought out by many different team members so it was served as it came out the kitchen. food:the wings were saucy, the burger was delicious, and the buffalo chips were the cherry on top. we didn't make happy hour which was a bummer but the tall beers were a reasonable price."
"pretty good as buffalo wild wings go. very clean. good service. the wings were not dry and were very flavorful. they gave out free samples of a new beer, and i love that. not as many people here as i would expect on a tuesday night. there was a regular crew at the bar, but i expected more out-of-towners being so close to a number of hotels. it was a little hard to get to, but that could just be pittsburgh driving."
"this is going to be quick.they offer a bunch of different seasonings and sauces for their wings and celery and carrots are included at no extra charge. every time i've visited, i've had a great experience. the food is prepared well and the servers are attentive, friendly and helpful."
"was upcharged for ordering traditional instead of boneless wings. several details of our order were not correct. dressing was supposed to be on the side. food was almost cold, seemed like it was sitting for a long time before we got it.overall bland, underwhelming food. overpriced for the quality. felt sick after eating."
we came on a week night and it was packed. we grabbed the only open table in the bar. we found out it was was boneless wing 55cent night. i ordered a wrap and my hubby ordered an appetizer sampler platter. it too fifty five minutes to get our food. my order wasn't even correct. the only reason they are getting one star is because our server was extremely nice.
good food but watch what time you come in it gets packed here but other than that it's good
this is the closest buffalo wild wings to me so i do not go to another often. most of the time i get take out from here but have eaten inside a few times. i know to take a jacket because every time i eat inside it is freezing inside. however the service is typically pretty good and the food is decent. my complaint is about the take out service. it is horrible! i always sit and wait for my order for about an extra 10-15 minutes!! it is never ready by the time i arrive. even if i order it an hour before. i also always ask for well done wings and most of the time they aren't well done and are barely cooked when ordering takeout. not pleased and probably won't be back for a while.
great atmosphere but the only thing u should order are the wings and nothing more.  thier nachos suck.   i mean really.  its the easiest thing to make. it lacks good chips and the right amount of ingredients & the  hamburger are frozen patti's with a wierd texture. 3 of us order them & didn't eat them. pull pork needs help too.  so in a nut shell stick to wings.
"this was my first time in this location, and last. be sure of that. the service when you are sitting at the bar is horrible. no matter how good wings and beer are done, they are nothing without good service. i couldn't get a drink here to save my life. took forever between time i got a menu and the time they took my order. they served my dinner along side my appetizer at the same time. they also run the glass washer right next to the customers. it has the most foul sewer odor ever. just what you want when eating. even the bartender agreed with me about how it smelled. disgusting. never again for me. had to edit:i left out that i never got napkins, silverware, ketchup or salt. i ended up fending for myself off of a table nearby when i got tired of waiting."
"wow!  what great customer service. nikki was absolutely fantastic!  not only did she confirm and repeat our order back to us, and she made us a fresh pot of coffee for our lunch.  #aboveandbeyond service.  check these guys out!!!"
"came here for dinner with my parents and fiancé for lunch today. i ordered the blazing wings, my fiancé had garlic, my dad had traditional, and my mom had the salad. we also had sides of fries and macaroni and cheese.food is decent -- reasonably priced, pretty salty, a little fatty, but good ol' sports bar food. i think the location has very little to do with that. the wings aren't very saucy so you might want to ask for extra sauce on the side, if you're into saucy wings.service was very good -- the server changed the tv to the world series of poker for me, kept coming with drink refills and napkins and extra sauces without batting an eye. was also seated and waited upon quickly.overall a good meal for the price. it could be better, but for the price, it's a good value."
"the wings are well prepared and very tasty. the different varieties of sauces make it easy to taste different degrees of sauce and tastes. we ordered the large wings with four different sauces, to share. the wings were great, with the right amount of sauce. we also ordered a large onion rings, which were awesome. cooked perfectly and hot and crisp. the service provided was also excellent. as we were there around 2:30 on a friday afternoon, it was not overly crowded. as this is a sports bar, and not real busy, we really all enjoyed our meals.if you want good wings with a large choice of sauces and bone in or out, check out this location."
"fun sports bar are the words that first come to mind when i think of buffalo wild wings.they offer something for those who are into trivia games as well as those who enjoy watching sports.when ordering i layer my order because the food comes up quickly, so i often order my main course upon receiving the appetizer.garlic parmesan wings are fantastic as are their walking tacos, i don't think i've had a bad dish here."
"the wings were blah at best. a bit of sauce on the outside. the sauce was watery and soaked into the to-go container. bite into the chicken and it's tasteless. i dealt with two staff members. the hostess and one working the to-go.the hostess was welcoming. the to-go staff member seemed like she was irritated and didn't want to deal with me from the moment i stepped up to order. even had the nerve to look me up and down like she had a problem. never going there again. the staff issue is a huge turnoff. however, i have no reason to pay a restaurant for less than mediocre food. at least make it up to mediocre."
"so we stayed at hotel within walking distance and we we hungry. so we decided to walk over and have dinner. we were seated quickly. we ordered drinks and it arrived in timely manner. the server took our appetizer order, we ordered deep fried pickles. the pickle chips arrived quickly and was very tasty. the three of us ordered wings both boneless and with bone. our meals arrived just as we were finishing our pickle chips. the wings tasted mushy and without much flavor which was so disappointing. the wings had the texture as if it wasn't cooked enough. we were all hoping this wasn't true, for a restaurant that specializes in wings i expected the wings to be spectacular. we all agreed we should have gone to the texas roadhouse across the street will avoid buffalo wild wings in the future."
"no one goes to buffalo wild wings for a gourmet meal. they come for the greasy food, the spicy smothered chicken and the atmosphere. they also have a television in every place they could put a television. their drinks are amazing and the servers are super proactive. my best friend had a problem with her meal and the manager quickly took it back and replaced it. my personal fave is the honey barbecue boneless chicken and the deep fried mushrooms (who knew that was a thing). they also have a homemade pico that's pretty darn amazing. i'm glad one of these isn't near my house because the food is delicious."
"i know this isn't the restaurant where you'd expect supreme service given that it's a sports bar with a bunch of tvs, but my waitress stood a good three feet from my table and heard my order wrong and only came over three times in nearly three hours! i waited at least 35 minutes for a check and she hardly acknowledged i was alive. i like the food but this rubbed me the wrong way and i probably won't be back."
"i must disclose that i am not a fan of the 1000 tv chain experience, and this is a review of the bar area.as mentioned - tvs everywhere you look.  and people on their phones everywhere, too.  it's boisterously loud without actually being boisterous.there were several of us at a table, mostly drinking - some bar food was ordered.  the food was typical bar fare, the service was very attentive and pleasant.drink prices are high, but the location is good - across from penn center.take your wallet and your outside voice.  lip reading is a plus."
"we  have been to buffalo wild wings several times. the slow service,  and loud customers, keep me from making this a restaurant on our rotation list. the food is average at best and i have never been a fan of bar food. if you are a sports bar lover, this is the place for you. tv's everywhere you look. i think too many.  you do have a choice to eat inside or outside on the side patio to escape some of the noise.  the kids love it because they offer a play pad for their busyness wail waiting for the average tasting food. they have a good kids menu and they have no issue finding something, like the corn dogs and fries. i always get the chicken wrap, i am not a fan of greasy finger food. the choices of sauces for wings is very good.  it is hard to watch a sporting event with all the tv's and loud customers. we come because the kids enjoy the food and like the play pad. they have separated the bar and dining area but the noise factor is still there and obnoxious at times. i think it is great for those that love the sports bar experience and atmosphere as well as the bar food.  i have heard many complain about the take out. we have never ordered out and cannot comment. i do have to say each time we have visited, the bathrooms have been clean and well taken care of. i have never had a manager ask about the service or food. the servers have been friendly, but extremely slow, in taking order and receiving food."
"my boyfriend and i came for dinner on friday night before a movie. the hostess saw us to a table and watched me clean off the dirty seat with my hands while saying ""sorry."" not even offering to wipe down the table/chair. our waitress was horrible. i asked for our check and 12 minutes later she comes by and says, ""do you need anything?"" when we were clearly finished with our meals 15 minutes prior. i repeated to her that i would like our check and she shown no sense of urgency. meandered to other tables before giving us our check that i had asked for twice in a span of 20 minutes. our food was hot and i was grateful for that, but we will not be returning due to the poor quality of staff."
"this isn't a bad review ,but the server we had was not the nicest .we arrived at around 11:15 pm to bring to n a friend's birthday we ordered wings and appetizers .once it turned 12 midnight we were looking to have drinks for our friends birthday but in stead we're told that we had enough.altho we had no alcohol at all we were sober ..... i do understand they have the right to refuse service but it was very embarrassing to he told ""you have had enough when you are not drunk .it really put a damper on our celebration.wings are so delicious everytime we come but this time is  we felt very insulated . shame on you !!!"
check your order before you leave. they are not very good with communication skills. if i did not look at my receipt i would have been screwed. poor service skills.
"good food and a friendly staff...good place to stop if you want decent fare at a good price. the place is a chain, so it's formulaic, but they have a good formula and it works."
"tried to be like my sister and order medium wings!! bad idea!! i can't even eat hot cheetos but at least i tried. had i gotten appropriate wings for myself, i'm sure i would have enjoyed them. after getting coast the heat, the wings were cooked well.  it included carrots and celery which help!!!  the manager and our waitress micah was extremely nice.  they provided great customer service.  i like the bar atmosphere... nice place to hang with friends and/or watch the games.  it makes me want to get into sports!  tuesday is wing day!!!"
dope ... place to come for wings and watch the game the staff are nice too.. bring some friends and watch the games so check this out my yelpers...
"i've tried it a few times. slow service, loud customers, lousy food. for a better experience try sheetz next door."
"extremely slow & unfriendly service, long wait for cold food."
"wings were well done, seasoned to perfection, and came with just enough ranch dressing to soothe our taste buds; we had the asian zing flavored wings. the salsa and chips were fresh (appetizer), and the serving size enough for at least a few to share with no problem."
"we dont eat at bww too often, but we usually have a good experience, and this was no exception.  i happen to love bww, but my husband, not so much, so when he suggested we eat there for dinner one night i was like ""hurry before you change your mind!"" :)  anyway, our server was totally on point.  she had a really friendly, outgoing personality and her service was awesome.  my husband and i were both impressed with her.  there was also a guy going around running drinks, offering samples, etc.. i forget what he told us his title was but he got us to sign up for there emails and he did a really good job suggesting different drinks and helping us out.  at first we were a little confused because he brought the first beer sample to our table and we assumed he was the bartender because he asked us if we wanted to try something else, and when he brought that sample, we told him which we preferred and he told us we had to tell our server, which we didnt understand at first, but then he continued to tell us what his job was there.  ok, but maybe still just go tell our server.. it just made for a confusing, awkward 30 seconds or so.  regardless, we finally got it and he was a really nice, helpful guy.  our food was, in my opinion, awesome as always.  i almost always get the 10 boneless wings with 2 different sauces, celery and carrots.. pretty basic and i dont go crazy with new sauces.  in that aspect, i'm a creature of habit.. i know what i like! the hubs got whatever sandwhich they were featuring and he wasnt inlove with it, but then, he's hard to impress.  he liked it enough not to complain and he wasn't upset, he just wont be ordering it next time we eat there (lord willing, haha)."
"this became the venue of choice because we wanted to watch world cup soccer.  they do have quite the selection of tvs to watch; that's for certain.i'm just not all that into the food selection of messy wings and fried ""stuff"" without other options being available that at least get my attention.i poured over the menu for quite some time before landing on popcorn shrimp and slaw instead of fries.  that should do it, i thought.  ugh... not to be so.  the shrimp didn't resemble shrimp anymore after they deep fried it to death and then some.  i didn't mean to complain to my server but she asked.  so, i honestly said i didn't like them.  she said no problem; she'd get the manager.  he came over and handled if very well.  he very cordially offered to get me something else, to which i said very politely ""no thanks"" and i just finished my slaw.  so, why am i giving it 3 stars and not lower?  because, i realize it is a wings venue, after all.  i can't just go hating it because they have what they advertise.  and, both my server and the manager handled the situation with grace and the shrimp was deducted from my bill without my even asking them to do that.  will i be back?  eh, maybe to watch a sports event i crave."
"good service but food is weak. good that there are a lot of tvs with games. boneless thursday's wasn't worth it. overdone, flavorless hot nuggets. couldn't finish. if you're called bww your wings should be right on all the time. eh another chain that spends a lot on ads but should spend more on food production"
"we've always had great servers that are friendly and attentive here! atmosphere is loud enough to bring a noisy toddler. it's a chain so the food is pretty consistent here. would i hour of my way togo here? probably not, but overall it's decent bar food."
solid buffalo wild wings. been here many many times with no memorable issues occurring. does get a little crowded on football sunday's so plan accordingly. wings are usually very good and the service is usually very solid as well
"had late night appetizers.  the grease needed changed as the coating on everything was very gummy and disgusting.  the boneless chicken was the only salvageable item, minus the breading, as none of the other items were not able to remove their coating (mushrooms, cheese sticks, onion rings)complete disappointment after an amazing vanmorrison and willie nelson concert!"
"the worst take out service that i've ever experienced, and it looked like it was horrible service all around the restaurant. my husband loves wings, and after landing at the airport we placed a to go order. they quoted us 15-20 minutes so when we arrived i hopped out of the car to get our food... however, it wasn't that easy.after i paid, they informed me that they still had to make the food. if they said it before i paid, i probably would have just left and went somewhere else. since i had already paid, i waited and waited for about 20 more minutes. they kept saying they were working on the salad, but they must have had to go buy new lettuce. when they made it, they had made it wrong, and i waited about 15 minutes to have them redo it. oh, and then i still left with the wrong salad... left with a bbq chicken salad instead of buffalo...while i was waiting for the food, i couldn't help but watch how disorganized they were. one table didn't have service so they got up and left. hope this place really isn't a ""training store""."
"me and my best friend went here for a late evening craving. we ordered off their happy hour menu for drinks. i loved my margarita. one of the best i have had in a while! i was not expecting it to taste so good.we ordered from half off traditional wings menu. we ordered hot and bbq. they were great. we also got some of their queso dip appetizer.our server was very attentive and kind. he helped us out with the menu and convinced us to get some dessert. we ordered the cheesecake bites and they were amazing!! i wish i could remember his name, but next time i visit, i will be sure to ask!please make your way to b-dubs if you are ever on this side of town in pittsburgh."
"this place is just your typical bdubs. nothing special, nothing that makes it stand out. of course, we had to order the fried pickles because i have some sort of pickle obsession. the pickles are  cornmeal-breaded dill pickle slices fried and served with what i think was a southwestern ranch dressing.i usually order my wings drowning in either parm garlic, or the wild sauce. both are great choices in my book. i usually go with traditional wings though, don't see the point in ordering what are pretty much chicken nuggets. i absolutely always somehow end up with a beer when i am here. it usually tends to be whatever they have as special at that point (especially if i have never had it before). two huge drawbacks with this place though: the service and the fact that it seems to always be a mess here.in all the times that i have been to this location, the service sucks. they are rude and tend to just do their own thing. there has been a few times where i have waiting a good 15 minutes for a beer. and forget about them coming to see how you are doing during the meal.i think the biggest complaint for me is that the place is always a mess. there is usually napkins all over the place and a lot of the tables tend to sit dirty for a long period of time."
"dorian is prerry much the best at customers service ever. he works front desk at my hotel and is a server across the street at bww. he suggested bww to a few of us in the lobby asking about good late night places to eat and he was right . him and bww saved the day :) great food, amazing service , perfect order accuracy,  clean,  not too loud, and good atmosphere.  this bww didn't feel like a chain with a robot waiter instead it was super friendly welcoming home town bar feeling . will be back"
"the experience was ok, our waiter was new and we had to wait at least 30 minutes for our food.  i ordered parmesan garlic wings and the other person got honey bbq wings with a basket of fries to share my food was ok i feel as though my garlic parmesan wings would have been better. i also got a back cherry limeade and that was good, other than that i don't think i will be back to buffalo wild wings in awhile."
"i have not been to bw's in a long time (so long it used to be buffalo wild wings and weck).  this location was selected for my fantasy football draft (my team sucks btw).the location was larger than i thought.   the place was clean and the server very attentive.  i was pleasantly surprised that they had a buy 1 get one free special going on.   the server recommended i change my order to the smaller size since i could double up.    i saved a little money.the place was clean and atmosphere was good.  overall, i liked it."
"this location is in a very busy part of the city and traffic tends to be a tad crazy over here so be prepared. we were a very large table of guests at bww for a friday luncheon and considering how rowdy i know some of these people can be...it was a great time. we were there for about 2 1/2 hours and our waitress allyson did a great job with everyone. a few things here and there were forgotten, like a ranch dip or side salad, but overall it was great. looked like everyone enjoyed their food, and we also received a 15% military discount on our tickets which i know was appreciated by everyone."
the manager really needs to put a no cell phone policy in place unless the bartenders and wait staff are on break! every time i come in here there is staff on their phone and not taking care of customers
"i live in richmond, virginia and i had went to vacation to pittsburg, pa. i was telling everyone how good that buffalo wild wings is so of course i had to show everyone what it was about. i wish there was more restaurants around because they are so good. i always get the same thing, medium boneless and medium sauce, everything was perfect about the service and cleanliness but i would have to say that they should put more sauce on the wings because dry wings aren't that good. and for the people that don't like that much sauce should be asked by waiters how much sauce that they want. will be back!"
"every time i've been there the beer is cold & the food & service is great. the bartenders are friendly and do a great job, and of course the tv's & sports are awesome."
best thing happened: half off traditional wings on tuesday! it was the greatest thing! i got myself spicy garlic which was delicious! my boyfriend ordered hot and wild; he wasn't too much a fan of wild. for dessert we got the cheesecake bites with caramel sauce and the sundae. everything was great and reasonably priced! a great setting to meet with friends.
"experience was subpar - bartender was attentive and friendly - but food was mediocre and manager was miserable. ordered a grilled chicken burger which arrived with a burnt bun and hardly any sauce. the bartender was quick to get the issue fixed. her manager, however, appeared not to care and mentioned that he was ""surprised someone didn't like a charcoal-ed bun"" and offered no apology. traveled here on work, so i don't have to worry about returning; but would caution others."
"bww is quickly becoming me and my boyfriend favorite place to go! the new mac n cheese bites are amazing and our orders come out correct and quick every. single. time. the attentiveness of the wait staff is 10/10. our server today, shaun, was the best service we have ever experienced. refills, extra sauces, he knew the menu fully and was pleasant and professional. amazing job to the entire staff there. even the host, amanda was smiling and greeted us. will always come back and recommend bww!"
"i was here on march 3rd. my waitress sarah seemed uninterested in actually having to serve me since half the food and drinks were delivered by other people and it took over 20 minutes for me to get a beer i ordered by her.i went again tonight hoping for another waitress; that didn't work. the manager, i didn't catch his name put my beer order in and brought my cheese curds. i waited for over 20 minutes after receiving the beer i ordered which was unceremoniously dropped off by sarah, who elected not to say anything or reply to my thank you before i went for a smoke. 15 minutes later after taking 3 other orders and checking on those tables again, i flagged her down for the check.i won't be back. disappointing that i regularly eat alone, eat enough for 2 and tip more than 20% everywhere, yet i can't even order food or get it in a reasonable time from here.left a note about the 30 minute wait time to take an order on the check back.. waitress should find another job not dependent on service times.."
great tv selection for football games. the wings were good but my wife and i disliked the burger and sides. very nice staff though.
had katie as the bartender & she was awesome. very attentive & held great convo.great food & drinks.just moved to the area so this will def be a go to for us.
"place wasn't maintained well, gave us a corner desk and the corner was filled with trash. the service was really slow, took them ages to get our snack of boneless wings."
"the food was good but the server was nowhere to be found. we had to have the person running food and the host track down our waitress.watch out for the $0.60 ranch charge. we didn't even touch the ranch! we didn't ask for it. we were a couple of hungry guys who wanted wings and beer , on a slow night , and our server made it impossible. we wanted to order several rounds of food and beer but couldn't since we didn't have a server.if your cut, fine, whatever get someone to cover your section. i can't bring myself to come back, i felt like i wasn't wanted here at all."
"i want to start off with the counter argument....their wings aren't that great.  the sauces they use however are pretty good and the sandwiches and grilled chicken salads made with them are pretty great.   the space is pretty big and it is a good place to catch a game,  the beer is restaraunt priced as opposed to bar priced, and the beer selection as a whole is limited compared to some other establishments that are around, a better craft beer selection would help them out."
"ouch, have been to this location on three separate occasions the service at the bar was slow at best. friday's after 2pm and before 3:30pm there was one person behind the bar. not a great way to start a weekend. food was cold. i will say that the drinks were fine just took a very long time between them. oh well lessons learned..."
it's simple food easy to make but this place fails on the food level. first walking by the kitchen i glanced in and saw a young lady holding up the table looking at her phone should've walked out right there. ordered the breaded shrimp appetizer they were stuck together and cooked like that. all you gotta do is care just a little and pull the shrimp apart before you drop it. the wings were tossed like her phone was more important then her job some sauce on parts of wings and other parts no sauce. it's clear they are using three different size wings to confuse customers at what they are really seeing.
"one thing about me that everyone knows is i can never turn down a chicken wing! all day, every day, i am dreaming about spicey, delicious, wings. so obviously i need to make one, or several trips to b-dubz! working in gibsonia means i have limited choices for lunches, unfortunately. so i do fine myself here once in a while. this location used to be so slow, i would always go over my 1 hour lunch and that made me really not want to got there. however they do have the guaranteed 15 minute lunch which has been a success every time i have went recently. bravo for fixing that issue! service is generally ok, nothing that blow me away. the food seems to be a little less quality, but it is still good. i love, love, love their buffalitos!! shockingly enough, they also have great salsa! over all this is a good lunch spot, and a nice place in the summer with their patio."
"this is just like every other buffalo wild wings. if you are looking for somewhere to watch a sports game with fellow fans, this is a good place to go. if you are looking to have a dinner and converse when friends, avoid this place. it is very loud all the time. overall, the food is good (i mean, it's wings), and it's a bar atmosphere."
extremely friendly bartenders and wait staff  and $3.25 20 oz michelob ultras for anyone running and training for races in the area!
"haven't been here in a couple years, but damn, currently sitting here and the food order hasn't been taken. it's been 30 min since we ordered our drinks and asked for another minute to look over the menu. a minute, not 30. wish we would have gone to burger'z on 8. the front has like 4 hostesses it seems. not sure, it's like a group meeting or something . don't want to disturb anyone so i guess we will take our check? update:it's been another 20 min. i don't believe this is all our wait(ress)es fault. he/she is working around the area but i don't see anyone else. management seems to be nonexistent. it's semi busy but this is too much. im not sure what the issue is but we won't be back anytime soon."
"best b-dubs i've ever been to, service-wise. i placed an order online and accidentally sent it to the wrong store. the staff was awesome about it: they even called the other store to let them know that i wouldn't be coming. i opted to wait at this location to get my food, and multiple staffers offered me drinks and assured me that this happens all the time. having two restaurants off of ""william ... highway"" is super confusing, so i feel slightly less bad about my error. regardless, they were awesome and any place that handles service issues like this deserves a great review."
i frequent this location every time i drive to pittsburgh. they had some 15 guarantee that i didn't know about. the manager politely explained that because the meal took too long it was free. the food was good- but did take longer then we expected for lunch. the 15 minu
"while the prices aren't bad, you get what you pay for.  in my experience the food is hit or miss.  sometimes the wings are great, sometimes they aren't.  if i go to a restaurant i'm looking for consistency in the food and service.  their waitstaff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.my biggest gripe is that it is extremely loud in there.  even when there isn't any major sporting event on tv.  it is very hard to hold a conversation.  overall, i feel that this is an okay place to go watch a game, but not so great to have a sit down dinner."
"great food and service.  entire family found something they liked.  wings, wraps, burgers and more.  will return."
"we went there last night and i ordered a bacon cheeseburger that wasn't bad at all, but my poor wife orders the grilled chicken tenders and substituted the fries for veggies, after about 30 mins they finally bring our food out and you could instantly see the the chicken tenders were not cooked all the way, in fact they didn't looked grilled at all it was as if they put them on a fryer of like 2 mins and served them to us. so the manager took the tenders off our order but still charged us for the veggies and drink.. disaster.. will never ever go back there.. crappie service and even work cooks. save your money"
"i'm 30 years old, and my fiancé couldn't believe that i've never, ever tried b-dubs in my entire life, so he treated me for st. paddy's day to my first ever b-dubs experience. since it was boneless wing thursday, we each had a few honey barbecue wings before our meal, and ohmigosh the honey barbecue sauce was so good, i was practically licking the sauce off the wings before eating them. for my first meal, i tried the big jack daddy burger...wow! i was so very much in love! hickory smoked pulled pork and onion rings on a burger, it was super delicious! definitely will have to return sometime!"
"very nice place to have good food and drink and watch some sports. went there for a few hockey games and it was pretty cool. having the game on more than 5 big screens is pretty neat! they have a wide selection of drinks which is awesome, and as of yet i have not had a bad meal there! servers are always nice and the wait usually isn't that long for food even on a busy night. certainly a cool hang out, keep up the good work!"
"the wings are always the highlight of my visit when i go here to eat. the selections on tv are very good and entertaining. although it's a good food place it doesn't make for some visits with family. on a busy night it can get very loud, especially if there's a big event that night. however this is great for food and good times."
"finishing the drive from baltimore, got take out here on the way to family's home in the pittsburgh area.  no surprises here for this wings chain.  menu is large and accommodates a range of tastes and levels of health consciousness.  we tried fried pickles, naked chicken tenders, black and blue burger, and chicken wrap with mango habanero (spicy as advertised) sauce.  all solid offerings, good size portions, great value (although maybe we felt this way because pittsburgh is cheaper than baltimore in general).  this place did the job for quick take-out but not sure we'd try it for anything else."
"just left, i have to say my food of the black bean patty and onion rings were very good. my husband ordered boneless wings with parmesan and garlic sauce. they came out without sauce, he sent them back they came back hard as a rock, but they had sauce. we sent them back. we're guessing the manager came over, we said they came hard as a rock, he said he cut them with a spoon. what??? what he should have said is, i'm very sorry, i'll be happy to make a fresh order or would you like something else? what happened to customer service. first time and last time, so much for caring about repeat customers. btw, we stopped at kfc for tenders, he said they were great."
"you only have one life to live...get the cheesecake bites.  on second thought, you deserve it, get two orders.  i really love the bar here and the wings are great too!"
"i love any buffalo wild wings, but this one is especially sweet. the place is huge. large bar area and separate large dining room area.for anyone that has never been to a buffalo wild wings before, check it out! they have stuff for everyone. obviously wings, boneless wings, and a dish in just about every category that you can put wing sauce on. there's plenty of fried bar foods and salads without sauces as well. but you have to try the sauces. there's so many and they're all so different! my personal favorite is the caribbean jerk, followed by the asian zing.plus, if you're a gamer, or have restless children, there's touch games at every booth in the dining area, and you can pay to play against other competetors on the big screen."
i just tried to order wings for take out. not only was the person that answered the phone ignoring me because she was talking to someone in the restaurant she wasn't knowledgable about the menu and wouldn't help me with what i wanted to order. apparently you can't order a specific number of wings that are listed on their menu on days that they do not have wing night. they are a wing place so i am not sure how this makes sense. and you cannot get a variety of sauces for your wings. i ordered my wings from dominos down the street instead. great decision.
"i've always been a fan of this style of food. i was first indroduced to buffalo wild wings in iowa, while in college. since then, their menu continuously inproves, and the offerings are fantastic. this location is the most conveniently located for my typical commute. despite the convenience, i would rate this as the best restaurant in the chain. the staff is friendly, the food is dependably excellent, and the layout is both welcoming and comfortable. please, ""b-dubs,"" take a look at what is going on at this restaurant and use it as an example of how other locations should be. great job, and kudos to the staff for making this an excellent dining experience.pros: you get what you expect, but with lots of extras. it's buffalo wings, and a variety of sauces and sides. other dishes include sandwiches and the like, if you're not in the mood for the flagship offerings. equipment such as seating and counters, entertainment options, etc., are all in good clean shape.cons: there could be easier parking lot access."
"regarding visit 4/4/18.in the past, i've not been really impressed with bbw.  i hadn't been back in over a year, and thought i'd try it again with my family.  unfortunately, i was not impressed once again.the service was great, but our food was down right... eh.  mediocre, at best.we ordered the newer pretzel appetizer.  the cheese that came with it was great.  the pretzel would have been great, too.  if it wasn't for the fourteen pounds of salt that came on it.  seriously--i think there was more salt than pretzel.  see picture from my visit.i had the buffalo chicken wrap..and everything in it was barely 'ok'.  it tasted like it had been sitting out for an hour or two before being served.  bland, barely any toppings, quickly thrown together, and.. old?"
i've always thought the location was weird but it has plenty of its own parking away from the home depot. we came here for an early dinner after shopping and to our surprise they were having a special on boneless wings. i ordered the medium and they were pretty hot but a good hot. my husband got the buffalo and he said they were good. we absolutely love their deep fried picklechips which was our main reason for choosing to eat here today. we did have to wait for a minute to be greeted and seated but after that our waitress was great. they also give tablets for the kids to play games at the table which was really nice for our 5 year old while waiting on our food.
my favorite wings! best sauces and reasonable food prices make this economically awesome! it's also family friendly.
"if it were not for the atmosphere and entertainment options, bww would be out of business.  i will admit it is a very fun place to get a beer and watch a game.  my wife and i also enjoy the game options the provide while you eat.  but that is the only good of this place.the food is so mediocre it is mind blowing.  if you have ""wings"" in your name, i expect you to have at least above average wings.  i can and have made better tasting wings in my oven than you get at bww.  they are never crispy and i have never had a sauce that has impressed me.  on top of that, the ranch tastes like bottled ranch.  they are the same whether you go regular or boneless wings.  i won't go as far as to say they are bad.  if i have the choice between tysons frozen wings and bww, i'll probably choose bww.  however, the difference is not very substantial.  other than the wings, their sandwiches and the rest of the food is also nothing more than average.  they do have good appetizers, and the potatoe wedges are delicious.  stick to beers and apps unless you enjoy bad food."
"nice sports bar, really like the garlic parm sauce on wings (they do put it on heavy, which i like) if you like to eat your food warm, don't order it until you finish eating your app...as many years as i've come here, they bring your food out almost immediately after serving the app and the app is either wasted or my food gets cold...i've learned that i have to pace the servers myself...and plan on waiting to pay, the servers will bring your bill you can take a long winters nap and need a shave and a haircut by the time they return to pick it up...(slow or busy times, at least they are consistent) food is typically good."
"i haven't been to this buffalo wild wings location in a very long time. me and fiancé went during the day on a sunday and there hardly anyone there. we sat the bar and the waiter was nice but she moved too slow. she was slow serving us, slow making our drinks, slow asking us for our order. just overall slow! we were the only people at the bar and we couldn't understand why she was serving us at a slow pace. other than that the food was awesome as always."
boneless wings came dry and cold. think they were from the day before. maybe we'll stick to bone in and hope they are fresh at another location
"yesterday was my first day living in pa and the first day of hockey playoffs. we wanted to watch a non-penguins game so buffalo wild wings was the safest choice. the bar area:the place was filled with jerseys and fans braving the workday to cheer on their home team. the staff was kind enough to put the red wings game on a side tv for us. back home in tx it's hard enough getting one tv for hockey but this place was filled with hockey! bless you pa. bless you.service:there is no ""i"" in this bww's ""team""! our waitress was prompt and attentive. our food was brought out by many different team members so it was served as it came out the kitchen. food:the wings were saucy, the burger was delicious, and the buffalo chips were the cherry on top. we didn't make happy hour which was a bummer but the tall beers were a reasonable price."
"pretty good as buffalo wild wings go. very clean. good service. the wings were not dry and were very flavorful. they gave out free samples of a new beer, and i love that. not as many people here as i would expect on a tuesday night. there was a regular crew at the bar, but i expected more out-of-towners being so close to a number of hotels. it was a little hard to get to, but that could just be pittsburgh driving."
"this is going to be quick.they offer a bunch of different seasonings and sauces for their wings and celery and carrots are included at no extra charge. every time i've visited, i've had a great experience. the food is prepared well and the servers are attentive, friendly and helpful."
"was upcharged for ordering traditional instead of boneless wings. several details of our order were not correct. dressing was supposed to be on the side. food was almost cold, seemed like it was sitting for a long time before we got it.overall bland, underwhelming food. overpriced for the quality. felt sick after eating."
we came on a week night and it was packed. we grabbed the only open table in the bar. we found out it was was boneless wing 55cent night. i ordered a wrap and my hubby ordered an appetizer sampler platter. it too fifty five minutes to get our food. my order wasn't even correct. the only reason they are getting one star is because our server was extremely nice.
good food but watch what time you come in it gets packed here but other than that it's good
this is the closest buffalo wild wings to me so i do not go to another often. most of the time i get take out from here but have eaten inside a few times. i know to take a jacket because every time i eat inside it is freezing inside. however the service is typically pretty good and the food is decent. my complaint is about the take out service. it is horrible! i always sit and wait for my order for about an extra 10-15 minutes!! it is never ready by the time i arrive. even if i order it an hour before. i also always ask for well done wings and most of the time they aren't well done and are barely cooked when ordering takeout. not pleased and probably won't be back for a while.
great atmosphere but the only thing u should order are the wings and nothing more.  thier nachos suck.   i mean really.  its the easiest thing to make. it lacks good chips and the right amount of ingredients & the  hamburger are frozen patti's with a wierd texture. 3 of us order them & didn't eat them. pull pork needs help too.  so in a nut shell stick to wings.
"this was my first time in this location, and last. be sure of that. the service when you are sitting at the bar is horrible. no matter how good wings and beer are done, they are nothing without good service. i couldn't get a drink here to save my life. took forever between time i got a menu and the time they took my order. they served my dinner along side my appetizer at the same time. they also run the glass washer right next to the customers. it has the most foul sewer odor ever. just what you want when eating. even the bartender agreed with me about how it smelled. disgusting. never again for me. had to edit:i left out that i never got napkins, silverware, ketchup or salt. i ended up fending for myself off of a table nearby when i got tired of waiting."
"wow!  what great customer service. nikki was absolutely fantastic!  not only did she confirm and repeat our order back to us, and she made us a fresh pot of coffee for our lunch.  #aboveandbeyond service.  check these guys out!!!"
"came here for dinner with my parents and fiancé for lunch today. i ordered the blazing wings, my fiancé had garlic, my dad had traditional, and my mom had the salad. we also had sides of fries and macaroni and cheese.food is decent -- reasonably priced, pretty salty, a little fatty, but good ol' sports bar food. i think the location has very little to do with that. the wings aren't very saucy so you might want to ask for extra sauce on the side, if you're into saucy wings.service was very good -- the server changed the tv to the world series of poker for me, kept coming with drink refills and napkins and extra sauces without batting an eye. was also seated and waited upon quickly.overall a good meal for the price. it could be better, but for the price, it's a good value."
"the wings are well prepared and very tasty. the different varieties of sauces make it easy to taste different degrees of sauce and tastes. we ordered the large wings with four different sauces, to share. the wings were great, with the right amount of sauce. we also ordered a large onion rings, which were awesome. cooked perfectly and hot and crisp. the service provided was also excellent. as we were there around 2:30 on a friday afternoon, it was not overly crowded. as this is a sports bar, and not real busy, we really all enjoyed our meals.if you want good wings with a large choice of sauces and bone in or out, check out this location."
this is my favorite buffalo wild wings. i staff is great and the food is hot and fresh.
"a great place to watch the big games.  great beer selection, friendly staff.  $3.50 tall drafts and your choice if liquor monday thru friday 2pm - 6pm and 9 pm to close.  can't wait to see  mcgregor vs  khabib. in ufc 229."
the staff is always friendly here. the food is always good and they always will put the game i'm interested in on (if it isn't on already). great place to eat!
got a carry out. the large which was 20 wings my wife wanted flats which they gladly did. we had two different sauces teriyaki and sweet bbq . the teriyaki was way to sweet. the bbq sauce was good. the fries were fries. the person waiting on us was pleasant. the order came out quick which was nice.
"had a bad takeout order. however, the manager made it right. our boneless wings must of been cooked incorrectly or something. i understand things happen and i'm thankful the manager understood and they gave us credit for our meal to give it another shot.  one complaint i have in general is that i was told that their order of moz sticks come in a quantity of 5-6 for $7.98 which seems wildly overpriced. however, i will be going back. i mean, it's bdubs. you have to eat there every once in a while."
great restaurant with a good atmosphere and amazing staff! would definitely recommend this bww!
this is a typical buffalo wild wings.  stopped in last week on a saturday night.  we were looking to get out for a bit and ended up there.  the place was very busy and full.  a mix of families and sports enthusiasts.   we sat in the bar area as it was a bit faster and easier to  find seats.i usually get wimgs but decided ti change it up a bit and got the southwest philly cheese steak.  i should have gotten wings.  the sandwich was okay but the hint of southwest kind of ruined the sandwich for me.  it was food mind you but just left me feeling let down.as with most buffalo wild wings it was loud and raucous.  the place was clean and the staff was friendly.  the service was adequate and will be hteat once they get a few more staff.  it felt that it took a bit to get my sandwich and my friend's wings.  the price does seem to just keep rising though and i don't like that the menu doesn't define the numbwr of wings in each tier.
"the food is overprices chicken nuggets.  it is what it is.  what brings us back to this place (and this specific location) is the service.  this place has the best, and most consistent service in the area.  we know when we come in, we are going to get cold, fresh beer, hot food, and wonderful service!  it always brings us back.  the food isn't terrible, so that helps. :) when the hubs and i can't decided what to have for dinner, this is usually our fall back because we know we will get a hot meal and good service.  we notice the restaurant is always clean, and there is always enough staff.  talking to a server on a pretty busy night, she mentioned that the management gets the tournament schedule from fraser ice arena so they know when to schedule more staff.  wow!  making sure you have enough staff when you know you are going to be busy!?  it seems like a no-brainer, but a lot of people don't understand how huge that is! we notice a lot of servers have been there a while and that says a lot about the management and the place as a whole.  when your staff is happy, your customers are happy!"
they skimp out on fries. as always. and who needs that many televisions on? explains the skimping fries. saving food in cost of electric bill.
"very overpriced frozen wings (over a buck a small wing). the ordering is confusing in regards to small, med and large wings. no one knows what that means and how hard would it be to just go by the pound or pieces.  sauces are really good. my favorites are teriyaki, spicy garlic, garlic parmesan and asian zing. the wings are usually undercooked for my liking so i get them well done.  will go there if i need too but there are many other places that have better and cheaper wings."
"the food was great as usual, but unfortunately the service was what killed my visit here. the place was pretty empty so we decided to take a table near the tvs toward the bar area of the restaurant. strike 1 i guess because it wasn't the ""correct"" area to take a seat at. he didn't ask us to move, but was clearly annoyed with us already. he took our drink orders and did not come back for quite some time. strike 2. next came the food. he took our orders and brought  the food out separately, so some of us were sitting there with no food for a bit. strike 3. strike 4 came when there was no ranch/blue cheese like my friends had asked for, as well as my wings that had the wrong sauce on them i guess that is strike 5. after all that was fixed, the food was still great, it was just hard to get to that point."
"this is probably one of the nastiest buffalo wild wings establishments i have ever been to. used to love coming here with my family but all the employees are rude!!!!! floor was a mess, and there was garbage everywhere by the table i was sitting. ordered my drinks and it took too long to get them. our servers name was kara, and she barely checked on my family throughout my meal, had to go forever without refills!!!! everybody gave dirty looks and my mac and cheese bites were cold. cooks clearly don't know where they are doing. disgusting establishment. rude, dirty, and distrusting. would rather take my money to mount clemens location!!!!"
we went 8/19 about 4 p.m.  our service was excellent! the hamburger i ordered could have been mistaken for a hockey puck. it was unbelievably over cooked. as they didn't ask me how i wanted it cooked i am thinking it was frozen? so disappointing. the potato wedges were also tiny little shriveled up nuggets. the chips and salsa were great. my husbands onion rings looked good. overpriced for the quality.
a great place to hangout and eat good wings and watch sports on big screens. also a great restaurant franchise.
there's literally bugs all over the limes and cherries. been here a few times and it's always the same. the waitresses are nice but this place is pretty gross when it comes to cleanliness. i've been to bdubs all over the place and this one needs a lot of attention from corporate. the restaurant itself appears dirty and not well maintained. seeing bugs in a food establishment is always a 1-star deal. now i understand why my friends avoid this place like the plague.
scam alert! i got taken for an add on to my credit card tip at this location! my tip was entered as a higher amount than for what i truly put down.pay attention to your charges. i heard back from the manager that she entered it wrong. here nor there - he can only go on her word and what he sees as she entered the tip as higher.wings have gotten better than in the past - but this experience makes me very cautious.
"i visited with a party of 9 (bill was over $200.00) at the bww on 15 & utica on a tuesday - i ordered a large wings and requested all flats - the waitress politely said they could not do that because it was 1/2 price but would send her manager over.  the manager came over and said, you wanted to see me ... i asked for all flats and his response was no we don't do that, and walked away...very poor customer service!!!"
ask for samantha she's the best waitress there she will take damn good care you and never gets upset the extra she does great work and a good personality and when did you go in there deafly asked for her
just moved to the area. was craving bdubs....female a takeout counter hands me my receipt asked me to sign it and as i'm looking down at my receipt throws the food to have me view it. food looks good for the two seconds that the female at the takeout counter showed me kind of rude pushy not very nice. did not seem like she wanted to be there and definitely not very customer-friendly
food is way overpriced. service was friendly when he wasn't watching tv. if you like bww you will like it.
"so after working out with my friends. they decided they were hungry. so!! we drove over to this spot.i am quite fond of b-dubs, so yea,, wings, beer,,, yes!we did the mushrooms which was totally yummy. crispy, crunchy with mushroomy center that just explodes in your mouth. careful though, these are hot af. so use caution.let's see, it was tuesday that day, so we ordered a small which converted into 20 wings. 4 sauces,, one was my mango habanero which i always choose. my husband had the spicy garlic and our friend did the garlic parm and sweet bbq. also, we did a basket of wedges with cheese and bacon.we destroyed all that. had 2 tall boy miller lights to help push em down as well.the place was nice and clean, service was impeccable. yes! excellent experience here. i would come and eat here again.thank you so much for reading my review. i hope this helps with your decision making experience. enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!"
"food is good and fresh, and always hot! i like this location more than others, although the service can be spotty. some days it's amazing, others i have almost walked out. at least they make sure i have a full beer... that's a true bonus"
the service is awful! absolutely horrific. they are really lucky i like wings because i would not be coming back. multiple occasions i would get takeout and they would forget something. however the food is good. it sometimes takes a long time to get to me. and that is not cool. but whatever.
decided togo here to eat wings because it was half off on tuesday. this location use to be ok just so so but after the management change this place been on top of there game food been very fresh and good the wings are juicy and big all the food taste way better the quality also got way better. service been very good too. this will be my goto bdub for wings to me this location is the best one to me and i'm everytime i want wings i'm coming here only and also this is one of the locations that sells the half off wings all day long not like the other ones that stop at a curtain time which is weird
"i always come here for half off wings tuesdays with my family and friends. never had any bad experience before. the foods are not the greatest but prices are very reasonable. the wings here is hands down one of the best i've had. many flavors and sauces to chose from. i always get the mango habenero, parmesian garlic, hot, and sometime whenever i like to live dangerously and be adventerous, i get the blazing sauce lol. all in all, its a great place to get wings compared to hooters. thank god that hooters on big beaver and rochestor closed down. the wings at hooters doesnt even come close to buffalo wild wings. if you want delicious and tasty wings then look no further, buffalo wild wings is the place to be!"
this restaurant is amazing. last week the bogo boneless was very good for the entire family. would recommend any time
"honestly don't know why i come back. i can think of at least 4 places i like the wings better, but i decided to give it another shot. also, online order system is terrible, got to the restaurant only to be told my order didn't go thru."
not only is service poor at the troy location but the food quality in general is going downhill.
"very unfriendly staff! interacted with two. one who served our table. and the other on the take away counter from whom we bought couple of sauces. both of them were not warm and friendly. no smile at all, no response to our thank yous! very poor experience. the wings were alright. the guinness beer was not rightly poured. overall not recommended!"
"buffalo wild wings has to be the worst place to eat at . all their foods are pre-cooked and pre-frozen nothing is homemade . and their sauces are made by nestlé , and nestlé is known to process every original item and make it really bad. don't believe me read the fine print on the back of all their sauces."
disgusting place. ate here for lunch and was sick the rest of the day. avoid it at all cost.
flavors are great but the service is too slow perhaps its the ladies playing on their phones and eating boh? do they not have a breakroom for the employees?
"we got carry-out from this location for the first time, and they forgot half of my daughter's kids meal (the drink and the side!). i went online and filled out the contact form as directed by the receipt. i requested a manager contact me, and i haven't heard from anyone."
this place is so freakin slow! came here with my girlfriend for drinks it literally took them 30 mins to get us our drinks and we were the only ones in the place! i feel like this bdubs needs to step up their game cause we wont be returning here!!!!
great food for sure! the longest wait i have ever experienced for carryout at 9:15pm. last week i stopped into the troy location around 9:15pm and was told 50 min for a crispy chicken ranch wrap. i expected to wait 20-30 min but 50 min is crazy at this time of night when it is not a big game day and past the dinner rush. i emailed the manager to loop him in to the extensive wait and he replied (politely) with all of the reasons why it happened as opposed to trying to find a solution to make it faster. then he offered me $10 for my wait... this was the largest insult because he tried to satisfy my concern with a $ amount that would not even pay for my full meal. i'm disappointed because i was hoping for a change so i could grab carryout more often without the extensive wait time and unfortunately received excuses paired an offer of $10. huge bummer!
"it's rare that a place leaves me dissatisfied so consistently. bw3's used to be pretty decent, but in recent years it's gone downhill. they just did away with their half price wings on tuesday, which was the only financially justifiable time to visit. the food is fairly mediocre bar food, nothin special, but not bad, but typically not worth the price. i can see how the environment is appealing if you're a sports enthusiast. bottom line, this place reeks of corporate greed, i feel like i'm be nickel- and-dimed every time i come for food that is considered passable."
"i placed a pick up order 3 separate times. twice the order was not ready despite showing up 30 minutes  after placing the order. twice the order was incorrect with no ambition to correct it! i still had to wait another 40 minutes for my order to be fixed as staff ""just put in a new order"". they could care less how long i had to wait. then they would not even give me a 10% discount or compensate me in any way for my wait due to them screwing up my orders. although the food tastes good, this location is not worth the hassle! it is worth it to eat at another location."
the staff was polite. unfortunately my meal was not tasty. every thing tasted like old grease. i was able. to stomach sharing the taco appetizer but threw the oily burger away and snacked on tums all night. not normal for this restaurant but very disappointing.
"bdubs is just meh with the chicken wings. mine are better and crunchy and chewy, not slimy like bdubs.  the meat was white, but a true chicken wing cook knows to let it fry until the skin is crispy not when the meat is done. the cherry wheat beer on tap is the only reason i return. otherwise, i need a new wing place."
"i tried this location a few nights ago. there was no wait as the place was fairly empty. i ordered a beer, a small order of boneless wings, and a side of fries. the fries and beer were okay but the wings came out cold kind of like when you microwave something and comes out still frozen in the center. i think they microwave their wings here. needless to say, i won't be going back. b dubs has really lost its way because their food used to be awesome."
"yikes! the last few times we've been here, it hasn't been all that great! :( seems like every time we go there, the waitresses tell us, before we even order, that the food is gonna take a while to come out. i can understand busy sports nights, or kids night, but i kid you not, its been 4 out of the last 5 times. the last time we did carry out, i ordered the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich, with cheese and medium sauce only. it came with cheese only, no sauce... like come onnnn, that's what makes it good! they never ever remember to put ranch in the bag for carry out either. last night...omg. our waitress was super sweet and apologetic, but we waited well over an hour for our food. we were watching the hall of fame game, so we weren't in a huge hurry, but we were hungry lol. and to top it off...my boyfriend found legit feathers still in one of his wings. the waitress was even grossed out. she offered new wings but he only had like 2 left anyway. i thought maybe we would get a little something taken off our bill considering the circumstances, but we didn't. oh well. wings and sports will always be my favorite lol, but i think i might pass on bdubs for a little while."
"man those chipotle dry rubbed traditional wings on the buy 10 get 10 were spicy. they loaded those so heavy like they were sauce dipped i can appreciate that, i always say "" go big or go home "" and bdubbs you went big! thank - you ps the people a1"
"food is ok, like upgraded bar food. they're options have improved over the years (more than just fried foods). service was ok. not really a place that i crave.i did like the giant pretzel with dip, and salads have gotten better. they're specialty of course is chicken wings, and those don't disappoint. sauces are very tasty."
"sitting at the bar with my husband , the bartender made sure he had a beer but yet i sat waiting for mine. really!!!"
"i've only been to bww a handful of times over the last few years, most notably near my girlfriend's work while waiting for her shift to end.  i pretty much had a beer and the popcorn shrimp.  if not the best in the world, it was quick and easy and i love shrimp.this last weekend we decided to give bww a shot out on eureka rd.  we went in on a sunday, i'd say around 2pm.  it wasn't crowded in the bar area so we sat at the bar.  the first plus for bww was getting cold beer.  they don't have quite the selection that, say, old chicago has, but they must server a lot of beer because it was cold and they didn't even frost the glasses.for food, my girlfriend got a regular ol' hamburger, which she says was good.  you have to take her word for it, and with a little bit of skepticism because as long as you can call it 'food' she likes it.  i had the southwestern philly and i loved it.  it was messy and gooey, with thin slices of beef topped with queso and a sauce i can't quite describe except it was definitely 'southwestern'.  bear in mind that this isn't michelin level fine dining, but if you're cool with bar food and a relaxed atmosphere, i found it thoroughly enjoyable.  even the music, which i thought at first was too loud, wasn't a big deal after a bit.  if i had one complaint?  not enough fries."
"food quality is good, but their service has dropped off significantly over the past year.  used to consistently have a manager stop by the table at some point during the meal to check on everything, but i haven't seen one at any of my recent visits, and the lack of hands on management is showing.stopped for lunch on a saturday, and had a 5 minute wait for a table.  when we were seated there were a number of open tables in our section, including three that were dirty and hadn't been cleared.  they were finally cleared 10 minutes after we were seated.  waitress rushed through our ordering, and food was delivered by an expediter from the kitchen.  the waitress was absent other than checking on us once and refilling our waters.  as we ate, two other parties near us finished and left.  both of those tables sat dirty for 10-15 minutes while we ate, so i got to look at other people's dirty dishes, cups, and chicken bones until someone finally got around to bussing them."
ordered carryout online picked up food when it said order would be ready and food was cold and my cheeseburger was burnt to a crisp! extremely disappointed
"there is no other synonymous place for wings, beer and sports than buffalo wild wings. the undisputed king of a sauce game and there's no denying it. a lot of people come for tuesdays as their wings are roughly around 60cents each. yea they use to be 25 cents but that's back when the dinosaurs walked the earth and gas was $6 per gallon.anyways, let's talk about this particular restaurant. it's the closest to me, so i usually frequent this spot whenever we get the craving for wings and beer. my boyfriend and my nephew do love their snake bites. i just do their tall specials, i'm more of a miller lite guy. nothing snooty, just serve it to me cold and in a glass and i will love you for life.everybody has a favorite sauce here. i happen to like the spicy spectrum side of the sauce kingdom. mango habanero is the sauce of choice for me. then i happen to see that they've reformulated their blazin sauce with ghost chili. so i came, i ordered and i conquered this bad child. yes it's delish, but extremely spicy. this is definitely no food for the weak. order from cheesy bacon fries with that to share and you're definitely good to go.the service is great, you come in, the host exchanges pleasantries. asks where you wanna be seated then takes you to wherever you prefer. the server is great as well, checked up on us from time to time. everything is as close to perfect as possible. thank you buffalo wild wings for a pleasant experience. we'll see you again next time we're craving some spicy wings."
"by far the best service for any of the bww in the area. easily surpassing woodhaven ( the worst),  westland and livonia.   canton's is usually good too, but this one is consistently the best and we choose this one over woodhaven ever though it was a longer drive.   there were 4 of us and we all ordered wings and drinks.  caitlyn, our server, was excellent.   our alcohol, pop, and water was never empty.  we enjoy coming here and will in the future."
"so gross...  they should call it ""get your angel wings"" because the amount of grease, hygiene, lack of anything that hasn't been fried or their only vegetable option (in the entire restaurant) is celery and carrots! environment: dirty, unsanitary and dangerous (see photos) price: ridiculous for the qualityoptions: glorified ""bar food"" with no optionsif you want to kill a spouse, friend or a child slowly... take them here to eat twice a week!"
if you want to eat cheap on the run come to buffalo wild wings on tuesdays and thursdays for the $0.70 wings special i try to hit it if i'm near there and believe me there's always room to take some home delicious leftovers and great service that's what i get at buffalo wild wings
"we decided to sit outside since it was a nice night,  i thought we would have to put up with feeling like we were left out since we were the only ones on the patio.  megan was our waitress,  were have never had such great service.  we've been here several times and never had any complaints about the service but tonight was exceptional.  thanks again megan!"
"i am just as surprised as you are that this restaurant received 5 stars, but i had a perfect visit.  disclaimer-we did go for lunch and not dinner or during any major sporting event.  historically, every bww i go to during an event is overpacked, long waits, horrible service and expensive.  this was still pricy, but service was excellent and we had our food in under 15 minutes.  i didn't get wings this time, but it seems to me the prices go up for wings every time i visit which is unfortunate.  i do like the nacho appitizer a lot, though.  beer selection is very good and they do mix beers like a black and tan or black and blue and a lot more."
first of all i have to say the waitress's need to pay attention to all people at the table and not just the male at the table.. and make the female feel extremely uncomfortable the entire time!! clearly you were not trained correctly you always ask a female what she would like to drink/order first. as i'm sure they would expect the same thing if they were to walk into a restaurant with their significant other. another thing the wings come out tasting like they got microwaved real quick not hot at all!! this place is becoming a joke.
"my experience was not the best , went in with the kids for a dinner , the server was the least bit friendly, very bothered with children and was irritable when asked anything , the food didn't come out as expected and she didn't come back til end to tell us shift changed and needed to cash out ! the food wasn't great but after the server snapping about lettuce and tomato and getting a salad over fries we got up to leave and went and talked to the manager , the general manager was there and took care of it with out a question, voided our bill and gave us a credit to come back , and to me customer service is very important in a business and this showed he cared ! so 4 stars for the managers awesome service ! and 0 stars for the server"
awful location. my dinner was ruined by this location allowing  people to smoke on the patio. there were four people smoking scattered around. absolutely disgusting!!!!!
"this is not the place to go if you've just started a diet! my son ordered the honey bbq with no spice. he dug in so quickly until i couldn't get a picture! he said that they were delicious.i had just started my new eating plan aka diet, so i ordered the ceasar salad. it was good. we ordered carry-out (wings-24) the next night to share with friends."
"we had just came from a festival & wanted to have a quick lunch. the service was horrible, we waited an hour for our food & the chicken was over cooked! it was really busy too & the lady who served us never stopped by to ask how we were doing, or give us refills for our drinks. the food was decent though."
"i love buffalo wild wings.  this is the best place to go to for a group setting.  definitely the go to place to watch sports.  kid friendly which is a plus.  this location is great, food is always good and the customer service is great.  they have convenient parking for to go orders."
"great location right on eureka, service is  hit or miss. waitresses  usually seem uninterested  in giving proper attention to customers,even when not busy. food was typical,we ordered a burger and fries & boneless  wings and fries.  tip:stick with the chicken. burger was grisly and seemed to be a cheap frozen burger. not good when you leave a whole burger minus a bite. overall, many other options in the area. don't  think we will be returning."
"i like wings. i like b-dubs. this location isn't the greatest in metro-detroit. it's a nice enough place, looks like all the other b-dubs. but it's just not as nice as some of the others(mt. clemens, mound rd., etc)but whatever. our table was sticky. it took a while for anyone to attend to us after we sat. however, when our waitress arrived she was sweet and attentive for the remainder of our visit. the food was up to snuff. they have some great sauces. we usually go elsewhere for wings, but this place is worth a visit in a pinch."
"ordered food through the app on a friday night around 9pm. wings didn't taste fresh, and were kind of cold. fried pickles had too much breading, not crispy, and were also cold. mozzarella sticks were cold.will not be coming back."
"i live down the street from this bdubs but i will gladly drive to the 15 and utica location for the mildly better service. this place is that bad.food takes forever to come out, even if they are just wings - nothing special. when they do come out, at least someone's meal in our 4 person family has gone completely cold. the servers don't seem to care. i have been here multiple times where we are seated, it's not busy, and it takes someone 10 mins to greet us and get our drinks. to be honest, i'm not sure why we stay. we keep wanting to give this place a chance, time and time again, just to be disappointed."
"ordered takeout resentfully after reading these reviews. all i ordered is traditional wings with 2 different sauces. the order was technically correct but there wasn't enough sauce put on the wings to cover them all. some of the wings were completely bare. the worst part is that they were very cold, as if they were actually cooked well before i ordered them. i live 5 minutes away so there is no way they could have been cooked sauced and already that cold. unbelievable!!  obviously piss poor management and quality control. hey buffalo wild wings!!  fire this manager. they clearly have no idea how to run a staff. will never go back."
"went for my sons 4th birthday. it was a wednesday and we had no idea it was kids night. it was crowded and loud, but with 2 small kids, we didn't mind at all. didn't wait too long for a table and the kids enjoyed the atmosphere.  it's was nice that the kids meals were cheaper since they barely eat anything anyway. i had plain wings with mild sauce and blue cheese. hubs had a chicken wrap. both were great and the kids had a blast. they have both been asking to go back and we will soon!!"
"first let me start by saying that pretty much the food at every one of these places is mediocre at best, and that i only go here when i'm traveling and need to watch sports on television.  this is my first appearance at this particular one, i usually go to the dearborn location but didn't want to make the 25 minute drive, in hindsight, i wish i had made the drive.  apparently you're not supposed to go sit in the bar without a hostess seating you there, dearborn is not like that.  so i sat for an entire quarter of an nfl game with waitress after waitress walking past me and looking at me and no one ever stopped or acknowledged me there.  finally after forever, someone came and asked me if i was planning on eating and i replied yes i was but that i would need a menu in order to do so. i was told the section was closed and that's why i had sat so long with no one coming to the table.  comically however there were three tables by mine that had diners there and they were getting served no problem.   i'm still confused on that one, but hey, maybe it's a michigan thing.  long story short, i ordered nachos and then left at halftime because the service was so poor in this location, that i couldn't stand it one second longer.  my advice, go to the michigan avenue dearborn location if you must do b dubs, or maybe there's a better local sports bar you could go to and forego the entire bww experience altogether.  i heard arby's bought the chain, they should just sell their fast food sandwiches and curly fries there from now on as it would be an improvement over what's served there now."
"one of the worst sit down restaurant meals i've ever had if not thee worst. the chicken wings were so small and ancient looking and you could literally see the veins and blood on the bone peaking out through dry spicy garlic sauce. it was so visually unappealing and the wings were so lukewarm seconds after they were bought to the table  that i just tossed them when i got home. i will never, ever, ever return!"
this location has a chance to be the sports bar in the scs area and has the worst service with the worst food! it's a shame the owner doesn't hire a decent chef and a wait staff that actually wants to be there...
amazing place nice and affordable wait staff excellent will recommend to anyone  definitely would come again it was a little chilly and the chicken was a little dry but other than that it was an amazing experience the drinks don't taste like alcohol which could be a good thing if you dont want to know your drinking alcohol
"i usually order carry out (which they usually botch and makes me want to never return) but decided tonight to dine in. i was very pleased with the whole experience, which i would describe as fast and friendly. the kids were happy, i was happy, food was great, the waitress was amazing!our waitress did a top notch job!  she remembered all the little details, like i want cherries on the side for my kids and not in my cherry wheat beer. she told us about the happy hour specials, even though it was 5:50 when we arrived and happy hour ends at 6 pm (the street tacos tasted great, too spicy for the kids though). she offered us water (i didn't have to ask). i didn't have to wait for the bill. excellent job!!  i've given up on ordering regular wings but may try them again during my next visit here.  i ordered the wild boneless and thai boneless (1/2 off on thursdays). they had a nice crunch and soft interior. just perfect!my kids had the mac n cheese and bbq boneless wings with mandarins off the kiddie menu, which they both enjoyed. they both had the loaded ice cream scoop for dessert which is a mini version of the nacho dessert. yummy!!overall, i was very pleased and will definitely return in the future. one of the better bdubs locations i've been to, just don't order carryout.  great job!!"
the only good thing about this dump was that the toilet was relatively clean when the inevitable trots arrived....oh and leaving. never again !
wait for carry out going on 45 minutes!!! this is ridiculous customer service there are so many of us standing around in the lobby go somewhere else chicken next time
best part of the meal was leaving.service was bad..had to use the paper my sandwich was on for a napkin. food took forever..a substitution cost 2 bucks and an ad on salad was 4.25. no refills on drinks. in the biz..good to know i'm doing things right cuz this meal was a complete 180 from anything close to ok let alone right. left a 10 percent tip...9 percent to much. you guys have been warned.
"this place needed an update, i had a positive experience while having some wings and a brew. i've see some overall positive improvements at this location, which i have been dropping by since they first opened. the staff was friendly and the food was exactly as it was supposed to be... no complaints from me, even had some tvs in the restroom, which was also very clean. also they had a happy hour from 4-6 pm, it was a dollar off tall tap beer and a deal on some of the appetizers..."
well if you like wrong orders nasty staff totally unprofessional this is the place for you don't order on line or call an order in or even dine in unless you like getting the wrong food i would not go here even if it were free for life they suck i have to give a star so this will post but i would not give them any ever
picture speaks for itself.  and these are the wings that replaced an order i sent back due to the obscenely small size.  the manager defended the size as well......
"service was horrible. waited 15 minutes and no one even stopped to recognize we were even there. all the tables were empty, the staff were standing around and the tables were filthy."
"this place is just simply not good! out of all of the locations though this one is probably the worst. when we arrived it wasn't that busy and we were told at the door that we could find the table we wanted to sit at and they would clean it off since there were no clean tables in the restaurant. i didn't really understand that concept since there appeared to be plenty of staff working. we found a booth that was actually clean and sat there. i immediately heard the server complaining to the host about being ""double sat"" and how she was trying to take a break. surprisingly, our server was rather friendly when she came to the table, and she provided friendly service for the remainder of the meal. i ordered a draft beer which took about ten minutes to arrive. when it arrived we decided to place our food order since the service seemed like it was going to be slow. i ordered a steak & cheese wrap with buffalo chips on the side. food arrived and it wasn't that it was inedible - it's just not that good. the quality seems low, the taste seems bland, and my wrap consisted of more wrap than anything! very small amount of buffalo chips on the side. it's not that the check was terribly expensive, but for $42 you should be getting a lot more. the reason they earned even a one star review is because they were playing the world series and i got to watch verlander pitch!"
"do not waste your money at this location!! i was with a group of people celebrating a teen bday.  first of all, the service was pretty bad.  the waitress kept getting lost. she kept forgetting things we needed.  the food... oh my, the worst ever!!! their chicken was not completely done.. they slap some sauce on it and call it good chicken. their quesadillas are bad!!! bland and too much cheese in certain areas.. my sister ordered a burger, they told her it had to be well done so she said it taste bland and bad!!! this is my second time visiting and i won't be back!!"
"so i don't know why we keep giving all buffalo wild wings locations chances. they all are almost exactly the same thing slow service, and slow food. we keep hoping it's just the server or maybe the location but nope almost all bww are exactly the same. it sucks because the wings are pretty good but i can't tell you the last time we had a dinner here that didn't take over an hour and a half. good luck with to go orders, last time half our order was wrong, even with the giant sticker that said it was double checked for accuracy. do not recommend."
"so, besides the recent negative press on this location, we still enjoy the close location to our home. the food, as with every bww, is good and tastes freshly cooked. the service is pretty good, but depending on the servers you might have quite the wait while they flirt with the bar staff. i hate waiting with an empty beer, so i'll drink at home and we usually grub hub now..."
i am so happy we came to this location. this buffalo wild wings has great service. our waiter was brian. he was phenomenal. he did a great job balancing all the tables that he was waiting on. the food was very good. he checked on us the perfect amount of times. wings were very fresh and the onion rings are so good. the spinach dip was tasty and cooked to perfection. i am coming back for sure. also join the blazin rewards so you can redeem food. you can download it on the app store.
just another one of your typical buffalo wild wings. really is not anything special from the others. who doesn't like going some where for some chicken wings and some cold beer. they have a decent happy hours and late night happy hour. during the weekdays they have special but we love to go on tuesday were their traditional wings are buy one get one free. is only for the snack and small size.
"i come here a lot for happy hours, so it's on point from that standpoint. if you get danielle or jessica, they are fantastic and will make your visit that much better. my dining and lunch experiences have always been good, but you may want to take caution with big groups for lunch. there has been some long waits on food, but its understandable when the place gets slammed for lunch hour. the facility is always clean; of course you have all the tvs everywhere; in the summer the garage style doors open and a nice patio is available."
i usually sit at the bar for a drink and order take out. the bartenders are friendly and the have a wide variety of craft beers. they even have kuhnenns (sp?) on tap from down the street!
the staff here was absolutely rude. server did not come back to check on us. took 15 mins to even get a drink order.
"disorganized and chaotic. i was put on hold twice within 10 minutes to call in my carry out order - 6 wings, blue cheese dressing, celery. the girl on the phone said it would be 10 minutes. cool beans.well, 10 minutes turned out to be 30. and i was surrounded by folks who were also waiting for carry out orders, some who had been waiting longer than  me. there was one employee to handle everything. utter chaos. this was about 4:30 on a friday afternoon, so the place wasn't packed.anyway, after returning to the car with my carry out order, i discovered i had only 5 wings. nothing like giving me 83% of what i paid for!! there was also 3 whopping celery sticks. sigh..... lesson learned. i enjoy bww, but this particular location leaves a lot to be desired."
"i went here for lunch today. it gets a clear 2. so, i shall start with the positive. i have been to bww many times before. and i heard that they started going downhill. i was skeptical and went here with several coworkers anyway. the wings were good, in fact great. the sauces were fine. i've had them many times. their prices are getting steeper. their menu no longer tells you how many wings are in a small, medium, large basket. that's sketch. that service, though...ouch. i ordered chips and salsa with my wings, and got fries. i was not the only one who received incorrect food. i'm chill, and i did not say anything. i will say to customers, ""dang, their fries are salty!"" jeesh, calm down on the salt!waitress never refilled our drinks for the 45 minutes we were there. i actually went up to the drink machine and got more water myself, and no one even noticed. the wait staff was clearly overworked, and to the point where everyone is getting crap service. this is clearly unacceptable. it took way too long to get the bill and pay. they automatically charged 18% for gratuity for parties 6 people or more. and normally i say that is very acceptable. but you better refill the glasses on that table every now and then. if you want the same quality of wings with good sides and much better service, hit up jimmy's tavern off of van dyke."
cdc just announced hepatitis a case. anyone that ate here from march 24 to april 9 should seek medical assessment.
"there is no other synonymous place for wings, beer and sports than buffalo wild wings. the undisputed king of a sauce game and there's no denying it. a lot of people come for tuesdays as their wings are roughly around 60cents each. yea they use to be 25 cents but that's back when the dinosaurs walked the earth and gas was $6 per gallon.here we had the 20 piece. they gave us 4 sauce to pick, so we went with the wild, mango habanero, honey bbq, and thai curry. cheese fries and nachos to share. not really impressed with the nachos, but you can't go wrong with the cheese fries. the wings are wings,, just like any buffalo wild wings, they're all quality controlled, so they all pretty much taste as similar as the other. plus i love their spicy wings. i killed the wild all to my self.service was pretty good. they took our orders, served our food hot and fresh, and our drinks servers iced cold. plus our waiter was exceptionally nice."
"this is our cheers! great service, food, and drinks!! ask for amy when you come in! she's an excellent server!"
this was definitely not the best experience i've ever had here. the food came out fairly quickly and it came out in a reasonably timely manner and the food was ok. the main complaint i had is the tvs we're all on games other than the lions game. it was a football sunday so i'm not sure why they wouldn't have the game on. i finally asked for it to be put on and my server told me he had to get the manager to do it. after some time it was put on one tv that was to the side of me so i had to  look over to see it and that was still the only tv in my area with the lions game on. the server again said the manager was delayed in the kitchen. upon leaving there was still only one tv with the lions game on that i could see from my booth.
horrible service! every time i call in for a carry out they always put me on hold for 10 mins. then when i come to pick up my order 15 mins later i still have to wait 20+ mins for just 6 wings!? obviously the employees here don't give a fuck about their jobs.
sat at the bar and got served fairly quickly which is understanding since there was no one else sitting at the bar. finished my first beer and waited for my food. ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich which didn't have hardly any buffalo sauce or ranch. so i thought to ask for some sauce to actually make it a buffalo ranch chicken sandwich like it was supposed to be. the bitch ass bar tender charged me for the damn sauce. i'm sure she'll wonder why she got zero tip at the end of my visit but maybe she will learn some customer service that most waitresses know already
"so i finally tried buffalo wild wings and i'm left feeling kind of meh. the atmosphere is what you would expect. sports bar like and loud. i had boneless wings (honey bbq & mango habanero) and fries. the fries were good and the sauce on the wings was also good. the wings themselves left a little to be desired for me. they're really really crunchy. i'd even say they were hard. it was also really expensive. it was over $20 for wings, fries and a pop. the celery and carrots are extra and if you add cheese and bacon to your fries they're like $8! i don't see what all the hype is about honestly."
love this place! great for a relaxing drink after a long day. staff is super nice and not pushy.
worst experience ever @ bww. horrible service. ordered shots of patron. it was house tequila. our server didn't pour them she said. so we asked for a new set. we didn't even drink them. so the server asks the manager to come over making a big deal about it. so we order different shots. they were so weak. like because we sent the first ones back they super skimped on the alcohol. then the server kept forgetting everything. she wrote nothing down. we asked for carrots and got celery.? the wings came out cold. asked for a game pad when we came in never got one. went to the bathroom both soap dispensers were completely out. then i asked a worker if someone could refill the soap in the restroom. 15 minutes later after i disassembled the whole soap disperser to get some soap. someone finally showed up to refill it. wows and then the manager still charged us for the shots. crazy
"i'm a pretty big fan of b-dubs in general, and this is one of the two i usually go to if i'm going. the staff is generally friendly, but they get extra points because the waitress pulled a hilarious prank on me, at the behest of my friends. any business that is willing to play along with jokes that will make me lose my mind is great in my book. additionally, i can't recall ever having had any complaints in the many years i've been coming here."
"this is a typical bwws. good food, tons of beer on draft and mediocre servers. the service is extremely hit or miss. most of the time we have to flag our server down for something but every once and a while they will actual bring us something without begging. but my expectations aren't very high when i come in so 3 stars it is."
"i have been to numerous bww restaurants, and i would have to rate this one the lowest. i usually come to this location because it is close to home, and just more convenient. the wings are usually what i come for, (boneless thursdays), and i would say that about 3 out of 5 times, i have to send them back because they are either too dry, or too cold. if you have the opportunity to visit buffalo wild wings, take it. just not this one."
"nice place. ordered a couple drinks - the twisted margarita is delicious. and the drinks aren't all that expensive either. only $7 for the margarita. their salads are good, as are their smiley fries - the smiley fries aren't on the menu, but you can still order them. however, there's a bouncer at the door past 8 pm and it appeared he let all the men in and only carded women. so that was a bit questionable... drinks and food are good, and our server was really nice too."
"i was so disappointed with my experience here. first, we were told it would be 30 minutes at the door by the security guard..then told 15 minutes by the hostess. so wasn't sure if they didn't want our business or not. we were seated within those 15 minutes however it took forever for our waitress to come see us. we had our order ready due to that length of time. it took twenty minutes to get our beer, we had gotten our appetizer out before that and it was cold. then we got our food..which was actually pretty good which is where the two stars come from.. but our waitress never came back to check on us at all.  never came to make sure everything was okay, nothing. it's frustrating when this is in such a popular location, you'd think that they'd have more safe and more urgency. i would highly suggest getting some active training in here. if you're coming to eat here, make sure you have some time and are not hangry because it will just make it worse."
"this is probably the worst bdubs that i have been too. when my family and i walked in there were many seats available. the host ask me how many people and i told him 5, he then told me it was going to be a 15-20 min wait? i questioned him, why is there a wait when i see about 4 booths opened? he then seated us immediately right after. laziness then we sat down. no one greatest us till about 15 minutes after and then we finally got our waters.we then ordered our food and it took us a while to get receive it? first i told him i had reward to claim which was the fried pickles and he stated all he needed was on phone number so that's all i gave him. our appetizer took about 20 minutes and our food took us another 20 minutes after, when it wasn't even busy? the appetizers were warm when they got to the table we had to ask our server for silverware and plateswhen our food came out, he put in a wrong order of fries instead of wedges. while eating my wings it took them another 20 min to get the wedges out because the order was wrong? we were already half way done eating by the time the wedges got to the table. we asked for ranch and blue cheese when we first ordered. only brought out 3 ranch for 5 people... so we requested more. took them another 10 minutes to receive only blue ranch when we asked for both. we didn't even bother asking him again our server was nice but i feel like either they were short staff, short cooks, or short runners i don't know what the issue was at this location.when we received our check they still charged me for the pickles! i had to get their attention again and then the manager said i had to claim my reward. then it would go through. first time using this, how am i suppose to know when all the server said was he needed a phone number. it took them another 10 minutes to change my bill. not satisfied. if you want slow warm food and bad service then i would come here."
"had the absolute worst & most distatsteful customer service experience after ordering takeout. called in to bww on our way home after discovering that the food we ordered was short 4 wings (we ordered through the website which states that a large traditional wing order would contain 18 wings). we thought informing the restaurant that our order was short 4 wings would be an easy fix. instead we were met with hostility and condescension by mark l. over the phone. one would expect for such a minor occurance an easy fulfillment of the 4 missing wings & maybe even some extra napkins. we instead were informed that the staff would have to check video footage (seriously?) & review documentation (we were already prepared to return with our receipt but i suppose that wouldn't be sufficient) to rectify the situation...the situation being the 4 wings that we paid for. we will not be returning to this establishment & are truly disheartened that what was about to be a night of  snacking with our children over a family movie at home turned into a very silent ride home writing this review & me preparing to still have to cook dinner! i encourage anyone else who considers this place to prepare themselves for potential losses & to even be presumed guilty (of ""lying"") if you call to inform them that the fries or wings you ordered and paid for are missing or not prepared in the way you read on the menu/website. & definitely encourage all to prepare themselves for the terrible dispositions of a condescending and embittered management."
"typical of the chain. the waitress we had was friendly and checked on us fairly often. the food was as good as one can expect. i do like that the have cottage fries (i think they call them buffalo chips). also like that they have grilled & unbreaded chicken strips (baked tenders). place is clean if a tad loud (20 tvs will do that. there were only one or two other tables with people when we were there, but in fairness, it was between lunch & dinner. while there is nothing that really stands out aside from over the top sports bar-grill joint, there is really nothing bad that would keep me from going back."
"this place needs to get their shit together, i ordered from doordash and they gave my order to the grubhub driver and then remade my order wrong. this is not the first time i've had an issue."
"this is without a doubt my favorite place for sports and wings. in fact, i'm a stock holder of bww. i would love to give this a better score but it's terribly difficult to do so.  please allow me to explain..when you walk in, you are blocked from the rest of the restaurant by a 12 foot tall hostess stand. which is never staffed, and no one can see you standing there waiting. very frustrating.i'm still a huge fan of the wings, but no matter how many times i visit the service is so slow it makes my visits less frequent and highly frustrating. if you are a member of the blazin rewards app, very rarely can you get your receipt to load onto the app for some reason or another.  i still go here, but with lower expectations than what i would prefer.  hopefully things turn around soon - and they remove this hostess stand that no one can see around!"
"this location is really good at customer service. we received our food really fast and our server was attentive and made sure our water didn't get below 3/4 empty. the food was hot, made correctly, and was really good!"
great promotions during the week! friendly staff...they got me hooked on blazin rewards. best way to get free food!love this place!
"the worst place ever. it was always somewhat marginal, but you have managed to make shit service and shit product your calling. i cannot even begin to tell you how freaking horrible this place is. ok, here is an example. my flight was late getting in. thought i would stop and grab carry out. not too difficult of a task. so i ordered a small with buffalo dry seasoning. no dressing, just veggies. after 15 minutes, it comes out. bear in mind, the place has maybe 5 groups of people. i don't bother looking at it since it is really freaking hard to screw up a simple order. i even tipped. stupid is as stupid does. anyhow. i get home and am looking forward to my wings. wtf. my wings are peeking out from under a box full of seasoning. i pour most of it out and actually wash my gd wings to get the excess seasoning off. still i cannot get it off. i have had this same order 10x at other bww. but no, you sh-bags cannot get it right. the picture is my last 2 wings and what i scraped off of them. you guys suck. oh, the icing on the cake, zero freaking veggies and two freaking containers of dressing. if we were not getting a big snowstorm tomorrow, i would bring them back and demand a refund. bad bad bad. hey manager, if you want to make it right, you can contact me through here."
"it's pretty good. aside from parking is a bit of a nightmare in the area. i'm not really going to blame this establishment for it. because you are in royal choke and you chose to come here. so that's that!typical buffalo wild wings stuff. city style, so there's a bouncer in the front door asking for everyone's id. after that, there was a bit of a wait over at the host's booth. my friends said they've been waiting for a bit and they're not even full. i told them, maybe they're outside having a quick cigarette,, i dunno... eventually we were seated.anyways, same menu as your neighborhood buffalo wild wings. you can get their traditional wings with the sauces and dry rubs. then there's their limited time special sauce, the scorpion rum. dubbed as their spiciest sauce (even spicier than blazin), an order does come with vanilla ice cream just to help with the heat. so, i order and i eat.the flavors were definitely better than blazin, but the heat tho. it was pretty proper, first wing was good, second wing will actually put you over.service was pretty good,, over all cleanliness of the restaurant was exceptional. attentiveness of the staff was pretty good as well. i would definitely come back here and eat again.thank you for reading my review. i hope this helps. enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!"
"i went here last night with my friend for a drink. when we got to the door we were immediately carded. the man that carded us seemed very grumpy and we didn't understand why. as we sat and ate dinner we noticed he only carded women. this made us very mad. we ordered salads, as well as drinks we thought looked good on the menu. i ordered an atwater dirty blonde, and my friend ordered a fruitier frozen drink. the salads were good. the fries were good. our waitress was super nice and very attentive. would go back here again...despite the seemingly sexist card check at the door."
"ordered through grub hub, they were late on the delivery, food was soggy, the order was wrong. they did refund me for the order of wings but as for the mac n cheese and potatoe wedges they were pretty bad. i would not recommend delivery, maybe dining in would be better?"
"i'm very disappointed. we ordered bw3 from grub hub this evening. it wasn't that large of an order. $59 the delivery man just left and the only food delievered was my kids meals (which is great because i'd rather their food come than mine). my husband and i did not receive our medium order of wings and fried  pickles. i called grub hub for assistance and was told that bw3 told themthey couldn't redeliver our food! that is very poor customer service in my opinion. you only sent half our order and then tell me you wont redeliver? disappointing. if i could give you 0 stars i would. we frequent your royal oak location quite often but now i'm going to rethink our dinner choice. also, my kids food wasn't very warm either."
"awful take-out service! we were told 25-30mins so arrived at that time and waited over a hour at the restaurant for the wings. when asked repeatedly how much longer the staff and manager said ""i'm not sure we're really busy."" terrible service and customer care. the easiest order too- large boneless wings. i understand busy sunday, but don't say 25 mins say accurate time to pick up."
"i came in with my grandfather after work on the day after labor day. we were served by lee, he was incredibly attentive and very helpful with the specials. lee was to the point but very hospitable. we will return!"
"runnnnnnnnnnnnnn !!!!!!!! ryan woods general manager, how can u tell a paying customer that they cannot have their food cooked no longer then 16 minutes when the chicken is clearly mushy and under cooked not well done but atleast done. you were very rude and made our guest very unwelcome almost closet racist with your approach. i'm not illiterate i can read a sign no well done but atleast done damn it"
horrible service. concierge staff short & curt with response. had zero interest in listening to customers. too cool for school. we left before being seated.
"the cooks are not consistent. i ordered nachos and they were outstanding one day and i reordered them a week later and they completely messed everything up. they left off lettuce, picco de gallo and jalapeños. what did i pay for?"
this place deserves 0 stars. i have made the mistake and given this place 3 tries and each time it's been awful every tine.
"b-dubs is probably the only reigning king in the chicken wings game atm. it's always a good idea since we can get beer, watch some sports and eat some wings at the same time. that and hanging out with your favorite buddies.this place is pretty good. located right at the heard of the dearborn strip, it not hard to miss this location. plus there's plenty of parking in the back of the restaurant.the wings are pretty standard. all of their restaurants are quality controlled, so they'll all have the same taste. service was rather lacking here though. it's either the kitchen or the servers that's taking quite a bit of time to serve drinks and food. also, i can ding the bar as well. two of my cousins ordered a snake bite, one was served perfectly with the two different color liquids separated in the middle. the other one, did not even look like they tried. oh well right?oh they do have a lovely dining room setting though.thank you so much for reading my review. i hope this helps with your decision making experience. enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!"
"it would have been a definite five star but had to take one out because we had to wait 45 mins total of seating and trying to get a service. wow! i know, it's such a bummer especially when the store isn't even busy. the food overall was great. once we got our orders in, it took about 15 mins to get them to your table. it's funny how i've consumed buffalo wild wings but have never actually dine in....great location, right by where all the other restaurants are. if you are looking for parking, head over to the parking garage about a block away and it's free!"
"i have always had a good experience at this bww. but maybe because is never busy when my husband and i come. we always order wings and fries. we have only sent the fries back once cuz they were over cooked but other than that nothing wrong w the food.service has never been strong at this location but getting my food correct and in a fast manner i think it doesn't matter. to me is just another fast food restaurant.desserts is a sad story because  none of them are good. the chocolate cake is always so cold. we just end up going to the nearest ice cream shop. beer is pricy if it's not on special! i know they have happy hr after 10 pm and somewhere in between.i feel like you have to always go to a bww with no high expectations, hence why we never had a bad experience."
"normally the service here is horrendous but i enjoy the chicken wings so i stick it out, but this time we got lucky. mariah was out waitress and she was amazing! otherwise, this location isn't my first choice but it's near by. chicken wings are great and so are the fries, as far as the other stuff i haven't really tried much. sweet bbq, honey bbq, chipotle, medium, and salt & vinegar are all great sauces. all are dairy free & so are the boneless wings !!!! fyi* boneless wings are .60 cents on thursdays and i believe in bone wings are the same in tuesday? (don't quote me on that last one)."
"great food, vibes, and service!the service was exceptional and the waitress made sure everything was made correct and very good"
worst service ever. it is not packed and we had to wait 45 mins just for water. then another hour for food.
"a decent meal.i went for lunch with a friend. the restaurant was clean and the service prompt. i had spicy garlic wings with a side salad, blue cheese for both. the salad was quite big for a side salad, and enjoyable. the wings were good. not great, but definitely worth the time and money. the blue cheese was a disappointment, but not bad. my friend had boneless wings, mild, with a caesar salad, and said his was about the same.it's not worth a drive, but if you're in the area and have a hankering for some wings, you won't be disappointed."
"this has got to be the worst bdubs i have been too. it's incredible how bad the service is! we asked for carrots and celery.. which normally i don't ask for it and it comes with what i order. even after asking for it.. we didn't get it. my friend asked for her side salad first.. it came 15 mins after her boneless chicken wings.. another friend ordered the black bean burger.. but there was a ""malfunction"" with it and her food came out 10 mins after everyone else's.. i never got a refill on my water which is crazy.. i know this  is a chain and i have been plenty of times.. it was my first time at this particular restaurant.. i would go back to other locations but not this one."
"this is a place to go if you are feeling like watching a whole bunch of sports and don't feel like conversing if in a large group. the place gets loud making it difficult to talk to a person if they are not sitting right next to or just across from you. surprisingly the food usually is not too bad, but the last two times i've gone and ordered the boneless wings they were subpar. the first time they were over cooked with too much breading. i figured hey everyone deserves a mulligan right so i tried them again. well they were a bigger miss than the first time. this time it looked like i got the bottom on the bag! the wings were not only over cooked tiny bits, but this was time there were also just small breaded chunks mixed in. for a place that has ""wings"" in the name you would figure that their wing would be good."
"good chicken wings, with different sauces and seasonings to pick from. i have to say, a bit too salty. i get it, it's the seasoning, still way too salty. i mostly stop by because my brother is a big fan. this dearborn location is nice, clean, and have a good atmosphere. plenty of the service is good and quick."
great spot to watch some football games with great food! we always like to shit near the bar area because that's where mostly all the tvs are. the wings were pretty good. service was on point. waitress kept checking on us. try the garlic parmesan wings and the asian zing
it's nasty. take my word for it. the service is terrible. the meat is full antibiotics. it's all really disgusting and should be illegal.
this restaurant has the worst chicken wings at any eatery with a reputation. when my wings came from the bar they were dry and about the size of my small pinky. i asked to see the manager and he did not charge me for the wings but i was still hungry. why are they serving these wings? the bartenders are not too attentive to their customers that sit alone at the bar. the girl bartender was more concerned with her tiny parties to refill my coke that was empty for 13 minutes. the fries were greasy and disgusting. another time i came with family and we all ordered wings and salads. once again the wings were heavily sauced and the meat on the wings was lacking. another visit with a group of male friends was also a disgusting evening of horrible food. the bartender thought she was too cute to be more attentive. lots of bragging with the other servers. the clientele was very intimidating and lacked manners. a type of hoodlum mentality echoed through the restaurant. this place needs some serious security at night.  i would strongly suggest another restaurant to all new patrons. i would never-ever go back there!
"the dearborn location is a  joke. thursday is boneless wing day, tried to order on the app, the unpleasant manager amanda said you couldn't use the app at that location and they only offer a few sizes.  it also took really long for our order to come out, 23 minutes to be exact.  again, snarky comment from the manager ""it's only been 20 minutes""...no smile or sorry ....laughable customer service, the other people waiting couldn't believe that was a manager.  she really shouldn't be and i'll be telling that to corporate tomorrow...i wouldn't waste my time or money there again."
"my family and i went to this location 6/16/18. i have to tell ya they don't train these young kids on customer service. they just hire you because you have a pulse nowadays. our waitress savannah was the worst. no smile, no sense of humor, no personality. just going through the motions. she looked like the terminator without being efficient at her job. didn't check on us. when we ask for something, she'd bring it, slide on the table and walk away. not a here ya go can i get you anything else. i love tipping great service and it pains me that i won't tip if you suck. but it's your responsibility to give me a great experience. i hope you read this savannah because here's some tips to increase your money. smile, compliment a woman's purse or nails, speak to kids and call them adorable, always be apologetic even when it's not your fault, check on your customers and ask if they need anything. you walk past and look over to us and assumed we needed nothing because we didn't stop you. you ask us mam. when you bring something that we ask for, you're supposed to set it on the table with a smile and say here you go and ask if we need anything else. bring napkins and boats for bones without being asked. that could have been 20.00 in your pocket from me, instead you got nothing because in my eyes you did nothing. i'm a shuttle driver and a customer service specialist. that's why i know these things. i wanna give the people at taco bell a tip because there service is excellent. there management cares. bdubs could careless. i didn't see one manager walk the floor. first and last time we're ever going to this location. have a criteria for your employees bdubs before you hire them. check for a good upbeat personality."
loved this place. the interior was amazing. the feel of the place was really interesting and the food was wonderful. service was alright. not very attentive but the wings definitely made up for it!
staff need hella help our waitress has stupid my glass was crack so she examined my cup for 2 minutes and the guy that brought my food to my table dropped my food on the table instead of kindly setting it down ‍‍‍
"i guess i didnt expect stellar food or service when we stopped to eat here...it is a buffalo wild wings afterall. however, my dinner there last week was far worse than i could have expected. food was normal, exactly what you would expect. the service was awful. our drink and food orders came out incorrectly, and the manager did not even seem to be apologetic. it was actually funny to her that she was wasting our time and money! wont be going back here ever again. i will eat subpar wings elswhere"
i finally found a wings place with wonderful service. the waiter was fast and very nice. the food was fantastic and delicious. definitely coming here again.
"still coming here for lunch once a week, since my last review the wait times have improved considerably. the service is still great, i'm usually part of a large group and the waitresses are always very attentive."
met my hubby here for lunch after not having been to a bww in 10+ years.   started with a strawberry lemonade which while pricy was soooo good.  not too sweet which some lemonades tend to be.  and it had real fruit in it.  a must try.  had the wings which were on special for i believe 75 cents a wing which ended up being a better price than the $7.99 fast break lunch deal which we were told only had 5 wings.  the wings were small but tasty.  good sauces.  i had the sweet bbq which was really good.  the fries were nice and crispy and they were the skinnier ones almost like shoestring fries which i love.  the hubby had salt and vinegar fries (dry rub) which were waaaay top seasoned.  i preferred my pain fries as did my husband.  we were in and out in under an hour which is a plus when you have to hurry back to work.  i'd try them again in the future.
"i had an early supper this afternoon at buffalo wild wings in the devonshire mall.there were lots of flavours of wings to choose from ... i got mine with lemon pepper spice.  i got ranch dressing (rather than blue cheese) for my carrots. the wings were good.  they were salty, peppery and lemony.  i'd get them again.damion was my server.  he was friendly, efficient and took good care of me."
the waiters are nice and enthusiastic.but it takes a long time to wait for the meal.it tastes good but contains too much calories.
"food, booze, and sports! what a recipe for a good night! i love coming to buffalo wild wings when i get the chance to. the customer service is beyond stellar! the bartender (can't remember his name but he's the taller one) always knows my order before i sit down. helps that i get the same thing all the time lol. pretty much the only question that needs to be asked is how many patties i'm getting on my burger. favourite meal is always the big jack daddy burger with sweet potato fries and a twisted tea. honestly can't wait to come back to bww for my next outing! just hope it's before the end of the stanley cup playoffs!"
my daughter wanted to come here for supper yesterday. we went and it was dead but it took nearly 15 minutes for someone to seat us. a waitress looked at us but yet no one came. we were about to leave when someone finally come out to seat us. our waitress was great but the fact that it took so long to be seated and another man was waiting to pick up his take out even before we got there and no one acknowledged him. not even an apology to us or the man waiting for a long time.
"woo hoo! they have a lot of tvs! to put this into perspective they have more tvs than windows.the place was empty but we had an early lunch...i am not sure if it gets busier or if people are scared off by the over priced beer.we had lunch and sat in the restaurant part. the staff were very accommodating to my child. they gave him an ipad to play games on, crayons and a cool cup of water which he actually drank a lot of!  i was really impressed with the menu. we started with delicious sam adams draft beers which sadly costed me an arm and a leg...a whopping $7.95! that is absolutely outrageous. it was the third most expensive beer on the menu. heineken was the most expensive which was $8.95 for 20 ounces of draft beer.  the food prices were much more reasonable. my husband ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich which was loaded with shredded lettuce, two slices of tomato and two rings of red onion and cheese. he ordered yam fries with a southwest ranch. everything went very well together and i would totally order this sandwich again   i ordered beef sliders off the lunch express menu for $10 and shared them with my son. it came with a side and i selected nachos and salsa.   i wasn't impressed with the salsa. i prefer a fresher home made salsa like a pico de gallo. if i were to go back i would ask to swap out the salsa for pico de gallo.  the slider was a bit dissapointing. the patti was thin and reminded me of a cheap wendy's junior burger and bun. i would not order the sliders again."
just so so. wings good. we had two varieties. also ordered a burger with fries. fries were only warm. wait staff was good to switch channel on one of the tv's to the masters final round. not sure if i would go back.
"bar environment. food was just ok. a little cold and took forever to be delivered. pricing on bar food is too high. $13 for a chicken sandwich and onion rings. $40 for two with no beer or cocktails. expensive for a supposedly quick lunch. service was the best part. plenty of servers but the kitchen seems like it needs some help. better for the wings than the sandwich, but bull & barrel has the best wings in town. i'd come back for the convenient location."
great food and great prices but lately it seems the service is a hit or miss. i come here weekly and twice this week they have messed up orders at my table. not only did they seem to not care but the manager never comes to apologize like proper management should. really need to train your management team. but beside the fact some waiters are amazing and food is good.
"good service, fun environment. love the tvs. great to watch a sports game at. love that you can choose boneless, and either wing or drum.get the garlic parmesan flavour!!my friends (shoutout to m.m. and s.t.) didn't love their flavours though, so i'm hesitant to say all their flavours are as good."
expensive. food sub par. service helter skelter. the one star rating is i was treated.
these were not wings. their version of a boneless wing is a little square of white meat coated in batter and fried. nothing like a wing and not the taste. service was pleasant but the food took a very long time to get to us. there were only about 4 tables in the restaurant and still was slow. over priced beer too. might be better if you hit them during a happy hour if they have one.
worse food ever!!! nachos were as if our waitress went back an made them herself (no toppings). my southwest philly was described as prime rib on a hoagie roll an was really minced hamburger meat on a d'italiano bun which btw fell apart when you picked it up. my wife's byou poboy was said to be loaded with crispy chicken an was really 2 dried out chicken fingers on also a hotdog bun. an now onto their dried out smallest so called chicken wings hence the company's name were the worst ever. an for the price... really?? won't be returning
"i love this place! it's a great place to eat with your friends and watch sports. the food is great and the service is my favourite part. i love the boneless wings to death and my favourite dish is the ultimate bacon cheeseburger (which i recommend) all the servers i had were respectful, funny, or just joyful. i don't understand how people dislike this place but it is for people into sports, nothing romantic or family friendly in my opinion. but it's okay in my book."
love the tvs there! perfect wings fries and salad! definitely a good place to catch up with some friends !
worst service i've experienced in a while. cold wings with insultingly small size. wrong dipping sauce. cold fries. and the waiter disappeared.
"i am really not impressed with this place. i have to start off by saying i can't eat chicken, so i had to choose something other than their specialty, which is fine. i got their black and bleu burger, to go. the gentleman on the phone said about 15 minutes. we got there in roughly that amount of time, and had to wait an additional 20 minutes or so in the lobby waiting for our food. when i did get to eat it, it was disappointing. the fries are pretty much mcdonald's fries without any salt. the bun on the burger was super stale and the tomatoes were white. this on top of a burger patty that looks like something you'd get out of a frozen box of them in a grocery store. is it too much to ask to make your own burger patties? i'm sure their wings are good, but as far as burgers go, you're way better off going to somewhere else, especially for the price."
"i hate to admit it, but they are my favourite local wings at the moment. i think i've ordered wings to go at least once a week since they have opened. the wings have been thoroughly cooked each time i order from there. unfortunately, i can't give them 5 stars because their side dishes are always cold (when you get them for takeout). they need different containers for their takeout side dishes."
the food was ok nothing special ive had better wings at a local restaurant and it ended up being $80 for lunch of 3 people maybe 15 wings each - definitely not worth the price point and we went on canada day and it was overwhelming and very sports bar like. dont think we will be returning
i had my birthday dinner at this fine place and the waitress who served us was such a sweetheart and i thank u for the clean cup by the way lol
"great spot! i had a small issue and paul, the general manager, was very accommodating. he was very friendly and hospitable, i would recommend this place for anyone looking to get your wing fix."
"absolute trash. they have some kind of a bouncer/security people at the front of a bww -- manager was waiting at the front said that the bar area was 'full' and nobody was allowed to come in as i tried to walk in to get food... at the bar really?after 5-6 people strolled through (all black and one of her friends), i said ""well, it looks like its not full"" -- she immediately got snippy and angry as you would expect from an overweight person of her enthinicity and said ""you is welcome to go stand around in the bar area if you want"" -- walked over to the bar and there were 5-6 open seats and open tables everywhere in the bar area. waited about 5 minutes for the bartender to even notice me and said she would 'be right back'i left and on my way out the manager said ""see,  i told you it was full""i said ""no, not full at all, not sure what kind of selective racism or bs you are trying to run being a 'bouncer' in a sports bar when there are seats open, but your place sucks""people give detroit a bad reputation but unfortunately in 2018, its real and this place is racist and total trash. no thanks"
"the management and service here is so disorganized and chaotic. we came here last night to eat a quick bite before heading home. it was not busy in there at all but they said if wanted to sit in the dining room there would be a wait. we were confused because it was not busy. we decided to sit in the bar area because it was not busy either and there was not a wait. we sat down, there were multiple servers running around and cleaning tables. after about 15 minutes we asked for menus. we received menus. then we waited for about 20 minutes and started asking random servers if we could place an order. a waitress came and said she wasn't our waitress but let us place our order with her because she couldn't find our waitress. our food took forever. we only got 1 pretzel appetizer and 2 snack size orders of wings. we debated on leaving. as we were going to leave, our food showed up. it was the longest evening there. we are not sure why it took so long. all waitresses and management were just walking around cleaning and not helping people. i do not think i will return to this location or if you order food, order it to go. on our way out, we saw that the dining room was still empty and the waiting area was completely full of people waiting to be seated. everyone did not look happy. also, my bill was 9.00 and i had a coupon on blazing rewards for 3 dollars off which would bring my bill to 7 dollars. i gave my waitress 10 dollars. she returned and said the coupon came off and didnt give me my change. she ran away quickly. the 2 others at my table did not receive their change either, i do not think the service or food was worth my 3 dollar ""tip"". definitely not returning."
"manager told employees not to seat anyone, multiple dirty tables, waited for a half hour on my lunch break.get it together."
"the best thing about this place is the abundance of tv screens.  the service was good but slow even allowing for it being sunday.  there were 4 of us.  we order one order of wings. one boneless, tater tots and fries.  typical bar food.  completely over saused; to the point where things were not edible.  the tater tots were awful and i love tater tots. they didn't look a thing like the menu picture.  i ended up eating around the abuse as best that i could.  getting them redone was really out of the question.  our server although very pleasant was hard to find and left us chasing down refills and the check.  clearly we were out of towners, but i dont think they treat the locals any better.  sadly we stopped at 3 other local places on the way here looking for a bar with the nfl total ticket.  this is no go for a repeat. sorry but this place needs wings and a prayer.  it's a miss."
so i'm up here with my loving wife and i must say that 2stars is all i will give this establishment first off the bartender was rude just throwing our napkins and straws around but yet she's nice to her regulars talking about kid rock and just now she just told a customer to ring up their own drink and yet felicia the supervisor is condoning it and now she is getting smart with another customer this is sad now if you don't like serving people of color then i'd sinus's that you work out in monroe michigan or niles michigan oh yeah did i mention she could not even make my drink right smhwe won't be back
terrible service. extremely slow. frustrating in fact. went on a dinner with colleagues. one colleague had to wait 30mins for his wings while everyone was eating their food
"ordered food for pick up. it was a disorganized mess when i got there even though i received an email 5 minutes prior telling me my order was ready for pick up. i only received 2 side of ranch for my 4 orders of wings, even though i asked for extra ranch with each. didn't get any of my celery. one side of wings was supposed to be sauce on the side only and that didn't happen. they gave us 1 set of utensils even though we have 4 peoples orders on here. this was a mess that they called service didn't get any better from the quality of the food. even though we had to wait when we arrived, the food wasn't even warm anymore by the time we got back to work, a 5 minutes drive away."
"this place has the worst service on earth. i would even put it high in the rating for worst in the milky way, pending proof of alien discovery.first of all, we sat in an area with 11 tables being served by four staff. we weren't seen for 30 mins after we asked the manager and another busboy for service. we were about to be on our way out when our server arrived.once we were, my colleague ordered the grilled chicken salad on the menu and it came without...you guessed it...chicken! wtf!  after waiting 40 mins after everyone ate, he finally got his over cooked rubbery chicken. they also didn't serve his soda with ice...he got the ice with his chicken, lol, seriously.kitchen staff were out trying to visit with the waitresses. waitresses speed was best measured on a geological time scale. it took us 3 hours, almost 4, start to finish. the person at the table next to us knew her waitresses name and had to go to the kitchen to ask for the check. tvs are nice except the biggest one, which is dark and blurry. slow clap here.the manager here looked helpless...no control over staff.  just avoid at all cost. i go to great bws around my house all the time, and this review is not based on them as a whole....avoid this one at all costs."
i been to detroit couples of times and two of my visits i came here to eat at buffalo wild wings and food is great here. when i get to downtown it's always pretty late and buffalo wild wings are always open late. i don't like how most of all the restaurants in detroit buffalo they close before 8... but i sticked with buffalo wild wings. the food was good and service was good.
how can you not have any celeries when you are a chicken wing place or is my server too lazy to get it for me after she mixed up my request for celery only to carrots only?  worst bww i have ever visited.
"beer, wings and a friendly bar tender...nuff said."
"i'd give no stars if possible waited over 45 minutes for my food and they weren't busy. never received a refill, our glasses sat empty most of the time we were there as we watched our server take care of his other table who came in after us and ate. asked for a manager never got one. ended up asking for my food to go and received no silverware or napkins. waited 10 minutes at the register to pay my bill and nobody came with my bill. wouldn't go back to this location"
"avoid at all costs! if you want horrible service and a non-local spot, go here. if you want better, literally go anywhere else. (i've been here a few times and all similar experiences)good local spots in the area -sweetwater (much better classic wings)-jacobys (good local beer selection + german food)-any of the greek restaurants in greektown (good greek food)-firebird tavern (good local beer selection and same kind of food)"
"the food is good, when you get it, and assuming it's actually warm.abysmal service most of the time.yet i can't stay away."
if i could give zero stars i would! my partner and i brought two of our youth here to eat after a long day of them volunteering and helping renovate a new community center in southwest detroit. once we sat down the manager flies by and tells one of our black young men to take off his hood... mind you other men are wearing hats and beanies... later we see this manager go to another table with a man with the same type of hood on and he doesn't say anything at all. this racist manager needs to have a culture competency training and doesn't need to work in detroit if he's threatened by a black 15 year old boy. so disgusting.
"came here with a party of 6 for lunch. we were on a time limit so we figured we would take advantage of their ""15 minute guarantee"" lunch... 35 minutes later, still no food. every table that came after us got their food. we had to go so we asked for our food to go. we asked for the manager and he came out to speak to us, he offered vouchers for the inconvenience. on top of that, it took an additional 10 mins. it defeated the whole purpose of coming. upon checkout, i specially asked for their lunch salad. they charged me for the dinner and i told the waitress that i ordered from the lunch. she still charged me full price. my friend spent $30 on her meal and didn't even get her food. terrible and such a disappointment."
"just went there, only about 25% of tables occupied, sign says seat youself, sat in middle of room, no occupied tables nearby, waited 10 minutes with servers passing by table 4-5 times, even making eye contact but not acknowledging, greeting, or asking if i was served.  non-server person said someone would get me a menu right after i sat down, she came again just as i got up to leave and asked if i had been served. i told her no and i was done. she apologized but that was too little too late.  wild wings has lost my business for the foreseeable future; their loss, i travel 40+ weeks a year and i like wings!!!"
some call gordon ramsey from kitchen nightmares! this is the worst service i ever encountered in my life! our server leo came back and asked us what we wanted to drink 3 times. all we asked for was water with lemon. 15 mins later he came back with water without lemon. i ordered a crispy chicken sandwich. he told me they ran out of the chicken  like what!
"if your not a lions fan, don't represent your team in this place. i got treated like i had leprosy! the waitress even had the nerve to mumble under her breath that i had the wrong jersey on! they took forever to bring me my food, and when they finally brought it, it wasn't even all of it and it was burnt! i thought this was a sports bar where you can go watch sports and have a decent meal. not here. plus the staff had a fight in the back and someone threw the hot pepper seasoning at another employee and it exploded causing it to waft throughout the restaurant making the patrons cough and gag and sneeze and leave! clearly the worst buffalo wild wings i have ever been to. don't waist your time or money in this place. it's a huge disappointment."
"as a chain is expected to be, it feels like the normal. i had been greeted by a gentleman that ended up being the bartender. chris, the bartender is the exact example of a person i would want working for me if i had a business. i hate to say that he had a salesmanship that made me rethink stuff that i haven't even though i wasn't sure i even wanted, but he did. great experience. we have been to several bdubs and dreaded going back. this time it made a huge impact on our thought process. makes you think about what you're business is and want to be the face of your establishment."
"went for 430 football this past sundayokay here it is, i have been here numerous times for mostly football games. the service is mediocre and it's understandable with how busy this place gets.it's everything you expect out of a generic corporate food box.yes they have a ton of sauce options for the wings. but everything's in paper cups making me feel like i'm just grazing like a pig.i mean at least get small plates for apps and what not.yes there are over 1,000 tvs at every possible angle and no complaints with seating. but jeez, can't stress the food here. been bothering me for a while. indigestion is one thing. but the sense of having made a guilty choice is overwhelming.i don't know how freshly made everything is, for some reason all our food goes cold and stale within minutes of delivery.burgers were okay and i won't be too bitter about their fries. in fact they have their french fry game mastered.i like to yelp but not to just be a salty critic. my small crew of food and football fans are going to have to try alternatives around the area. sure we will take a hit not having 1,000 game options. but ya know, maybe less is better."
"i stopped in for a bite to eat with a friend prior to a movie. i ordered the small boneless wings with medium sauce, which came with 12 (a meal for most!) and southwestern ranch & honey bbq dipping sauces. the medium had a really nice kick to it, and the wings were tasty.i ordered a twisted margarita, with no salt or sugar on the rim. the first one i got was good, but then she asked me if i wanted another one and i said yes, but this time it came out with salt on the rim, and some salt had gotten in the drink, which made it tough to drink. i sucked it up and drank about half of it, but should have sent it back. our server was ok, she did her job, but nothing exceptional.there are several things on the menu that i would like to try, so i'll definitely be back at some point, but i'm not going to make a point to go there just to go there--i will most likely pop in after some shopping in clifton park center. i will say this, the location is great and the parking is good."
"your experience here will really depend on who you get as a waiter/waitress. i only ever come on boneless thursdays because the wings are fairly cheap that day and to early-celebrate the weekend. some days, there are only a few people in the bar area and service is still slow. other days, it's still pretty fast even if there are a lot of other customers. there is one waitress there who's really nice, talkative, makes you feel welcome. another who is curt, blunt, and makes me never want to eat there again. recently got a new hire who never knew when to start talking and we just had a ton of awkward silences when he'd ask us a question, we'd answer, and then he'd take another minute of standing there before either going away or asking a follow-up. food is okay. again, i mostly come for the wings and they're fine. there's a few sauces that they consistently don't provide a lot of on your wings; you just have to know which ones. i got popcorn shrimp a while back and there was a lot of it. on a return trip, i tried popcorn shrimp again and this time, got very little. i asked the waitress if i got a wrong dish since there were so few shrimp on my plate. she told me she's been working there for a while now and it has always been that little. well..she lied to my face because i've also been going there for 3 years now and it wasn't that little to begin with or else i wouldn't have ordered it again. will still continue to come here because wings. and if you see my pictures, i got 10 wings (1 extra for each sauce) when i asked for 8 so that was great. but nature has a balance and one of the extra wings turned out to be a dud and rock solid so i couldn't even poke at/through it with my fork. you win some, you lose some."
"the food was ok. the atmosphere was noisy with a ton of screens everywhere showing sports. the waiters where attentive and fast. not a great place, just good."
love this place. great thai curry wings. boom.there is room for improvement. for example the broken paper towel holder has been broken for at least 2 weeks. time to step it up and either replace it for fix it. gross and lazy.
"i don't think i could ever come here again. being a fan of the chain restaurant, this is probably one of the worst i've come to. two appetizers, one large boneless and two medium boneless meals, along with three drinks (soda), came to $93. if the food had been decent it would have been okay, however two of the meals were not even up to lukewarm. the waitress had no problems waiting on us but she had an attitude the entire time. the establishment was clean and atmosphere was good, however i have to give it two stars based on the cold chicken and waitress."
"clean bathrooms, varying degree of service, and standard food. the wings are crispy, then slathered in sauce like most buffalo wild wing franchises. the burgers are mediocre - the beef is underwhelming and almost metallic tasting, but aren't bad once they're slathered with toppings such as crispy onions or pulled pork. the buns are always nicely toasted though, so that's a plus."
"the worst experience i have ever had. i'm writing this review as i wait for my food/drinks. i've been here for 1 hour and have not received my food. i ordered my drink and 20 minutes passed and i decided to just go to the bar to order my drink. the bar tender didn't know how to make a cadillac margarita so she googled it. then she said she didn't have the ingredients. so, 1 hr later, i got my food. no, it was not busy! there was about 20 customers in the restaurant. the servers were chilling and watching tv! wth!!! worst experience ever!"
stopped in with some friends.  the place was quite busy due to a hockey game being aired.  it appeared that the place was setup to show the game but had tvs on other assorted sports items.  i am a sucker for good chicken wings and they did not disappoint. but even with high volume i expect a cleaner environment.  there was junk on the table and on the floor.  i am not a princess but really?  we had never been to this location but like other reviews it seems like the wait staff is inconsistent.  prices are what to expect by this chain.
"for a company that prides itself on its wings, they're really not that great. frozen out of the bag stuff reheated at your direction. they'll toss them in some sugary sauces and i guess we're supposed to call that food. it ain't cheap either. wings and a tap beer cost me $20. i'll give them credit for being open late, but not much else."
food came out cold after waiting forever for it and there was two other people there. would not recommend going in late at night
we waited here an hour for our food. food is subpar and service was poor. very disappointing experience.
"came in here tonight after dinner to watch the yankees play (sadly they lost) with family the night before an out-of-town wedding. the service was stellar; nick, our server, was extremely friendly and helpful, coming around often to ensure we were enjoying the evening and had everything we needed. josh, the captain, also came by to say hello and make sure all was well.although we'd had a great dinner elsewhere, we ordered deep fried pickles and boneless wings. nick did a sauce tasting for us so we could choose the sauce we wanted. i didn't have any wings, but i heard they were delicious. the deep fried pickles-i wasn't even hungry but had to try one (and ended up eating a good deal of them) were the right combo of crispy outside and crunchy dill pickle inside. the cornmeal batter had the right amount of spice as well. i tried the ranch dip that came with them-it had a smoky heat to it, but mostly i ate them in their plain glory.i'd ordered the ginger margarita and it was one of the best mixed drinks i've had in a long time. it was ginger spicy and delicious.my mom and i played the bar trivia most of the evening, which was fun, too. all in all a great experience at this location."
"we went back again last night and ordered wings and a side caesar salad. the wings were, of course, excellent. the salad was terrible. the dressing reminded me of the taste of lettuce/mayo on a bk whopper... slimy, strangely sweet... and the croutons were very dry. for $4.50 before tax we expected better. our waitress removed it from our bill and confided that ""all of our salads aren't very good."" i appreciate the honesty, though advising us of it beforehand would have been better.bww still keeps its 5-star review as a wing joint, but i would strongly recommend you not order one of their caesar salads unless you already have tried them and know you like them."
"this was our first time at buffalo wild wings and i was not impressed! i'm giving it two stars because i like our waiter and the food came promptly, other than that they were over priced and gave skimpy portions, especially for the price. the wings were not up to par as they should be and we order 15 wings for about $15.95 that's over a dollar per wing . they do their orders by fives and your allowed to pick one sauce per each five wings. the wraps come with chips and salsa and they have an up charge if you want fries, which i think is ridiculous. most likely we won't be going back!"
so today i ordered online and the site said pick up 1040.  at  1050 i was told it would be another 5 minutes. i ordered at 1015 now 40 minutes later  they still need more time?!? wtf.
"i recently ordered dinner for myself and a few guests from the clifton park store. after placing an order for delivery i waited approximately 90 minutes before calling the store to find out the driver had not yet arrived to pick up my food from the restaurant. the staff at buffalo wild wings then blamed grubhub and their delivery driver for not being on time, i was told the driver would call me to give me an update on the order shortly. i waited an additional 30 minutes before calling the restaurant again to inform them that no one called me with an update. the staff inform me the grubhub driver has still not arrived to retrieve the food and don't know why he didn't call. at this point i inform the manager that i will be driving to the store (approximately 10 minutes away) in order to pick up my food. the manager apologized and claimed i would receive a 15% discount on my meal for the trouble. when i arrived at the restaurant there were a few customers ordering food to go, and the remaining staff did not greet me and i waited about 10 minutes before anyone came to see what i needed. once the staff brought my food out i mentioned the discount, i was then informed that because i ordered through grubhub there was nothing they could do at the restaurant for my trouble, and instead i would have to call grubhub directly to discuss the issues. i called grubhub and explained the situation and was informed they could reimburse the tip i had prepaid the delivery driver who never showed, and would give me a $5 credit for the trouble. a measly $5 for over two and a half hours of stress, frustration, and the gas to drive to and from the restaurant instead of their delivery driver not showing. and while root of the issue was caused by a grubhub driver that didn't show, the whole thing could have been avoided if buffalo wild wings had simply called me to inform me the driver didn't show and asked if i wouldn't mind picking up my order instead. never coming back to this restaurant."
"great wings. staff was exceptionally helpful and welcoming. assisted in explaining all flavors, as this was  my first time in any bww. clean venue. parking was very accessible. overall the environment is great, tons of people there on dates, groups of dudes and families. the only negative is i had gotten charged for tap water. $2.69 for a soda and the same price for tap water.. not cool.bww serves great food but isn't really a cheap option, so keep this in mind."
"i have friends who live nearby, and we've gotten takeout from here several times. i've never been disappointed with what we ordered, and the food ""held"" well in the drive back to their house. my first dinner here was, surprisingly, a little more ""meh."" it's got a lot of what i expect at a buffalo wild wings - an extensive array of burgers, sandwiches, wings, apps. then there's my favorite part, the craft beer list. i find their apps to be ridiculously salty, as in ""we want you to order more drinks"" salty. of course, with salt comes flavor, so it's a mixed bag.  i found the fries which accompanied my burger to be equally salty. you can add a salad or cole slaw to entrees for a modest fee, and this is not a bad idea if you want a healthier option.i tried the boston lager burger, one of their specials, which came with said salty fries. my waitress did not ask how i wanted it done - it came out medium well, but it was still very juicy and flavorful, as were the mushrooms and onions on it. i did not care for the ""cheesy stuff"" drizzled on the burger in a cute pattern. this did nothing to enhance the flavor of the burger and simply made it unnecessarily messy. i prefer things like lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles on my burger instead of sauces. if i have to go back to building my own burger (and unfortunately foregoing the steeped-in-beer option), so be it. service here is attentive and fun. they also offer outside dining, thankfully covered by an awning for those afternoons with thunderstorms."
