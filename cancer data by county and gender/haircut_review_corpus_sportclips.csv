"an absolutely great way to start the day. walked in and was greeted with a smile. her name is nena and she is highly recommended. i was invited into a chair, we talked about my mess of hair, decided what we were going to do and got right to it. she offered an upgrade but i didn't want it. but once we started talking and i was feeling good. i asked for the mvp.  best decision. warm towel, hair washed, product put in, massaged my neck and shoulders, and facial massage too!great way to start the day!as i was getting all bundled up ready to leave, she was going over the cost for everything, she mentioned i was in before 11... discount!  what an amazing stylist and i will enjoy the rest of my day immensely.thank you nena. such a great price for everything i received. when my wife goes to those other places they cost way more and they don't show sports!!  i'll be back!!"
"avoid this location!! the stylists are uninterested and absolutely not dedicated to their craft, let alone decent customer service. if you must go to a sports clips, the employees down the street at the lincoln park location are much more likely to make you feel welcome and comfortable."
"haircut was fine but the only reason i came was because a coupon i got in the mail for a $9 haircut a week ago. i thought, ""why not"". when i got done i presented the coupon and the stylist pointed out it expires in 2013... now why would i be receiving a coupon in 2018 that expires in 2013? must of been a typo by the marketing team but they refused to honor the coupon and made me full price. if i was going to pay full price, i definitely have much better options. i don't care about the money but it's just rude customer service in my opinion."
"i'm from austin/georgetown texas, so very familiar with sportclips.  while i am somewhat picky about how my hair is cut, i always manage to find someone at sportclips that can do a good job.  brenda at this location is no exception!  she is very nice, and has done an excellent job at making me look good, on multiple occasions.  i was having trouble finding a job, so not only did she hook me up with a great haircut, but comforted me and listened to me vent a little.  it made a huge impact!"
"excellent atmosphere, stylist didnt talk much till it came time to promote products.one of they only sportclips in country with massage chairs.  but one of the best mvp curs ive had in a long time.....excellent location by the friendly confines of wrigley..stop by before a cardinals...i mean cubs game"
"just got a pretty bad haircut here. very rushed, the sides of my hair are uneven, stylist did not seem to interested in giving me a nice haircut. no way will i pay 20 dollars again for a haircut like that, there are way better places in chicago. i should have listened to the other yelp reviews."
"got my haircut here today, and i was really pleased. my stylist, mary, was very friendly and did a great job. she listened to what i wanted and did just that. i got the treatment with the steamed towel, and the extra few dollars are definitely worth it. the place was clean, atmosphere was cool, staff was friendly, so i'll be back."
my boyfriend just waited 30 minutes to get his hair cut and the stylists let 2 people cut him. it was ridiculous. he was on his lunch break and did not have an hour to dedicate. do not go here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what terrible customer service.
"friendly staff, reasonable prices and i get to watch sports while i get my hair cut- what more can i ask for?  they do a reasonable and consistent job with the hair-cut.   i recommend that you upgrade to the mvp with the hot towel, scalp massage etc.oh, and the free trim between haircuts is a great feature too."
"i tried sportsclips a few times as they are just a short walk from my residence, but feel that they are overpriced for the quality of service you receive. it seems as though most of the people working there are novices. i received some decent haircuts, but also a couple of bad ones. they tend to use primarily clippers rather than scissors. basically sports clips is your typical $8 haircut place (i.e. greatclips, superclips etc.) that creates a ""manly"" environment through having a sports theme (i.e. stadium style seating in the waiting area, the staff wears referee shirts, they show sports games on tv and have memorabilia on the walls etc.) - and then they jack the price up to nearly  triple what a greatclips or superclips charges. to me the sports theme comes across as a bit cheesy and overdone and certainly does not justify charging $20 plus for an $8 quality haircut.there are some pluses to sportsclips; they do often have coupons out there that knock a few bucks off the cost, no appointment is needed and for a few bucks extra you can receive a mini spa package including a shampoo, steamed towel and mini massage (again none of this is fancy, but it adds a bit to the experience). if you are a male in your teens or early twenties you may find sportsclips entertaining and enjoy the experience, but i do not believe it is a good option for anybody outside of this demographic. you can pay about $10 to $15 more and have a much more professional haircut performed at a myriad of other nearby facilities or you can pay $12 less and have the same quality haircut without the sports theme."
"great atmosphere and they cut my hair the way i want it done...tough to ask for anything more.  during peak hours the wait can be a little long though, so i would recommend not going 5-7pm on a weekday."
i've been going to sportclips for haircuts for about 2 years now and i'm pleased with the service that i receive here.  the women cutting your hair all do a good job and are pretty consistent from one to the other.  it's nice to have a sports themed place to go where there are games on the tvs and the people cutting your hair can also talk sports.i've had each level of haircut here and the massage and hot towel are defintely nice touches when i do get them.  it's also worth noting that the hot towel and massage are more than just going through the motions - you actually have time to enjoy both.another nice service is that if you are a return customer they capture your information in the system so each time you return they know how you like your hair cut.
"i consistently get a good haircut here with little to no wait, and being able to watch espn makes the time pass quickly. i don't get the hooters comparison that some other yelper had alluded to...perhaps he was trying to be funny. anyway, i've been coming here for over a year now and am a satisfied customer. the stylists are personable, professional, and give good haircuts. the hot towel and scalp massage are nice if you opt for the mvp, though the neck&shoulder massage is nothing special.other yelpers have complained about ""upselling,"" but as a regular who knows what they want and/or don't want, the upselling can be handled with a polite ""no thanks"" or two.be sure to fill out the receipt survey (it takes about 2 minutes) for three bucks off your next haircut."
"nice haircut, but without the shave what good are the other services, like a hot towel? sure it feels nice, but it is only half the service.  i'd like the service better if they added a shave with or without a straight razor."
"i got a haircut here on 02/17. i'll get the easy part out of the way - the haircut was fine. she did a nice job. no big deal.the turnoff for me was the constant selling of their products/services. walking in, i gave my name, email and phone number. then i heard about the 3 different service levels they have. then i had to choose. then i had to hear about it again while i was in the chair.it goes a little like this:basic haircut = $17haircut with neck massage, shampoo, and hot towel on the face: $22i didn't mind being asked what i wanted. but i resented the constant ""up selling"" and explanation of service. i just wanted a haircut. and i felt like i had to keep justifying it. for instance, when she brushed the hair out of my face, she again told me that i could pay extra for the shampoo so i wouldn't have that problem later in the day.i typically get my haircut at gabbys (on clark, north of diversey). a haircut there is $15 and includes a neck shave with a straight razor! i've also had them shampoo me before and they didn't charge me anything extra. and don't get me started on the atmosphere at gabbys - tons of great magazines, laid-back attitude, great music, nice people, etc.i chose to go to sport clips on this particular day because i figured that gabby's would have been packed. i will not make that mistake again. gabbys is a far superior experience and (when necessary), worth the wait."
good haircuts with a relaxing scalp massage when you're getting your hair cleaned.  also the guy that owns this one gives a discount to first responders and military.
"super under-rated haircut place. it's good service, friendly staff, and pretty reasonable. i've gone to other locations, but it seems the staff here is generally the best. great for value guys like me."
"i was at marshall's this weekend and found a coupon. as i was in need of a trim i walked in on a saturday evening. the staff was fun and courteous. rachel my stylist was perky, attentive and made some great suggestions. i am busy so time is important to me but i will gladly  take the time for a 30 minute spa treatment with sports on the tube any day. the top of the line treatment including a cut, body massage chair during the shampoo with paul mitchell products, neck and scalp massage, and a hot face towel all for under $25.00! you've got to be kidding me. i went ahead and purchased the multi-cut deal to lock in the low intro price. i look forward to my next spa session in 2- 3 weeks cuz trims are free!"
"the staff are very professional and they take their jobs seriously. my hair dresser is amazing because she pays attention to little details that no one would. i have been going there for 4 months and she knows me so well, she knows what to do with my hair right away."
picture hooters opening a hair salon.i feel bad for the women working here.
"molly was very friendly and the complimentary mvp package as a first timer was luxurious.they don't do line ups which was disappointing but overall, i would come back."
"i gravitate towards sc locations no matter what city i'm in because i know what to expect.  when trying out a new barber, there's always the danger of the unexpected: they don't take walkins, they don't take credit cards, there's a long wait, etc.  but sc has standardized service (as much as they can standardize service across so many different barbers), so i know what i'm in for.  at this location, there's usually a wait, but there's enough stuff in the area that you can go get a sandwich or a coffee and come back in a few minutes.  they're pretty good at estimating the wait times.  plus, they do a good job, and the barbers are friendly."
"been here many times, showed up at 7:45pm and was told they are closed. guess i won't ever go back. i realize you want to go home, but at least lock the front door. also, why do you have hours in the door if you don't follow them?"
i had the greatest service for a decent price! i was very well taken care of and my hair looks awesome :) i'm totally coming here again
"high turnover, went here off and on for almost 4 years and never even saw the same person let alone had my hair cut by the same person. cuts were always mediocre. generally good if you need to get in and out quickly."
"sport clips is like the buffalo wild wings of barbershops. super chain-y from the décor to the ""welcome to sport clips, we'll be with you in a moment"" greeting, but i definitely dig it. although it's not an actual barbershop that does straight razor shaves, this salon totally appeals to the male demo. from the tv's touting sports games to the flirty stylists, it's just got an overall dude vibe...obviously. ultimately, they do a decent doo for a fair price, (about $18) and they'll line you up in the back for free anytime you need it so that's a big plus. if you want something super stylish it might not be your bag, but if your head is like mine and doesn't require much maintenance i'd definitely rec it."
"if you want a decent haircut, this is not the place. the cut was done very fast is not clean at all. i will not go there again."
"just horrible!!! if u r looking for a quick i-don't-care-how-it-turns out haircut then this is the place. very unprofessional and crude. the reason why i am giving them 1 star is because the ""stylist"" did not charge me for the haircut because she realized she completely screwed up mine. i guess they do that a lot. stay away if u are looking for a decent hair cut."
"if you are looking to be in and out on your lunch break this is the place to go. if you are looking for someone to spend the time to make sure every strand of hair on your head is perfect, this is not the place.you get what you pay for here,  medium price medium look. but the workers are friendly which is awesome. id go again if just looking for a quick cut."
"first time customers get a free upgrade to the ""full service cut"" that includes shampoo, hot towel, etc.mid-day during the week the place was empty and service fast. happy with the haircut."
"pretty good haircut for 18 bucks. nadia did a good job on my old-guy hair. the locker room theme is a little hokey, but give them credit for trying something different."
"don't know why yelp deleted my previous review. do not go to this place for a haircut.  and do not have ""nicole"", cut your hair.  i went in last night for a haircut after work.  i showed her a photo (front, side, and back views) of myself from a haircut i had few months ago.  i told her i wanted the same haircut (about 1.5"" on the top, with sides and back faded at very short 1 clippers).  she said okay, took off my glasses, and proceeded to buzz my sides and back (which was fine).  then without saying anything she started grabbing my hair (from the top of my head) and clipping it off....all the way to only 1/2"" left on the top.  when she was finally done, it looked completely horrible.  it looked nothing like the self photos i had shown her.  i had planned on leaving a $10 tip since i came in with a coupon.  when i saw how horrible my cut looked, i just walked out....since complaining wouldn't do anything since there was no hair left to fix.  :("
"woowhad an awesome girlfriend and everything was going fine until i got my haircut here at sports clips. one side of my hair wasn't even the same length. sure enough, she breaks up with me today. thanks a lot."
place was pretty empty when i went in. they have a bunch of tvs and it they tried to make the place into a man cave. the people working there are really nice. they do a good job cutting hair as well. they gave me a shampoo and a head massage at the end too!
had nadia and i must say that her customer service was excellent! i look forward to have her to do my haircut again.
the online system needs a lot of work.  i reserved an appointment with the same stylist that cuts my hair every time.  i arrived at the recommended time but when i got there i was told that the person had already left for the day.  i asked why the online system would allow you to reserve an appointment with someone who is leaving soon and was told that the system doesn't account for this.  so you have to call to verify that the stylist you want to go with is there because the online system can't be trusted.  totally defeats the purpose.  other than that i like the place so...3 stars.
"so when's the last time you got a haircut where you get in the car, check the rear view-mirror and think god-damn i look good. i had mine recently, compliments of monica. can't wait for it to grow out so i can see her again. it's a bittersweet, but more sweet than bitter. until we meet again, monica."
do not go here. i just took my eight year old son for the first time and the hair dresser cut his ear and then blamed him. which is impossible because his hands were under the cape. thank goodness i was standing right next to him and could argue with her. she also gave him the worst fade he has ever received. she barley brushed his hair before she started and so it is all uneven. and at the very end she had the nerve to try to charge us $17 for the haircut even though he was still bleeding; i refused. she also claimed she had no way of helping me clean his wound but that she sterilized her equipment each morning so he should be fine. this was the worst experience i have ever seen.
"the only way to check in is on-line, and no way to select a time.   just before i left my office at 4:40, 0 min wait.  no way to reserve 5:30 spot.  when i called to ask, no help.  got to store at 5:30, now there is a 30 min wait.  goofy system.  waste of time."
"sportclips: now offering everything except haircuts!after what was easily one of the worst days in recent memory, i came here looking forward to a decent haircut experience.  that, i did not receive.maybe the sign that i was the only customer at 6pm on a weeknight should've tipped me off, but i wasn't phased.  as is the sport clips way, a stylist will greet you with a handshake and their name.  my stylist offered perhaps the weakest handshake in the history of the world, another bad indicator. she was a lousy conversationalist; the small talk was strained and not at all natural.  it actually felt like a bad first date, when you run out of things to discuss.  ""soo.....you lived here long?""  i can only carry the conversation so far, you've gotta at least meet me halfway.the haircut quality was acceptable but nothing groundbreaking.  what bothered me was her method: she used zero talcum powder and neglected to brush away loose hair, of which there was plenty.  several times i had to reach up and swat away big clumps of my own hair from my face, which i'm fairly certain is her responsibility, not the customer's.i never went to beauty school, but i'm also pretty sure you're supposed to adequately wet your customer's hair before cutting it.  since she didn't, those scary ass garden shears pulled my delicate hair out by the roots instead of neatly trimming it.  so that felt good.....not.whatever, i was glad to be done with that hair-filled torture chamber, and i made my way to the front to pay.  apparently they've added a new, exceedingly dumb option to their lineup: something called 'the stanley cup', which from what i can gather is a day-long process where you get a quadruple head shampoo, an hour's worth of massager, and 6x hot towel treatment.  pretty much everything except an under-the-table handy (or maybe that's included?)i'm reminded of the movie idiocracy where notsure walks past a starbucks and sees choices for a $2 latte, $200 'hot' latte, $2000 'full body' latte.  or the pollo borracho offering a bucket of wings with 'full release'.  like what sort of bogus freaking ponzi scheme nonsense is this oak park sport clips trying to get away with???what's even more peculiar is that this so-called ""stanley cup"" deluxe treatment is strangely absent on sport clips' website.  no mention whatsoever.  this goofy service can't be found at elmhurst.  or at darien.  or willowbrook.  or lombard.  only here, for some strange reason......hmmm.......the final blow came when i got rung up for $21.  a 'precision haircut' is only $17, always has been.  i briefly protested and she said ""we only offer the triple play, mvp, and stanley cup.""  that's right, you can't even get a simple haircut anymore.  only deluxe treatment for an insane upcharge.if you're in a rush and don't have time to screw around with a scalp massage or back vibrator and want just the basic haircut, you're forced to pay the same price as those who get massaged & vibrated.  ridiculous.when i pressed the matter, the only response i got was: ""oh, this one is different.""  yeah, no sh*t.  the other locations might not be great, but this one downright sucks.  truth be told, i was looking for a reason to find another haircuttery place (like haircuttery?) and this sport clips experience -- my last -- was the straw that broke the camel's back.with only one other review for this relatively new location, my 1* is going to hurt them more than it normally would, but i have little remorse.  their greed has lost them consistent business.say sayonara to a lifelong customer, you shady bastards!"
"today i went to this location before work.  i was there promptly at 10am, but the door was locked until about 5 after.  no big deal.i asked the stylist if she would accept the coupon off my phone.  she said that she must staple the paper coupon to the receipt.  i was obviously frustrated, but agreed and got a haircut.  the actual haircut is passable.  however, i agree with other posts that the upcharge for extra services is not reasonable.at the end of the haircut, when prompted to leave a tip and a donation, i declined.  the stylist asked if i was having a bad day.  well, yes, i said.  and reminded her that she declined to take my coupon.  she retorted that she gave me a good haircut and that is no reason not to leave a tip.excuse me!?!  did a sportclips employee just ask me for a tip?  while my credit card was in the machine processing, i asked to speak to a manger.""we don't have managers here,"" she told me.  i insisted on a number to call.  she told me that if i did not complete the transaction, she would call the police!never have i spent money in an establishment and been threatened with arrest.  she explained that if i was not happy with the service, ""you don't have to come back.""i never raised my voice, used profanity, or otherwise showed any disrespect to this employee, her colleague or other customers.  following payment, i again insisted on speaking with a manager.  this time, she gave me a business card for an ""area manager.""so to summarize:store opened latedeclined my couponexpected a tip and a donation on top of high priceemployee lied about having a manageremployee threatened to call the cops on a paying customeremployee reminded me that if i am not satisfied, i can take my business elsewhere.got it.  next time i will."
"i would never recommend this sport clips to anybody. i have come here a few times now and every time i leave i am disappointed. when i sit down in their chair i feel like another commission as they don't care about precision or quality. they only want to get you in and out. one time an employee was so rushed and sloppy. i later found out she was leaving in 10 minutes and wanted to make another sale. overall, i never recommend this location to anybody looking for a quality haircut. i am truly disgusted with this place."
"grand opening june 24-26. free 1&1/2 hour parking in neighboring holley court garage. located next to trader joes. revised hours 9am-8pm m-f, 8am-6pm sat, 10am-5pm sunday. try the mvp haircut for free with a coupon from the valpak mailers."
"this place gave me the worst haircut i've ever had, and then broke its own record the next time i went. the employees couldn't cut a lime if needed. on top of that, the ""sports atmosphere"" reminds me of my nephew's baseball bedroom decor.i have been going to different cheap franchise hair salons for the past 8 years, and this company and specific location has been the worst by far. the only reason i went twice was because they gave me a ""free haircut"" coupon. i was wrong when i thought i'd get a better cut the second time.the employees had no idea how to listen to what i'd like, specifically jennifer. my hair was cut the only way she knew how to cut hair, so tough luck for me. every time i asked for a minor adjustment, she would cut all my hair shorter as well, while chatting with other employees. she also wet my hair and combed it over in a way i never have before, and when i told her i don't want it cut to that style, she made up an excuse to keep it combed that way so she can cut it how i like. i came out with a buzz cut, while jennifer complimented her own work to make me feel more comfortable with what i paid for. and if you don't style your hair, it doesn't matter. after telling her twice i didn't want any styling cream, she put a lot on anyway. very very rude.i don't see this place lasting much longer. it's a styling cream store disguised as a hair salon. poor cuts=more styling cream sales. if you have hair longer than an inch, i recommend going somewhere, anywhere else. if you don't like others telling you how to wear your own hair, i don't recommend this place."
"found a free mvp haircut ($23 value!) in the money mailer for the location in my neighborhood - oak park, il. despite the negative reviews i wanted to see for myself - hey free $23 haircut is a good deal! i printed out a coupon for myself and son. i came in on a lazy sunday afternoon. no real wait - 3 of the 4 chairs were occupied. i was greeted promptly and the lady's were nice and attentive. the place is clean and in a nice area! huge 70"" flatscreen lcd in waiting room playing football. my son got his hair cut 1st. i explained the cut to our stylist, januari: 1-2 fade on the sides, short up top, combed forward, spiked up front. she cut exactly as explained. clean, tight fade. the mvp includes shampoo and conditioner, hot towel and massage...really? wow, ok... my son gets the whole treatment and i'm envious. i don't recall getting this treatment myself, ever. i confirmed with januari, that this was free with the coupon - it was. so my son get's the cut, massage chair, hot shampoo and hot towel. all done, he looked refreshed, nice tight hair cut. job well done januari! thanks! i tipped her well. my son looks great. it was 5pm and closing time so i didn't get my cut. i'll be coming back this week though.  i kinda interviewed the beauticians there to see how long they've been cutting hair. januari about 10 years, jennifer, over 10. that's good enough experience for me. also... they guarantee their haircuts, if you don't like the cut you don't pay. i'll be back this week to get my mvp treatment. again... free with the coupon. i love that business model! forego the expensive tv commercial, pass the savings to the client... invokes the law of reciprocity. i feel appreciative for the free cut, now they've made a client. i'll be back regularly to patronize this business. i'll update the review once i get my haircut. in my experience great place!update 02-07-2017came back to get my haircut on a busy saturday. all 6 chairs had customers getting haircuts but wait area was open. clean as always. watched superbowl 51 previews on big screen. short wait, about 10 minutes, before i was called back. i was able to see the haircuts of the other patrons and have to say i was very impressed. these girls can cut hair! januari asked how i wanted it and explained to her. she cut it exactly how as explained. she checked with me during and after the cut to get my approval. a-ok. after the cut, i received rest of the mvp package: the hot towel, hair shampoo/conditioner treatment and massage. very nice job with everything. i'm very satisfied and happy with service and tipped her accordingly. i'll be coming back regularly."
service excellent.  hairstylists friendly and patient.  value is off the charts.  they have reinvented a style for me that has carried well over the past year.  i really appreciate their staff and especially their manager!    i would highly recommend this as your go to place as you will get great customer service from a staff that smiles and actually enjoys what they do.
got a great hair cut and unexpected scalp massage from kate. the experience was great. thanks kate. now i am rhyming and i didn't even mean it lol. ask for kate!
"i've been coming here for 2 and a half years and i think i'm finally at the point where i'm switching. my hair cut is easy, 3-5 on the sides and a trim on top. i say that every time and, yet, the employees here keep doing other things to my head. almost  every time i've gone, i've put up with the hard sell on paying to have my hair (re) washed (with excuses ranging from ""it makes it easier to cut"" to ""you have to"").lately it has gotten worse. more often, during the shampoo, i'm surprised with a hot towel and scalp massage (surprise! now you're paying for an mvp you didn't want, ask for, or ever discuss with your stylist).the last few times, they've shaved my neck without asking, raising my neckline at least an inch. i'm not sure how to protest this. they don't ask, we had only discussed a trim, and by the time i realize they're doing it, i need them to finish to make it even."
i been knowing diana for 5 years. i follow her everywhere she goes. she always cuts my hair perfectly. now that she's working here at sports clips i make my appointments from my phone.
"i have had several great experiences here, but that is largely due to diana perez, who has cut my hair for years.  i have followed her from another location to here because she is that good.  she takes her time to make sure you have exactly what you want.  she is not one to rush a haircut - you are her priority.  make sure you ask for diana when coming here!  you will end up going back time and time again."
"i had never been to a sport clips until diana,  my stylist, started working there this past fall.diana is the best!  always have an enjoyable visit.  she's a talented stylist,  a true professional and great person.  try the mvp service which includes a light massage, hair wash and a hot towel facial treatment, you won't be sorry...and ask for or schedule an appointment with diana.i've had my hair cut by 2 other stylists at this location and they both did a great job too but diana rocks it!"
"this sport clips is a gem because of 4 factors. first it's the location where you could get free adjacent parking at whole foods. second the shop is spacious and clean, with ample waiting room with big led screen. third, the staff are super friendly, jovial, and will always greet you with sweet smiles. my usual go-to is certainly diana, as she is meticulous, skillful, and handle your hairs with extra tlc! i recommend diana and this sport clip without  any reservation."
"i've been here a bunch of times, but the score is super low because my haircut was done by someone in store management.i showered an hour before and made sure my hair was dry before i rode my bike over.  i wear a helmet so there was a mark in the hair and i got a hard sell on a wash.  it combined/sprayed out easily though.  it doesn't explain how the fade in the back goes from a 1 or 2 buzzer to a scissor cut.  they haven't had a problem with this before.  i didn't realize how bad it was until i got home.  thy didn't ask about how i wanted my neckline, or give me a mirror to view the back.  i got interrogated about what hair gel i use, assuming for the sell.   all of this as shes throwing the tools back onto her work surface.never, ever going he again."
had a great haircut andconversation with the stylist . my favorite part aside from a nice haircut  is having a real scalp massage with the hair wash  and the  back massage machine they use.  i will be back
"must ask for diana for 5 star experience!! other than giving the best haircut and shampoo, she is an active listener and a very caring family oriented woman! i always tip her extra and feel very good about it! i followed her to many places and sportsclips is lucky to have her!! this facility is well taken care of and i recommend vip treatment!!"
always been satisfied with my haircut here. i've tried more expensive as well as cheaper options in the area but none seem to get it quite right. i love the haircut i just got from ashley gardner. one of the many great stylists at this location.
"my husband has been coming here since they've opened and loves it. he always gets a good cut and enjoys the warm towel treatment also. other side note: i think it's really great they give vets free hair cuts on veterans day. more companies should consider doing this, it's a nice thing to do and creates goodwill in the community."
"best hair cut i've ever had -- and my mom is a professional hair stylist.charli was great. talented, funny, and a baseball fan? i'll be back.ps - i hope my mom doesn't read this."
so glad i found this place. i received a free haircut in the mail for first time clients and decided to give this place a try. my stylists name was charli and she did an awesome job. she listened to exactly what i had asked for and paid close attention to detail. i am so happy there's a good haircut place close to my house. bonus- they play sports on tv and give a great shampoo massage!
"i have gotten my hair cut at high end salons all the way down to fantastic sam's. i keep coming back to this particular sport clips, not only because it is convenient to park for free and is close to home, but because of the staff. charli lyn has been cutting my hair the last few times i have been in. she is great.ni'm not sure how long she has been in the business but she goes above and beyond for a stylist at a national chain. she always makes me feel like a friend and keeps it professional. keep up the great cuts guys!"
great service and a friendly staff. charli is my go to girl and always provides stellar service .
"beware...it says free neck trim in the window,  but that's only for people in their system who have gotten a cut there before. the girls are nice though ...it's a corporate thing, not a problem with the nice ladies at this location"
this spot got new ownership from the river north location and they're really good. i usually go to the river north one but i moved to lakeview and i'm glad sports clips is just as good here. got the mvp as usual and the stylists knew exactly what i wanted still and gave me the same perfect cut.
owner reached out after a bad experience. solid guy. a bad experience or employee is sometimes unavoidable and it says a lot to take responsibility and try to make things right.
1.  stop trying to sell me stuff!!!  it's annoying!!2.  all your sports posters and trash cans remind me of a little kids bedroom.3.  your prices aren't good.  hair cuttery across the street is cheaper and simpler.three stars only because you have tv's to watch.
"this place was so bad that i politely asked the hairdresser to stop my haircut so i could go somewhere else to get it fixed.i ended up with this weird line on the side of my head. the hairline on the back of my head was completely lopsided. i'm not terribly picky when it comes to my hair, but i know i won't be back to this place."
great place to get a haircut! got my hair and beard cut by dana and love the outcome! would definitely recommend her for cutting your hair/beard!
"whatever happened to customer service? part 2so, i had gone to sports clips in west chicago (you can read that review) which led me here.  i walk up to the counter where two employees stood.  one asks me if i had been there before and i said i had not.  so, she flips around the pad that is screwed onto the counter and tells me to put in my information?  what?  isn't that something they do? isn't their system that they know how to navigate easier for them to fill out.  isn't ""connecting"" with a customer part of the corporate business plan for sports clip? because this whole ""do it yourself"" attitude seems to be at every shop. again, i ask, whatever happened to customer service?  a little interaction goes a long way.  they were standing right in front of me.  couldn't they spend a few minutes talking to a new client? i was actually a little bit taken aback by the whole thing to the point i stood there a few seconds thinking about whether i wanted to waste my time doing their job for them.  i decided i did not and i left. i ended up at supercuts down the road and, guess what, although both of the stylists were busy.  one took the time to greet me, ask if i could wait just a few minutes while she finished up her client, and offered me a water.  see, now, that wasn't that hard.  talk to the client.  acknowledge  he or she is the client.  be nice.  do your job.  that is customer service.  i am done with sports clips, though i had been a regular customer at other shops."
"i have not been here in a while. took a break to try other places. now that i have returned i am glad that i have. i received fast, friendly service and a good haircut as well. i was taken care of by perry and she did a great job."
been here three times for a shape up - they never seem to understand the phrase 'keep my natural line.' lesson learned. if you don't really care about your cut - sure come here. otherwise i'd stay away.
ask for ashly or  perry. they are cool and have good  barber fading and  stylist skills. went to get s cut right before the game and got to watch the start while in the chair. changes the whole sunday routine now that i can get a cut during the game and not miss any of it.  friendly and clean service. they do a very good job here.
"first time  there, had a great experience, alise cut my hair and she did it exactly how i wanted it. definitely go back and have her cut it again!"
"the girl who cut my hair (forgot her name?!) did a great job. she was friendly, smart and gave me a sharp, clean cut. the hot towel treatment is very relaxing if you don't mind spending a bit more. recommended!"
got here for the first time and got greeted right away. i was told to log in and put my information on their tablet so i did. it didn't take long for me to get my hair cut. i got a massage hair washed dried and as well as hot towel. overall it was a good experience.
"my boyfriend and i decided to stop on in to get him a haircut since it was right near costco. he told the girl exactly what he wanted and how he wanted it done. being an all male barbershop, you would expect these females to know how to cut and trim hair, right ? wrong . first of all the woman couldn't even do a simple lining, talking about how she doesn't have the proper tools to do so. how does a male salon not have the tools to do so?  it seemed as if she didn't even know how to properly ""clean"" up a guys hair. when my boyfriend called me over for my opinion, the lining wasn't straight and she looked as if she was nervous the whole entire time. his hair grows back fast so we definitely won't  be stopping here again."
"we normally have no issues with sports clip chain. but i brought my son to this sports clip, closer to my house, being his first time there, he should have triple play new customer price. that didn't happen. also, i had to ask her to wash his hair after the cut. no hot towel, or massage. but was charge that. not only that, next morning. my son woke up with his hair sticking up! if the cut was done properly, it would not have happened. been to other sports clip and did not have any issue with the cut. will not be coming back to this sports clip. no matter how close they r."
"the service is friendly, the quality of cut is good for cleanups and quick drop ins...and the price is right."
awesome service girls my boyfriend loves his cut and loved the real barbershop atmosphere see you guys in 6 weeks
"my hair was several inches long.  i asked kate for a straight side, flat top crew cut.  i got a sourball.  thanks a lot.  now i look like a kid.  good thing it grows back so i can go somewhere else to fix this."
got here on a saturday afternoon with no appointment and got right in the chair. jessica was super helpful and knowledgeable about the various products that they had to offer and their benefits. haircut went great! the head massage was great too!
"great location with friendly and cheerful staff!vanessa is my go-to stylist.  very informative, remembers your style, and provides valuable input!"
jessica is a very experienced stylist. my son is always satisfied with his haircut ! jen s.
"a great location to get a haircut i was drinking a beer minutes after i walked out of the store. really liked my cut and the stylist made suggestions for my cut which i much prefer over ""how would you like your hair cut. ""my usual reply is ( with scissors!) recommend this location especially good value compared to other options in the area. updating this as jessica was awesome great beard trim as well .6-7 stylists in the storeso didn't wait at all"
"i usually cut my sons hair every month or every other month just because he hates haircuts so i was in the area and decided to give it a shot at attempting to get a haircut! we walked in and walked over a friendly face girl which i clearly remember her name is wendy because my sons favorite place is wendys! :) so right off the bat i knew it would run smooth because my son smiled at her. she listened to my instructions and was super patient, and to my surprise my son stood still the whole time!! i absolutely loved the haircut, the ambience, the price, and of course wendy!"
"i would give this store a 5 rating if i was only rating jessica. she is an excellent stylist with an engaging personality. but i went to the store needing a hair cut before a business meeting, and it was jessica's day off. i got a cut from vanessa. after she finished i kept wondering why she was combing my hair in a completely different way from the way i told her. when i got home i found out why. when i comb my hair the way i normally do, it looks like i have a bald spot around the area of the part. i really should give the store a lower rating, but i've had too many good hair cuts from jessica. she is great and if she is not in, then you might want to wait."
"horrible experience, manager tried selling me a bunch of unnecessary garbage. if you cater to men, you should understand men. not every guy is a metro hipster. $50 on hair product is beyond silly."
erica knows what she's doing. will definitely come back for another cut next time!
"i came here 3 months ago and found jessica and mimi, both wonderful and professional."
"for a guy like me who's been obsessed my entire life with my hair, how to style it, and what product to use, ruth montero is a dream come true. her expertise at knowing how to tame my cowlick and other challenges is even more remarkable when you consider how quickly she works. a combination of professional and perky, ruth sends me out looking better and feeling terrific."
"i have been a loyal customer of this sport clips location for the past two years.  jessica is a great stylist and the new check-in feature is awesome.  i would highly recommend jessica, and many of the other stylists are excellent as well."
"no appointment but was taken right away.  had a free upgrade to the mvp package which is the haircut, shampoo (in a chair which gives you a short massage) warm towel on face for a couple minutes, and a shoulder massage. it was nice, but i wouldn't do it on a regular basis.  too expensive, even with free upgrade.stylist jay was nice and had interesting stories."
wow!!  what a great hair cut.   professional service.   i love going there.   always a professional and never been unhappy with the cut.   i have been coming here for over 3 years and still am very happy.
great people!! fast service!!! very happy!!definetly bringing my kids back.did not have to wait at all because they accept walk ins.. so happy.
"i met jessica 3 yrs ago & ever since, i have been one of her most loyal customers!! i have been following her ever since!! jessica is not only the most welcoming stylist, but one of the best!!she's always very friendly & professional!!! she always does a great job!!"
amazing service! the place is well managed & designers are top notch. it's hard to find great barber but this place epitomizes top notch service & great hair cut.
"i got a hair cut here tonight and the back is completely uneven. it's borderline absurd. the stylist clearly wasn't paying attention. also, i can actually see many hairs on the sides and top that she missed. i won't be coming back unless it's at a discounted price with a different stylist. the lesson here is to never leave supercuts."
consistently great cuts no matter which stylist i have used. friendly and professional service. with on-line check in it has become even more convenient. i have recommended sportclips to others and they have not been disappointed.
first review on yelp. worst haircut i've ever gotten. butchered the sides like i didn't think was even possible. will never go here again or recommend to anybody.
jessica does an awesome job. great deal for the money! they even throw in a free trim if you come back within 30 days!
"i moved a block away from this sports clips location a year ago, and have had nothing but great experiences here. today i had mimi as a stylist and she absolutely crushed it. i have a scar on my head and don't usually cut lower than a 6 on the sides. i told mimi i wanted to switch it up and go as short as possible on the sides without my scar showing too much. the haircut turned out awesome, with a short fade (0-4) in the back which is a new style for me. she definitely took her time to make sure the cut turned out just right, and i appreciate her not rushing through to get to the next client. all of the other stylists i've had here have been great too! selene did great last month. definitely recommend"
"if you're looking for an excellent haircut suited for your style, go see ashley. i continually travel out of my way just to get my perfect haircut from her. you should too."
"i have been coming to this salon from past 2 years. my hairdresser mimi, she's awesome. i have been her client since 2 years and i have never got disappointed by the service and my haircut.whenever she do my haircut, i don't know what magic she do? she give my hair a professional look all the time just like hairstyle we see of movie actors!"
"so i came to this store because it was closest in distance. all i can say is i'm glad i didn't go anywhere else. mimi the assistant manager has cut my hair several times and i always leave 1000% assured that i'm gonna leave the store looking good. she's an awesome person with a charismatic personality, i wouldn't go anywhere else now. today, shelby cut my hair and i have to say this location has the best stylists. they're awesome people and i can't wait to come back. thank you guys again, it's a pleasure, like always."
"i spent a lot of time looking for a good haircut in this neighborhood until i found mimi! she is really professional and have many years of experience, she is more a image consultant since she knows what type of hair style fits you better. on the other hand you'll have a good time to relax and have a nice conversation with her! the barbershop has a nice and clean facility perfect for enjoy a barber time!"
if you're looking for a barber that will make your dreams come true you have to go see mimi. mimi has been cutting my hair for the past 3 years. ive followed her to 3 different sport clips location as she is the only person allowed to touch my hair. i love mimi because she actually listens to you and will cut your hair the way you want it. unlike other barbers who say that they understand what you want and do the complete opposite. the staff that works with mimi are all so nice and friendly. a must go to get the right cut.
"ashley j was amazing. i had been getting my haircut at the same place for 15 years and needed a last minute haircut. that's how i found ashley. she was very professional, had great conversation and loved my haircut! i would recommend her to all my friends and family."
ever since i moved away from my hometown i've been struggling to find a good barber.. i've had some bad cuts from listening to peoples recommendations. it wasn't until i moved a few miles from this location that i finally came across mimi! you will not find anyone more friendly or skilled than her. i've seen her turnout some astounding transformations from her chair while waiting. to find anyone with this kind of talent is a life changing blessing!
i live about a block from here and usually go in to get a beard trim. they are fantastic at this location! i usually get a trim from mimi or karina. they are excellent! i could not be happier with the results!
"mimi was great! very skilled and kind! i will certainly return and recommend her to my friends. also, the online booking and queuing system is easy and convenient."
went there for the first time because i have gone to a sportsclips for years. love the steam towel and especially when they have the double steam towel/double shampoo is awesome. but my first experience with this one was terrible. i told her what to do with my hair and totally botched my haircut.... won't ever go back to this location but will go back to another and put a better review.
"i have been getting my hair cut by mimi for the past year or so at sport clips and i couldn't be happier. she does a fantastic job every time i go and it is obvious that she has many years of experience. i often get compliments from family, friends and colleagues, and to be honest that didn't happen until i started going to her. it has taken me a long time to find a good stylist so i hope she stays at this location!"
"new to the chicago/lincoln park area, and this was my first haircut with sports clips.  karina was absolutely amazing!  i showed her a picture of how i normally had my hair cut back in houston, and she exceeded my expectations!  she made me feel right at home and i cannot thank her enough.  her and her staff were very friendly and i will definitely be back to see karina and the rest of the staff soon!"
"i have been going to sport clips for a few years and i can't say enough great things.  i get a great haircut at a great price.  my stylist ashley is #1, she has a great personality, fun to chat with, and of course gives me a great style every time i come in.  the diversey location is very clean and professional looking.  i would highly recommend sport clips and ashley."
"karina (who was just promoted to manager) is amazing. i purposely come out of my way to get my haircut from her, along with my partner. i highly recommend her and staff, very professional, cut your hair exactly as you ask and extremely inviting! i will be back!"
"carina took care of my hair, was very professional and super nice! the facility was clean and staff was very helpful:)"
i used to live right around the corner and moved further away but i still make my way there to see karina! she's great and i highly recommend! i am always extremely happy with my cut!
"this place is great, everyone is so nice and friendly. i come here to get my hair and beard done and my wife loves it, she says i look like a real latin lover when i leave this place. karina really makes it easy for me, she always remembers my style and she nails it every time, she's the best."
mimi is the best. she knows how to give stylish cuts and maintain the health of the scalp. i recommend her at 5 stars!!!
"my best friend manages a salon in wicker park that i used to go to all the time, but living in lakeview, it's hard to get out there. i've tried many salons in the lakeview area and have left feeling not as confident, disappointed, fixing my hair once i get home, and even like i could have done a better job myself. i finally decided to give this sports clips location a try. why not? they were giving away a free cut for first time visitors when i went. ever since then, i haven't stopped going. it's been over a year now. this place is packed with talent!!! the staff is so kind, they listen, and they want you leaving happy. my favorite is karina. she really remembers you, what you like, what you talked about the last time you were there, and you can tell that she really enjoys what she does and will do anything to make her clients happy. you are the best, karina! but like i said, this place is full of talent from mimi to scarlet, and even when i leave the salon, i see great haircuts all around. use the online check-in so you don't have to wait so long!! just go online and do it that way. you won't regret it, especially since these talented stylists get busy! you could also put your name in and stop by a few other stores in the area. great location. hope you enjoy!!"
"nice spot for a haircut.  i was worried about going to a chain barber, but i was very pleased with the cut, the service and the facilities. i was happy with the attention and cut by drea. you cannot make an appointment, but you can check-in online. the website allows you to see the wait times, and you can check in for a particular stylist or for first available. then, when you arrive, you enter your phone number to check-in. the place has a sports theme. the seating area contains stadium seats; the tvs are showing sports channels; and the overall design of the place is closer to a sports bar than an old-time barber shop. (frankly, i'd prefer a little music to the tv audio, but most men would feel otherwise.) the first step is to go back to a darker room, sit in a massage chair, and get your hair washed while enjoying a hot towel treatment.  nice start! then it's back to the front for the cut. fine place for a good cut!"
"i recently moved to the city of chicago and had previously went to my same barber for the last 3 years... so choosing my next regular place to go was very important. i tried out a few of the downtown ""fancy"" salons and just couldn't find what i was looking for and someone skilled and genuine that i'd like to have style my hair weekly. i was lucky enough to be referred by a friend to ms drea here at sports clips river north! she is such a joy to see every week, always has a great upbeat energy, always engages in conversation, and puts the utmost detail and effort into my very specific cut i get. i suggest building the online profile and checking in online prior to heading over, they do get busy and it really helps to have your name on the list. sports slips offers a couple of service options from your basic men's cut ($20), the triple play ($25) get you the cut, massaging shampoo, and a steamed towel, then finally the mvp ($27) that gives you all of the above plus a head and shoulder massage. i personally do the basic cut every week to keep clean and then do the mvp once a month to ""treat myself"". drea is truly a skilled stylist, a genuine person, and has a great schedule that with week day availability! i would recommend her to anyone looking for that special treatment."
"need to get my hair cut for lollapalooza weekend. wasn't exactly sure what do i want. but, katie b. helped with my style exactly what i needed.  she was very patient and took her time to make sure it exceeded my expectations."
"holly was great! good cut, friendly staff, clean salon! short wait time, even on a friday afternoon! online check in is easy and nice. good price for the area. hot towel is a nice touch"
"6 people have cut my hair in the last 14 years and 2 of them only did it once. so i'm kinda picky. erin took great care of me, she's very consultative and professional. i appreciate that even when this place is super busy, everyone takes the time to greet customers and you don't feel like your stylist is trying to rush you to get to the next person. very well run and efficient and i've been very happy with my cuts since i started coming here."
"typical chain. when there was a specific manager there, she cared about the locals and regulars. the new staff does not care. long delays now and horrible customer service."
"blink and you will miss this location; it's tucked away at the top of some stairs on superior st downtown. i was travelling and in need of a haircut and i frequent a sports clips in s california. concept is the same and the staff can make or break it. got a great haircut by  emily,she was nice and chatty, all the staff seemed friendly  of what i could see- could go in the other direction if your an 'out of towner' though, didn't in my case. no frills, got what i needed in a small amount  of time."
drea was amazing. she takes her time and takes pride in her work. i highly recommend her!
"every new place i've gone to get my haircut, i've had anxiety from how difficult it is to explain my weird head shape (ridges on each side of my head that stick out) and how i'd like my hair cut and faded on the sides to mask these ridges. i scheduled an appointment with drea after reading many positive reviews on here, and before the hair cut i explained to her how particular i was about getting my hair cut to accommodate my head shape. she was great about listening to my concerns, offering her insight, and giving me a great haircut on my very first appointment! she is very sincere about wanting to give you the best cut possible, and she was especially patient with me during the first haircut, and spent a lot of time with me. and because she listened so carefully and took specific notes , the next haircuts i barely had to chime in at all, and she knew exactly how to give me the specific haircut i wanted!i have gone to other much more expensive salons since moving to chicago, and have had stylists literally tell me they couldn't cut my hair the way i wanted or that what i was asking was ""not possible"" with my head shape. these other stylists didn't seem to have any genuine care  and just wanted to get me in and out of the barber chair. with drea however, she listened, was very detailed, and gave me a great cut. i will be a repeat customer, and it's a relief to finally have found a stylist that can cut my hair the way i want!"
"2.5 stars would be the most accurate review of my experience. it wasn't all bad, more like slightly below average. i know you sometimes get what you pay for, but having been to several sports clips around the country, i knew what to expect. overall, my expectations of an average everyday haircut were not met. first, i was made to wait when i was the only patron and there were two barbers working. then, the notes that they had from a previous trip accurately described the haircut i wanted, but it was definitely not what i received. rather than blending the sides into the top, i now have a pseudo-mohawk. my neck wasn't touched leaving me work to do at home. and even though the notes stated that i usually get the mvp and the barber and i confirmed this, she told me i was done without the shampoo and massage. i know mistakes happen, but the packages are part of what sports clips markets themselves on.new to the area, i will be looking again for a new barber."
it's been a while since i've had such a great haircut and some really good customer service with a hairstylist that cares about your satisfaction. shoutout to drea for making this a great experience!
"i've been coming here for about a year and a half now. they always do a great job. special shout out to saundrea who has handled my hair cuts the last few times, and she knocks it out of the park. she pays attention to the little details and makes sure you're gonna look great! give her extra tips, and a raise!"
emily gave me a great haircut and shampoo today- looking forward to coming back soon!
"i have curly hair, and it's tough to find a barber that does a great job for me. i've been going to drea at sportclips for the past 2.5 years and am very happy with her haircuts!also, a great perk at sportclips, among others, is that they do free neck trims if you go back within 30 days of a haircut."
saunders is the bomb!! so much attention to detail and talent! i have never before received a cut where someone spent as much time as they did here.
wow wow wow i think i finally find my favorites haircut place ever!!!! use to go to sports clips in mt prospect illinois and it was above average however sandrea aka drea at the superior st location downtown is beyond relent at her profesion. she's amazing i take that back she's way beyond amazing i honestly have to admit this is my best haircut ever and after reading the other recommendations well worth it especially so convenient to where i live literally walking distance.sports clips definitely have earned a customer for life as long as drea is there .  thank you again and see you in about 10 days for hopefully another amazing haircut!!!  ps ask for drea and trust me you'll be amazed as well!!!
"i was surprised to see all of the rave reviews on here. yes, they do an alright job but my experience has been very variable. pros: martina, tina, and a few of the other girls do a good job, keep you looking fresh, can offer product suggestions without being pushy, and won't try to up sell you if just want a cut without the vip treatment.cons: i keep going mid afternoon during the week and having to wait for over an hour, they have three stylists working but the wait has been crazy lately. also, i did have a bad hair cut from one of the stylists- she was a smoker and smelled strongly of it plus left me with a dumb and dumber look that i was not a fan of. during my last trip the stylist also accidentally cut my neck- she apologized profusely and gave me a discount though so it wasn't the end of the world. the key with this place: get all of their discounts- they send out a lot and pick a good stylist like martina."
"i've been to this location a few times but more or less went there when i couldn't schedule a more ""high end"" stylist. my most recent visit i decided to schedule with the drea/sandrea considering all of her positive reviews on here. never have i ever had any hairstylist do so well particularly on the back. at first i was nervous with feeling how high she was taking the buzzer on my neck line.. when she showed me what it looked like i was kind of stunned. she fixed a bad situation i never really noticed before. i've paid ridiculous amounts for a so called ""high end"" haircut at pricy salons and at a mere $30 it was far and away the best cut i've ever had. i'll definitely be a regular for drea. she is a great stylist!"
"""appointment"" system is a nightmare. i work at an office about two blocks away. from the time it took to place and walk to the ""appointment"" my slot was already gone. i was told a barber was just finishing up and that i would be next, however, between the time that lie was given and her ringing up the client she was finished up with another person walked in and i was once again bumped. if you have time to kill in half-hour increments then i highly recommend this establishment. i won't pretend to know what rules they have to follow on their queueing system, it doesn't excuse telling someone that you're about to cut their hair and in the next breath say that it'll be another half hour."
"great sport clips, convenient location with great stylists. saundrea is the most talented stylist i've ever been to."
courtney is great! always get my haircut from her. $20 haircuts. depaul students also get free upgrade to mvp which includes free hair wash and hot towels
"i've been to this location on and off for about 4 years and my experience hit rock bottom at my last visit.  i can only trust one stylist at this establishment, but since it's just first come first serve, they will not allow you to request someone.  the most recent stylist i had ran clippers through my hair before asking me how i wanted it cut.  she made zero effort to provide any decent customer service and continued to talk to her coworker about how her ""brother didn't pick her to be his child's god-mother"" or how her ""friend didn't invite her to go on vacation.""  seriously?i will not be going here ever again."
"i received a haircut,back masssge, hot towel, and tea tree wash (v.i.p treatment)! jamea was very attentive to my needs and recommended products that would be best suitable for my hair. the atmosphere was very professional and my hair cut was perfect! price was also affordable. street parking is $2 for an hour."
"courtney was super quick to inform on the phone. she is really quiet and highly professional ..talks to the point on the phone.she was able to find a new product called ""shaver sahaperby wahl super close"" this takes off and you do not have to come home and shave again - this is amazing.she said this is a new product and i do have the picture of it...i believe this is sold through sallys beauty care or so.anyhow for the first time, she did an excellent job. i am totally new to this place in chicago, il.. normally i go to altamonte springs florida sport clips only:)she was kind enough to give some coupon on return visit and if i refer alsoher name was courtney in lincoln park, chicago , il 60614"
"i received the worst haircut of my life at sport clips recently. my barber was unavailable and i took the risk of going to the first available place, which turned out to be a horrible experience.i can compare it to being on a rollercoaster and wanting to get off near the top, but not being able to because you are already locked in your seat.the girl cutting my hair was worse than a used car salesman, attempting to up sell me on the ""tea tree lotion"", "" the mvp upgrade"", ""the hair products"". i just wanted a haircut, not to be badgered into buying stuff i didn't need or want.she shaved the hairline up so far on my neck that i sat there in awe when she showed me in the mirror. i was contemplating shaving my whole head since the haircut passed the point of no return. the simple instructions i provided turned into the most misinterpreted hair cut i ever had.getting a bad haircut is one of the worst fears i have and it was like nightmare on elm street in sports clips."
"first time to this location so courtney upgraded to the mvp i believe for free. very satisfied with my cut, very professional and she was pretty fun to talk to. if i'm ever in chicago i'll definitely be back hopefully she will still be there. she sis a great job. thanks."
"thought it was great.  went in on a coupon and decided to get the mvp.  hannah i think was my stylist and she couldn't have been nicer.  gave me the dog and pony show just like everywhere else and wasn't pushy.  dug the whole thing and don't know why i need to spend $60 for someone else.  actually bought the whatever pack for 6 haircuts.  its easy, close an they have on espn the whole time."
worst place. i never review. but i just don't understand the mentality here. there was 3 customers waiting and 3 stylist. i understand they have to clean their stations but they were no where in sight. they were fooling around outside probably smoking while we wait. that's bullshit.  you take care of the customers then dick around if you want. i arrived there at about 530 and didn't leave until around 645 with 3 people ahead of me and 3 stylist. you do the math. one of girls didn't even come back in until i was finished. i had to get up and say something to one of the stylist if they can cut my hair now. she knows it was wrong cause she didn't argue w me  all around bullshit service never go back
"the girls here always do a nice job and i really enjoy the mvp service. my main gripe about this place is that they really need to have a full time person at the front desk. any time people walk in or the phone rings, the stylists have to leave their clients in the chair to attend to it. this really seems disrespectful to the person getting their hair cut and i'm sure it keeps the stylists from doing their best as well.i'm a very patient person so i have always just dealt with it. however if they don't change that soon i might go elsewhere to get my hair cut."
"echoing the review below about this being the worst hair cut experience i've ever had. maybe this is what i get for going to a place with a tacky sports theme. as a first time (oh, and last time) customer i was given a complimentary upgrade to the ""mvp,"" which by my description below should really worry you if you just go with the basic option.first of all, i had simple needs. #2 buzz cut, maybe a brief shampoo scalp massage kind of thing, but generally i'm not picky. this girl was running the clippers like she was trying to scalp me. i actually winced from that a couple times. i think i had the same stylist as matt m. who describes her grinding the clippers into his scalp. she was going so fast i would have thought there was a huge line out front - except i was the only person there. 10 seconds of shampooing and her elbowing a warm towel into my face and she was done. so that's the mvp. nevermind the sign that references about 3 other steps and emphasizes how relaxing it is. not here."
"to put it simply, this is a great place to get a very inexpensive, solid haircut in chicago. if you go with the season pass, you basically get 6 haircut/shampoo/hot towel/massage for $17 a piece. i'll admit that the massage is pretty worthless. they use one of those hand-massage/vibrator things that you can get from sharper image for $10...maybe even get one on sale from skymall.i used to go to swerve in old town, received the same haircut, no hot towel or ""meh"" massage and i paid $70. sure, i was offered coffee/tea/beer/wine before my haircut...but i can also pound a pbr before heading to sportclips and get the same experience. i don't need to spend an extra $50.i've had a number of different stylists over the past 2-3 years and i've not once had a bad haircut. i'm not very picky myself, nor am i naive, so i am sure other people have had a particular experience in which a stylist did not adhere to their particular tastes...but i have no complaints here.if you're a regular dude in chicago looking for a solid, well-priced haircut, you can't go wrong here."
"i'm in the military and have a string of different regulations that my hair must conform to.  if not, i have eight different bosses who go out of their way to yell at me as to why it isn't.  this is why you see so many people with a buzz cut in the service...it is sooo much easier to get it right by cutting it all off than trying.   i drive an hour each way to get my hair cut because these girls get it right every time.  of course i have my favorite stylist, but when she isn't there i don't have to worry.   every single one of them has, and will, cut my hair exactly how i want it.   they're also a team of perfectionists, and won't let me walk out the door without it being exactly right.  i don't think you'd find a team of equally talented ladies anywhere else in the city.  they're all funny, welcoming and personable, and the best at what they do!"
"formerly down the street from where i lived, sportclips was a convenient place, even if they were overpriced and would under-deliver.  out of their many stylists, only a few actually know what they're doing; it shouldn't be that difficult for male hairstyles.  if i'm going to get a bad haircut where the stylist grinds the clippers into my scalp or blatantly ignores my description for my desired style, i might as well just go down a block to supercuts or whatever it's called (or even worse, doesn't know what i'm talking about) .i would say to specifically avoid tyler, and i wish that i remembered the other stylists who are terrible.  now that it's no longer convenient, i'm definitely not going back."
"went and got a free hair cut here with a coupon, it was alright. this place definitely has a great clips business model [in and out quick for a cheap price] they give you a free back massage and scalp massage but i ended up with a weird headache from all the crap they stuck in my hair. you get to watch sportscenter while getting your hair cut, which is cool but it turns weird and makes the haircut process more awkward [i feel weird making conversation with hair stylist, never can figure out why] but at least you now have an excuse to zone out while the cut is going on. i got a buzz [a 1] and they still shampooed my hair which was odd, but i guessin all it was pretty good for a free hair cut, i probably wont go again if i have to pay but if you find  a coupon go, they are nice enough people and give decent haircuts."
"if you're looking for a reasonably priced haircut, enjoy the company of cute and friendly girls, and like to watch sports, this place is for you.  i recommend the mvp.  if you're a salon snob this place is obviously not for you.  i don't understand why some of the other reviewers would walk into a place called sport clips expecting a snooty salon.  they must be simple, illiterate, or both."
"i have gotten three haircuts here now. the first two were above average, but this last one was terrible. she basically cut a bald spot into my head and now i find myself wearing a hat more often than not...thankfully its winter and it isn't weird looking.i wish i could remember her name to tell you not to use her, but i don't. fortunately for me, i remember her face and will ask to not have her cut my hair again.also, as an added bonus, you can take your receipt next door to uncle sammy's and get 50% your order."
"a lot of people have been waiting for this review. brace yourselves for the tale of how a night of drinking and bears football led to the worst cut of my life.i'm the son of a hair stylist. i grew up in a cosmetology school and spent years in salons. i can smell perm solution a mile away. i know how to perform colors, cuts and could probably to extensions if i needed to.when i left arizona, i had my first cut from someone other than my mother. i was lucky to find heather anderson, who kept me beautiful for years.upon moving to chicago, i linked up with allison at strange beauty show. again, fortune smiled upon me, and the streets of chicago were a little more beautiful with my coiffure prancing along them.in my entire life, i had never visited a stylist in anything other than a high-end, fashionable salon.then came a trip to lion head pub. during the bears vs vikings game, a pair of women started working the crowd in racy referee outfits. shot girls? strippers? referees?nope. they were hair stylists promoting sport clips, a salon that prides itself on less chit-chat and more tv. they offered me a coupon for the ""mvp treatment"": a haircut, steamed towel, shampoo and shoulder massage. for the sake of yelp and against my better judgment, i vowed to visit.as a man, i'm a bit offended by the sport clips concept. i'm not a 5-year-old. i actually enjoy talking with my stylist and discussing hair, style, salon goings-on and our personal lives. i don't need different rooms of the salon to have cutesy names. i don't need a remote control on my seat.sport clips doesn't take appointments. i'm told that's because men prefer to just walk in. i don't. i like to know my stylist will be ready when i'm ready. i schedule my next cut at the end of each salon visit. i own a day planner.so i arrive and wait 15 minutes for a stylist. while waiting, i'm left to watch college basketball with a bunch of kids. the plus side is most of the stylists are cute, and they all seem pretty cool, like punk rockers who just needed salon jobs.i was assigned to lauren, who is both cute and cool, and we discussed what i wanted done with my hair. lauren and i got along just fine and had a lot in common, so i got comfortable.then she sprayed a few squirts of water on my hair and got going ... with a straight razor ... on the back.i've been getting razor cuts for years, and i've never had anyone take a razor to the back of my head or start cutting without a shampoo. i decided to let her do her thing. maybe she knew something i didn't.while giving me a cut, lauren started talking about the different paul mitchell products she was using. i know what working on commission is like for a stylist. i know how much selling product helps the bank account. but i am an bumble & bumble addict, and i refuse to try anything else. after lauren did some bizarre thinning and texturing with scissor up top (and didn't use the razor there), she took me into a dark room for my shampoo and steam towel.as my eyes adjusted and i settled into the shampoo bowl, i noticed a giant fat head looming on the wall next to me.it couldn't be. no way. blue jersey, orange numbers, pale skin ...brian urlacher?yes, a life-sized brian urlacher in a tackling pose really is going to help me relax. mmmmmm.ok, here's the only part i enjoyed (other than meeting some nice stylists): the scalp massage and shampoo weren't the best i've had, but they were decent. the steam towel absolutely kicked nut. i felt refreshed and relaxed and cool. lauren applied a little pressure to my face, and i was in heaven.apparently, so was the guy sitting a few seats away. he started making slight moaning noises. maybe he was really into urlacher.lauren took me into the main room, which blinded me with bright lights. that would explain why i didn't notice that my hairline was too long, my backside was too bulky and my sideburns were cut too narrow. ""ready for your massage?""she should have asked ""ready to be jabbed in the back with a vibrator?"" because that's what she did. after about 30 seconds of vibration, i felt violently nauseous.in the end, i tipped $10 and gave lauren a free pass to the bravery. the salon isn't her fault. it's just a horrible business idea: take everything good about a salon and reverse it.as i was waiting outside for the bus, i noticed my head was still wet, which quickly turned to ice. thank goodness for my flask of bourbon and the cta.lauren, if you're reading this, i'm sorry. you're sweet, and i'm sure you do standard cuts very well. i'm just a salon snob, and i probably over-instructed you on your first cut with me."
visited there in 2008. it was the worst haircut i have received to date.
"dude the season ticket package rocks, you get 6 mvp haircuts for the price of 6 regular haircuts. they never expire so it's a great deal at $17 for a haircut that includes warm towel, this back massage thingymajjiger, massaging shampoo, the works!the staff is very friendly as well, not the fake friendly but the real friendly. they hire down to earth people.i had to subtract 1 star though because i brought in a photo of an old haircut and tried to get the same but it ended up being a generic short hair haircut which is fine. this place, like every other non-asian haircut place i go to loves to lop off my hair completely despite my wishes. it's ok though, if you want to cut off all my hair and leave none it just means i only need a haircut every 2-3 mths instead of every month.from a peer business perspective i don't know why these cutters don't err on the side of too-long rather than always making my hair too short. oh well, almost a 5 star, almost a 5 star."
"i had wandered far and wide, across the yuppie lakeview and back through the land of over privileged college kids who think they are too smart to vote (lincoln park) and finally found sportsclips. i promptly performed my devotion to the gods of good fortune and clean-cut grooming and entered the establishment. lucky for me, i didnt need an appointment.i had walked past this place many times before and wrote it off simply because i believed that since i was in chicago, i could find a nice local barber who would charge me less and do a better job than at a franchised salon like sportsclips. the pricing was a little intimidating at first, but i needed a trim so i was ready to pay up. i was met by a friendly stylist within the 1st 10 minutes and all i had to was say ""im going to a party of my boss's and i look like a hippie, please help me"" and i got a great haircut just like that, i never get it that easy at a barbershop. she also upgraded me to their top package (cut, shampoo, hot towel, massage) for no extra charge which was nice. i walked out looking and feeling good with a card of coupons giving me cash discounts for my next 5 visits. good hair cuttery for any guy who needs a simple, professional looking haircut."
"finally the staff were professional, friendly, and amazing. especially hedit i took in my son for his first haircut and she was patient and sweet she the real mvp."
"i'm not surprised to see a low rating for this location. sports clips is where i've been getting my hair cut for a decade now.sarah was my stylist, and sarah does not like to adhere to the slogan, ""the customer is always right."" and when you're cutting people's hair, that's really something you need to believe in.why i want my hair shampooed first is irrelevant. again, for the past 10 years this has never been an issue for me. i've had fabulous experiences at other sport clips locations. she did not want to do that, and insisted on explaining to me why it was a bad idea. when i told her i'd like it before, she gave me the shampoo. however, she didn't offer me the steam towel, or scalp massage, even though she charged me for the triple play. when i asked why i didn't receive it, she said, ""because we normally do that at the end."" very petty, and unprofessional.i've only ever had two bad experiences at a sport clips, and this was definitely one of them. i do not recommend."
"i've been going to myra g. for my haircuts since 2004. she's professional, friendly and courteous. i've even changed locations with her when she moved from knox st. to greenville ave. location. i'll be back!"
the cut was decent and they provide you with discount coupons for future visits. though the lowest cut costs $23 which was including shampoo
literally download the app and made a brand new yelp just to post this horrible rating. if you want a hair cut in a timely matter than i would not recommend sport clips. only had one person working at 2:30 in the afternoon and insisted it would atleast a 30 min wait period. on a thursday. that is ridiculous. it was only me and one other gentleman waiting. we both left. terrible job and another lady left as i walked in. yal need more dedicated workers. sorry
i most certainly would not recommend this place had the worst experience yesterday evening as i walked in a older black lady decided to cut my hair . i asked her if there was still time   horrible decision she cut my hair in less ten minutes then  didn't want to wash it   not to mention that blending absolutely horrible guys i don't recommend this place i had decided to give it another chance a few months ago i had this young girl cut my hair of course it was not what i wanted so if you go get your haircut run away from this lady black older lady she has horrible customer skills not good at doing haircuts i don't know why they hire these people they deserve no stars ..  fyi  this not my name
"wish i could give 0 stars to this place. terribly rude and incompetent staff.  maria is a nightmare, screaming at kids and their parents because she can't handle children's haircuts.  never waste your time or money here."
i use to love coming to sports clips but since i've moved away from my normal sports clips the service has really gone down. i've come to this location a few times and the service was okay. it seams no matter what time i come they are always short a barber or the wait time is over an hour. if i didn't live so far from my original sports clips i went to i would never come. sports clips you've lost a long time customer!!!!!!!' looks like it's time to find a new place for a haircut.
"so it's not a bad deal if you can get them to use your coupon. first timers get the vip for the price of a regular hair cut which clearly says 15 on the the wall but they tell you 21. before i got to use my first timer discount i asked about the yelp coupon which they had no idea what it was on the yelp app. service was great fast and easy. there was a long wait i understand because what they were offering cut, wash, message. don't know if i would go back tho."
after reading the reviews i am glad they wouldn't cut my hair.  i walk in at 7:55 pm and they say they are closed. they are on a different time than the rest of the world. google and at&t say they are open. i asked for the manager and i get a rude women saying they are closed and they are not cutting anymore hair.  poor customer service!!!!!
we've been waiting for over an hour for a cut. they're more concerned about cleaning the facility so they can leave than taking care of the customers who have been here for the last hour. we're watching them clean as we continue to wait.poor customer service.
yesterday i was having a not so chill day. just another day full of errands and getting my hair cut was one of those errands. to be honest i actually did not like sports clips at all. every time i have gone in the employees never seem too excited to cut hair. there have been times when i feel kind of reluctant to ask for the shampoo service because it seemed as though my stylist didn't want to cut my hair let alone wash it. honestly if they didn't want to do it i didn't want to make them do it. but yesterday was different. jennifer took care of me yesterday before i had to rush into work. she was outstanding. i went in for a simple hair cut and to me i thought my hair cut was just an easy one. even though the style was simple she still didn't rush me and she still paid attention to detail. also she didn't have an attitude and was very welcoming. she's a hard worker in my opinion and i will for sure come and see her every time if i can.
this sport clips is pretty much like any other. it's a good idea with some good hair stylists and some not so good hair stylists.i personally have only had one poor experience and that was at different location. i have been to this one around 8 or so times so i honestly only have positive thoughts towards it!first edit:ask for mindy. easily my favorite stylist. and personally i think the best.~carpe diem~
horrifying this people have no idea how to cut hair shaved my boyfriend bold when we clearly told them how to cut and show the picture. 20$ of horror please save another 20$ and go to boarsroom for cut.amen
"great location, great team and great experience.  the crew was is friendly and thoughtful."
"$19 + tip is a bit much for as simple buzz cut without the ""vip service"". floyd's, a higher end place, is cheaper."
should have looked at yelp first. so disappointed.i asked for a very simple haircut and the first time i came here in late september the lady was pretty good added some notes to my account so i was excited for the follow-up to hopefully get a nice cut. i never go to these chain places but i'm new to the area and haven't found a nice barbershop yet.when i came in today the lady sat me down i told her give me a 3 on the sides blended to shorter hair on top. i showed her do not go any higher than this part of my head or it will look bad. she said that's what the notes say no problem. after she starts off it went well and was looking good. she asked me how it looked i said perfect don't go any higher. she says ok and after cleaning up my neck she then decides to shave up the side of my head way too high now i have a fo-hawk. when i told her to fix it she said that's what i asked for. she washed my head and when i looked in the mirror i was horrified i walk to the counter said she messed up my hair. the lady said that's what i asked for and the girl at the counter still charged me $14 which was half off. i went and purchased clippers at wal-mart for $24 so hopefully i'll be able to salvage my hair. feel free to contact me and i'll cut anyone's hair for $5 in the north dallas addison area and save you the money and guarantee it to look better than this rip-off joint
"love the place and the ability to watch sports while getting a haircut is a plus.  the only thing keeping it from 5 starts is the randomness of who you get to cut your hair and the levels of service you get are different.  however, overall i give it 4 out of 5 and still recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice easy cut."
best hair cut ever love the staff very clean shop.we have been coming to this location for a long time and will continue.
if you get the girl with plastic surgery walk out the door. she does it in 2 minutes and does a horrible job.
"i've been going to sportclips for about 5 years.  i don't have a specific person i use every time meaning no matter who cuts my hair, they do a good job.  and the triple play is a great deal.  cut, hot towel, shampoo and head massage for $22."
"i have taken my teenage son to this location twice and both times, he has walked out with bad haircuts.  once it was uneven around the ears (by a full inch!) and the other time - when we revisited with the free haircut coupon they gave as an apology - it was crooked in the back at the neckline.  if you get your hair cut here, i highly recommend really checking it out in the mirror before leaving.  the people who ""fix"" bad haircuts do a great job but it's a hassle having to have his hair cut twice because the first person can't cut hair."
great job today! new online booking system is active now (i was first customer) and i was in and out within 15 mins today. awesome job. i'll be back
"i usually go to barber shops because of results like this but this specifically was an all time low. i came in and everyone was friendly. to be honest, i'm sure everyone else there could've cut better. however, i got an asian lady who doesn't know anything. as former military, i have always asked for a ""high and tight"". i said this and i've never looked more confused. that was my first bad sign. i then proceeded to explain what that was, (i still can't get over how someone who cuts hair doesn't get that), and she did literally that. my top was 1.5 and my sides were 0. no blending. i had to ask for her to fix it. i don't get it. also, the clippers were pulling my hair the entire time. any good barber knows when it is but she continues carelessly. i mentioned it to her and she looked confused and just sprayed cleaner on the clippers. she then continued to cut my hair even as it pulled more. i swear i doubt she even has a license to cut hair. i then also had to ask for her to make my sides shorter since a high and tight is clean. so she then pushed the clippers into my head more try to dig my hair out so it would be closer.... even though she could've just taken off the clip or used the shaver sitting right in front of her. to summarize, she didn't know how to cut hair at all and i doubt she is even licensed to. i don't mind that she barely knew english but i do mind that she doesn't know how to do her job. worst experience and haircut ever received. it's unfortunate considering i work in coppell and talk to hundreds of people ever week. i will make it my prerogative to warn everyone about this horrible spot. shaking my head."
"after i walked in to a nearly empty place, i was rushed into the chair. the woman cutting my hair was clearly trying to get me out of there. i went to sports clips for the mvp, and had to request one, she never offered, which i just thought was a little weird. the whole thing was super rushed, and the haircut was just ok. the back of my neck still stings 45 minutes later, as well. i definitely recommend trying another barber in the area."
"if you are looking for a good, basic haircut at a somewhat reasonable price, this place will do.  the friendliness of the staff varies, depending upon who you get.  there is a fair amount of turnover as well, so if you don't like the staff this week, try again in a few weeks."
no customer service. bad attitude. looks like stylists are not looking forward to having customers.donot recommend this location.
"rude rude rude!!!! i walked out, i don't understand how they employ people with sour attitudes. i walked in, smiled and said hello. i was greeted with a ""have you been here before"" as if i was wasting her time. they need to hire a new staff!!"
decent haircut but way too pricey at $20 for a standard cut without the frills or even a wash.
i got a great haircut and not to mention 1st time visitors get a free hair wash and neck and shoulder message!
"one of the best locations in area.  pricey haircuts, but worth it."
"i've been to several sports clips, and this must have been the few times i didn't feel welcome. it could be that the only thing on tv was duke vs uconn.. women's basketball, and perhaps i wasn't in the talking mood after eating a ridiculous amount of garlic.. but it was a quick haircut which i needed since i'm hardpressed for time as a full-time student (wow that was a run-on sentence). also, not really thrilled they wouldn't take my $5 coupon although i will admit that it was from another store, but i've been to other stores where they have. sucks because i probably won't go back even though this is the closest location to me because i don't feel like paying so much for a haircut which the stylist said i should come in once every two weeks for (i understand it is her livelihood though). therefore, if you like pricey but quick haircuts and hopefully the stylist will be in a better mood (didn't even tell me her name), this is a decent place to get hair cut and not miss any sports action.otherwise, keep the fro a little more and wait for a competitor's coupon like me!"
"i've been coming to this sports clips for the better part of a year now, and i just went in today for maybe the 5th time. first, this location has recently been renovated. 4 large flat-screen hdtvs with sportscenter or a live game on constantly ensure that no matter which way you are pointed during your haircut, you'll have a good viewing angle. the back room where your hair is washed and/or hot towel is applied is dark, comfortable and relaxing. stylists are friendly, although the woman who appears to be the manager of this location can be a little brash at times. sometimes you need to keep your interoffice ""talk"" to yourself or wait until there are no customers around to hear it. this alone is the main reason i cannot give this sports clips a 5 star rating.now, for the actual haircut:i am pleased with the consistency of the haircuts i have been getting. i have been going with a david beckham style cut, and they do an excellent job. i have been to a different stylist each time, and i have not had a bad experience yet. a hint to men: if you want your hair to look like someone or is a specific style, bring in a photo or save one to your phone and show it to your stylist...this is a secret women have kept for years, and i think if men just told their stylist exactly how they wanted it, some of these complaints would not occur.additionally:this was the first time i tried the mvp treatment (scalp massage, tea tree treatment, shoulder and neck massage, hot towel along with the haircut) and i was pleasantly surprised. i had passed on previous visits because it just seemed like an up-charge, but decided to give it whirl this time. it is well worth what some may think is a steep cost ($24), and considering that is what some people will pay for a large pizza that lasts all of 30 minutes, i think it is a justified cost.no, it's not a high-end salon, but it also doesn't charge the $60 that a high-end salon would...so there it is.i will be returning for another cut in a few weeks.  i recommend this place for men and boys...obviously, i can't speak to women getting their hair done here, but sports clips caters to men, so i would not recommend women try it, unless you want the latest miley cyrus look..."
"do not ever fall for the ""we are not busy, you will get right in.""  arrive and get 30 min wait. too much yapping and not enough clipping.   go somewhere"
"came from san diego, ca where the barbers are some of the best in the world. shopped around barbers here in dallas and either it's over priced or all hype. came to sports clips for my two sons and kayla hooked them up. both of my sons hair was better than mine. i've been having her cut all of our hair since. about a year now and i recommend everyone to kayla. it's definitely not a typical sports clips cut."
stopped in today to get a haircut with no particular stylist in mind and guess as luck would have it i got jessica.  jessica did an amazing job and was super friendly.  i highly recommend her great personality and great job!
"long time user of this place, reasonably priced haircuts fast. i took my sons there all through high school. i felt compelled to leave a rating now because of their new payment system. i'm old and bald. i have very little hair. my haircut takes literally 5 minutes with a #2 and costs $16. reasonable. what set me off is that their new payment system puts a ""minimum"" tip on my transaction of $5. on a $16 haircut? 31%? sure, i can change it. i have to select ""other"", then type in a new amount, click ok, all while the girl that just cut my hair watches me change the amount knowing full well what the minimum is. i just want to pay quickly and leave. not sure i think a 30% tip is ok when pretty much anybody with a steady hand could cut my hair, the hardest part is cleaning up my neck and around my ears.i'll be looking elsewhere, sadly."
"we have taken my three year old son multiple places trying to get a decent, well-done haircut. we finally found it at sport clips!! he enjoyed watching the tv while getting his haircut. the stylist did a very good job of trimming around his ears and neck, which are often neglected in kids haircuts. also, he got a sucker and a ball, so he's already asking to go back!! this is one happy momma!"
kayla cut my 15 year old son's hair today.  we walked right in - no waiting!  she did a great job and was personable.  went here on a recommendation and will be going back.
we've loved this location! i bring both my boys here for haircuts and we love alana!! she always does a great job and is very detailed. highly recommend her!
the girls are nice but can't really cut hair the way they are supposed to..i had a simple hair cut but she couldn't really tapper up properly.
unlike everyone else... the girls are awesome they always do a great job on my hair and i will always be back.
"i drive all the way over here for fort worth every three weeks just to get a hair cut from jessica. i stumbled in here around a year ago refuse to go anywhere else or let anyone else cut my hair. im a 33 year old veteran and cant ever remember getting a better hair cut from anyone else. after taking my stepson to several places in fort worth and them ruining his hair we no longer get his haircut from anyone else, but jessica. its always been clean and the people are always so nice. come here, see jessica and im pretty sure you wont be disappointed, especially if you're super picky with your hair like me."
"just don't go here!asked for a simple hair cut and the lady messed it up. had a long cut on the back my neck, thanks to the horrible trimmer."
i have been going here for years and the customer service is great! jessica is the one always cutting my hair and she does an awesome job!
"the worst haircut of my life! she was finished in 3 minutes, rushing to help next customer.  i asked the lady to point cut my hair because i have curly hair and straight lines show. she didn't do anything i asked, the manager got all defensive and states she would have done it even faster, & that they don't normally do point cut with scissors and she's been cutting hair for 8 years. whoopidiedooo, every customer is different and should be treated special and giving te service they want and deserve, i felt like cattle getting a shot and then kicked in the butt telling me to get!"
"i have been to this place no less than 10 times. the only reason i keep going is that it is so convenient for me, since i work right across the street. i finally had to call it quits yesterday. i thought i had finally found one lady there who gives a half decent haircut. i get home, and realize that she forgot to cut about 1/4 of my hair towards the front. now i have hair the length of about a #5 for most of my head, and my hair is the original length in the front. i can assure you it looks ridiculous.the ladies that work here are the nicest women you will ever meet, they just have no idea how to give a thorough haircut. i've had issues from one girl trimming the area + 1/2 inch behind my ears, to various stylists leaving one area of my hair longer, to a stylist forgetting to blend the sides into the top. i have no problem when my hairstylist wants to strike up a conversation with another stylist, but when the quality of the product they produce is so crappy, it gets frustrating. along with the other review on here, i do always feel rushed. it feels like they know they are making mistakes, and want to cover them up by making you leave. fortunately for them, there are no other establishments that are close with their hours."
"most i've ever paid for a haircut ($17 pre-tip, i got the lowest-priced one), and it wasn't worth it. while i always get a very simple cut, it felt like i was being rushed out of there. the whole thing took less than five minutes and she didn't do a very thorough job on my sideburns or removing excess hair. i was one of only two people there, so you'd think i might be treated better.also, website mentions free upgrade for first-time sports clips visitors, but i wasn't offered any, despite them knowing it was my first time.i'll take the $5 special at my local shop next time, thank you very much."
worst haircut of my life. stay away from this place unless you want to look like a clown. they hire young girls with no clue on how to cut hair. butchered my hair with uneven side burn. next time i would prefer to cut my own hair than visit this rip off spot.
"okay - you've heard from the rest - now hear from the best, lol. no, seriously though, i have been going to this location for 3 years. the first time i ever stepped foot in the joint i came with my brother. he went first and it was like the other guys said - a fast quick hair cut that did not look like anything extra special - but it didn't look bad either - it was a hair cut - which we came for - surprised right?  - don't figure.  next i was up, she took about 20 minutes cutting my hair and complimenting me about how thick and soft my hair was. she may have even fondled my head a bit, which felt good. when she was all done it looked like a nice cut. it's funny cause when we left my brother said       "" i'm not coming back here again, she only spent 5 minutes on my hair and she spent 20 minutes on yours ! ""       the fact that neither one of us had a better quality cut then the other did not even matter to him - it was just that she was with me longer. i chose to go back and have had my hair cut several times since then. sometimes my hair gets cut quicker, and sometimes it takes longer. i think it just depends on who is cutting, and what is on the girls mind when she is cutting. anyway, if you are a guy that likes chics ( which i really do, lol ) then come here and you should be pleased. they have flat screen high def tv's with sports channels always on and a sports theme. they also do massage and neck rubs which feel really great. i honestly can't remember ever having a bad experience here, or at any of the other locations either. true, the price is a little higher than other places - but - if you can't afford the price go to great clips and leave these sports clips girls for me !!"
"the girl was pleasant but she scratched the back of my neck badly!  i have big red scratches on my neck.  i have an easy buzz cut, didn't even have to use scissors and it was still $17.  definitely not worth it.  if you're a man, go to a proper barber.  these types of places are a sham."
"i have been a sport clips customer for more than 4 years.  i have not had a bad experience at any location and i have been to several in multiple states.  i have been to multiple locations in the lakewood and uptown areas and i love this branch.  although the parking can be a bit of s pain, i have never had a problem with any of the stylists. my favorite is april and over the years she has cut my hair the most.  she is always friendly and does a great job. i will keep coming here and keep recommending them to my friends"
"had a horrible haircut experience here. been a few times but 3rd time was my last. the experience left me scared, literally. posted pictures. beware of the cheetah taped clippers."
go get a cut here if you want the most wack cut bruh. overpriced and no skill or talents needed whatsoever to get a job here. the wait and price do not match the quality of the haircut. i could get my mom to cut my hair for free and still have better quality than this. i could even cut my own hair by myself and it would still be better than y'all and save money and live better (walmart). if i could put my hair back and get a refund i would do that and use that money to get it cut somewhere else. definitely going back to the barbers back in garland that only charge around $5 and actually give you your money's worth.
"love this place. april does a great job managing this location, and she gives great hair cuts. not sure why there are so many negative reviews on here. been coming here for over 5 years and i have always had a good experience."
"although the hairstylists come and go, they seem to recruit good ones. this store can get kind of busy, so don't worry, because they have sports playing on every tv. april does a great job managing the place and correcting any mistake."
"this sports clips has the worst owner/management.  if you come to get a haircut in june/july/august, prepare to bake in the waiting area.  the sunlight will scorch your skin because management is too cheap to apply tint or blinds to make waiting customers comfortable.  i have made multiple suggestions and filled out comment cards, but to no avail.  supercuts on lemon is not far from this location and guess what?  they treat customers like customers...not like uncooked cookie dough.  tip for management:  adding tint or blinds will decrease your energy costs as well as minimize these harmful social media critiques.sincerely,baked cookie"
"pretty terrible choice to get a haircut at this place. i had previously never been to a sport clips before, and after the haircut i received, i will never visit one again. i was in on friday to get a pretty easy haircut, clippers on the sides and faded towards the top, super easy, i thought. the girl cutting my hair didn't seem to have a clue, i unfortunately noticed this too late. my hair is completely crooked and i actuall had to go to super cuts, to get it fixed. how crappy is that, supercuts is a step up from this place, and about $7 cheaper. this place already has bad reviews and i should've listened. believe me, all the bad reviews are accurate. skip this place. i'm fairly certain this is the type of place that probably doesn't give a shit about reviews, but you guys ate in big trouble if you can't even pull off my simple haircut. pathetic."
"wow. don't even know where to begin. this is the worst place to get a hair cut. i told the lady to give me a 2 on the side, blend it in and trim the top. she have me a 1 on the side, no blending and a slight trim on the top. my hair looks like dumb and dumber. i could not believe my eyes. she started in the back of my head so i couldn't see what she was doing, be the time she got to the side, i immediately asked her wtf she was doing?... do not go here. i have been to millions of sports clips and this place is the worst haircut i've ever received in my life. i look like i'm going to be in a ufc fight or punk rock band. incredible, i had to go to floyd's 99 barbershop to get my hair fixed. listen to the other reviews, do not go here!!"
i followed april over from another sport clips location she's the best in dallas. she cuts my daughter's hair too & is great with little kids.
"this was the worst experience i've ever had!! even worse than the time i was a young child and my barber accidentally clipped my ear. the person that cut my hair was in a bad mood. she was snappy and very unfriendly. i never go to places such as great clips, supercuts, knockouts or sports clips. i was in desperation mode due to my regular stylist being out of town and my backup barber was out for lunch. i have a head full of hair and was looking to get cleaned up around the edges, sideburns trimmed, etc. well i sat in the chair and within 10 minutes the person cutting my hair said she was finished. at that point i just wanted to get out of there so i paid and left. i have been inactive from yelp for almost 3 years and this experience caused me to say something about it in order for others to be spared. don't do it! let your kids cut your hair instead. they'll do a better job."
update - this place has pulled off a 180 and now i am a frequent customer.  they hired a new manager april who is awesome and cuts my hair very well. all the staff are friendly but i cannot speak to how they cut hair since i request april every time i go in. amazing how the right person can make a world of difference.
website says they open at 9:00am.  they changed to open at 10:00 am and did not update the website! thanks for the wasted hour!
i've been to this location three times since i moved to the area. each time has gotten worse. i can agree with other reviewers' comments in saying the people who work there are friendly but that's where i'll stop. needless to say i'll be trying another sportsclips for my next haircut.
"i wouldn't go here again.$20 for a mens trim, scalp massage, and back massagethe scalp massage is them putting conditioner in your hair, the back massage consists of them holding a plastic massage toy to your back for about 10 seconds.not happy with the hair cut either."
"the stylist was so timid with the clippers, she ended up just butchering my fade.  she then had to ask the other stylist who was working ""how to blend a fade"".  what?!  apparently she was sick or skipped class that day they taught how to blend.  i asked for a trim on top, and she ended up cutting maybe a millimeter off the top.  i pointed out mistakes in my haircut and she kept trying to ""fix"" the problem.  i finally told her to stop before my hair was not repairable (going to have to go pay another barber shop to fix this joint's mistakes).  i got the mvp (cut, massage shampoo, hot steam towel, and shoulder massage).  the hot towel was more a little less than luke warm.  when she was done with the shampoo and asked if i wanted any product, i said no i'll just put my cap back on.  she said, okay we are done then....with my hair still dripping wet.  she never offered or did dry my head.  on top of that, she didn't do the shoulder massage.  and at the end still had the nerve to charge me full price ($23) for my horrible haircut experience...and the girl knew she had done a very poor job!!  avoid this location!!!!"
"my wife was helping to give me a no-frills buzz cut when my clippers crapped out. i went down the road to sport clips to let them finish the job. after finishing the buzz cut, they had the nerve to charge me $19. apparently they have a standardized pricing system- what a rip off. when i got home, my wife noticed they had left a couple patches of long hair strands in some not so inconspicuous places. they have really improved my overall feelings toward supercuts. i will never go here again."
"my husband and son go here once a month or so.  the staff is always very friendly and accommodates my 2 year old son.  i would say the cuts are good, not great, but definitely worth the moderate price.  for people looking for high-end cuts, this may not be your place, but for a quick, friendly, good cut, the staff here gets it done."
"great sports clips. weekends can be busy, but i've had no waits before. julie is a top notch stylist. i always see her if she's working."
michelle always does the best job on my sons hair-would recommend her to anybody. very clean and very professional location
have been going to this location for many years however there seems to have been a major change in staff.  just finished getting a haircut and was not pleased.  one of the worst haircuts i have received.  not sure if i will be returning...
"so, my first hair cut in dallas left me looking like i'd just escaped from a sanitarium circa 1950.  thankfully, i found sport clips after one of my co-workers suggested it to me.  if you take a look at my profile pic, you'll see a ... let's be honest... glorious beard.you can infer several things:  i'm not the sort of fellow who usually does anything other than a simple hair cut.  no shampoo, no product, no fluffery.  however, my first trip to sport clips included some free upgrade coupons.  and i'm a sucker for coupons.i was pleasantly surprised to find i rather enjoyed the hot towel, scalp treatment, and wash.  then, the stylist took out some sort of gasoline powered shoulder massager thing.  in the venn diagram of ""going to be shaken apart"" and ""deep muscle relaxation"" this hits the sweet spot of overlap which was not at all unpleasant.all told, since i left my usual barber back home in wv, sport clips has filled the niche pretty nicely.  oh, there's lots of sportsball paraphernalia and tv's if that's your thing.  if not $25 makes for a pretty nice, relaxing, pampering haircut.  but, with a set of coupons or a yelp check-in, all that's yours for $21 (plus tip, not included)."
"excellent service. always!!  i've been coming here for 3 years. they take good care of me and my son. they have had some air conditioning issues and construction in the area. they are always happy, polite sand willing to provide good service."
"can not fade men's hair. i've included pictures see for yourself. im afraid to go back to have them fix it. $25gc wasted plus the $25 value of the child's mvp haircut that was on the gc i purchased at a silent auction for a local elementary school pta fundraiser. i went to this location because i had a free mvp package gift certificate. my stylist seemed to be not paying attention the entire time. i listened to her buzz off a huge portion of hair in the middle of the fade (you can see in the pics) and she paused then acted like nothing happened she didn't try to fix it or mention it to me. instead she kept me in a position not looking at the mirror except face on at the end when i checked i knew something was off but couldn't tell from the chair. i couldn't see it until i got home. one side is rough but at least it's even and straight not faded very well though. the other side is where she buzzed off too much hair in the middle of the fade and it's just an uneven mess. the experience was also subpar. she slapped me in the face with the warm towel and said ""sorry i'm supposed to be pampering you not hurting you"". i was nice and said it was ok, at the time i thought it was just an accident so whatever. now i believe she was not paying attention during my entire visit. i felt like she was treating me poorly because i wasn't paying for my haircut. i bought the haircut at an elementary school fundraiser she should have been giving an extra special experience one would think. that's a waste of paid advertising. at the end when i said ""i normally spike the front of my hair up"" she offered some product and just threw it on my head and moved it a little. she asked me if i liked it and by this point i was really starting to see something was wrong with my haircut so instead of letting her touch my head again i did it myself. she didn't try to sell me any products for my hair which at the end of every sportsclips haircut i have gotten is what they do. oh yeah and during the haircut the staff talked to each other about the poor ventilation and other problems with the store as well as new owners. i hope the new owners see this and i hope to find a great sportsclips in dallas so far i'm 0-2 in california this chain is awesome."
"sports clips is a nice little chain for a barber shop, but here you'll find that they take customer service to a new level.  very professional, polite and i like the fact that these folks really care of meeting the customer needs, really driven by customer service.  the atmosphere is nice here, it's where someone can go to get a haircut, watch a little sports, and still get their money's worth.  great value!  i know i'll be back."
worse place ever. literally ever. i'm so pissed at how crappy my hair is. it's ridiculous. i'm about to go to anther hair cut place to get this piece of crap fixed. i wanted a medium fade lady said she knew what it was. she didn't. one side higher then the other. didn't have a double zero so had to use a zero and it looks horrible. i wasn't rude or anything but it just makes me very upset that i pay too much for a crappy haircut. 20 bucks for a hair cut that wasn't worth it.
this is a good place to get a hair cut. it is clean and the staff is friendly and experienced. they can give you any stlye cut you want.
"i normally don't write reviews but this has been the worst experience with a haircut place.  i collect3d a discount coupon from a friend and wanted to check out a new place.  it wasn't hard to find and had some parking spots around the area.  i walked into the store and no one would greet me. i went to the small and cramped waiting room to wait while the game was on.  it was a neat place for anyone who likes sports but hated that they only focused on men haircut. it was very stereotyping and it was uncomfortable.  after a while i went to the desk and inquired if there was a list so i can put my name down. they pulled it from behind the counter and threw it on the counter. they already made it clear they did not want to be there or to be bothered with any more customers.  i went back to the waiting room again and i saw people come and go rather quick. i was wondering why my name wasn't being called and went back to the front desk to see how much longer. they said a few minutes but people who were more attractive were mysteriously advanced in the list. it was several customer who signed in after me went ahead of me. at this point i was starting to get frustrated and thinking about walking out.  when i got up to head to the door, my name was called to be cut. the styles to did not introduce them selves and was very aggressive when cutting my hair. i almost thought it was going to have a bald spot due to the dull scissors ripping out a lot of hair with each cut.  i endured the process and at the end my coupon was refused.  they given me an excuse that it was expired, wasn't accepted by any sportclips and just didn't want to honor the coupon. i showed them that it was valid and had their companies logo on it. i don't understand why taking off $1 would cause this much of a headache. this is the first and will be the last time i would ever go back to this location.  i do belive it was the people there and not how a company would operate their business."
both my husband and son get haircuts here.  they both seem to like that it's cater just to guys.  the game is always on...whatever game that is lol.  they always look handsome so never any issues with the stylist.  my husband gets the mvp package with the hot towel and he loves it.
took our son for a haircut this week. wow! they sucked. his hair is all choppy and uneven. we had to take him to floyds to get it fixed (it was that bad). avoid.
"sports clips has consistently provided good haircuts at a very reasonable price for me and my son for years.  this location is run really well and the turnover in stylists in minimal.  like most businesses, sports clips has a customer relationship management (crm) system -- not unlike tom thumb or other local retailers.  so, yes, they ask for your phone number and/or email address, but it is not required.  if you provide the information, then they are able to keep records of how you cut your hair - thus minimizing the impact in stylist turnover.this is a fun location with a very friendly staff.  they always take exceptional care of me and i highly recommend it."
"i love sports and i like a hair cut every few months or so i can't go wrong with a place like this. i always get the triple play which is a hair cut a shampoo and a hot towel on your face.  the combination of the hot towel an shampoo is bliss. the staff is always friendly and helpful. weekends can be busy which equals a long wait, visit on a weekday to avoid the trouble."
"can't stand to go here.  took my son in for a haircut and was asked for my phone number which i gave (despite barely understanding what the receptionist was saying). then asked for his name, then asked again for the phone number and then asked yet again for his name. when asked if i could just get his hair cut i was met with silence and more tapping on the computer. a stylist walked up and then proceeded to ask the same phone number and name questions at which point i left. marginal haircuts at best which i normally have to correct when i get home and then this. will never set foot in this place again."
"almaz is a great stylist and i can say the same about her management skills. she made me feel like a million bucks! i am visiting from out of town so i just needed a quick clean up! she was able to step up and make my head look great! she gave me mvp treatment. if you're looking for a good haircut, a good conversation, she's personable and professional! thank you almaz!!!"
dominique cuts my hair there and she does an amazing job. she's outgoing and a pleasure to speak with. and it doesn't hurt that she's easy on the eyes.!  use the online app to reserve your spot and avoid the wait
i'm so mad after my cut here i forgot the cubans name. she didn't listen to what wanted. i said an inch to inch and half on the sides. 3/4 of an inch!  i have a part and comb to the side. she even screwed that up. i told her i don't like tea tree oil but she put it in insisting she had to. then she tried again later. i told her to listen to what the customer wants not what you want to do. i came home and my wife had to trim the hatchet job on the top. worst cut in years!! the other stylists seemed to do what the clients wanted. never again with her.

"..when it's good, it's good.  why take ten minutes of my day to write a review?... because i should. after years of having reasonable hair cuts (i have straight easy hair to cut) i recently had a couple bad experiences. i came to this sports clips really with no expectations, but what i got was an enthusiastic, caring, skilled stylist who was invested in her customers and committed to her work. i got a great hair cut, shampoo, scalp massage and was reminded i can come back in a couple weeks for a free neck/ear hair trim. give this place an opportunity to impress you. tell them what you are looking for in the long run to earn your business... i think you will be pleasantly surprised."
"you can't go wrong getting a haircut at this place.  the staff are friendly and no appointment is necessary.  you have 2 different options for cuts and always get a complimentary neck trim in-between cuts.  the have a full line of hair care products available and are willing to help you select the best product for your needs.the lineup includes:mvp - precision haircut, hot steamed towel, massaging shampoo, tea tree shampoo & leave-in conditioner, neck and shoulder treatment leaves you refreshedtriple play - precision haircut, hot steamed towel, massaging shampoo, tea tree shampoo & leave-in conditioner"
"vickie was unbelievably rude and unprofessional to my husband, who tried to be nothing but friendly at first...despite her poor attitude. if you're going to be in the profession of dealing with customers...you might want to try and treat those paying customers with a little more courtesy. if not...find another job."
"great team the store cant be more perfect and wonderful management, i have had several experiences with this location , and overly satisfied with stylist and ssrvice."
"best haircut experience in the dfw area. cheap, quick, friendly, stylish, what else do you need."
"i've been going here for several years now.  alma is the team leader here and she does my hair most of the time.  she is both down to earth and pleasant, plus cuts my hair exactly how i like it.  that is saying something since i am not good at describing what i like.  i usually give ""artistic license"" initially and hope for the best.  she hit it right from the beginning and remembers what we did each time.the facility is clean and well run, too.  as for prices, there are always coupons and they have frequent haircuts program, too.  you can sign up on the corporate web site to get emailed specials.overall, i can't say what i would do better.  the only thing i would like (and this is a corporate...not local...thing) is i would love shaves.  they do have a vip which includes a small massage of the face and back.  naturally, i do that every time."
"just got out of there. easily one of the worst haircuts i have gotten, and i have short hair so it's pretty simple. it is uneven, not faded whatsoever like i asked. ultimately i am too nice to say anything, but it's garbage honestly."
"i am not sure where to start..with the price of the regular haircut vs the total hair count on my head or the clippers vs scissors cut?obviously, getting a regular haircut now days is more than just sitting down in a chair and having someone who gives the impression they know what they are doing cut the hair evenly...keyword here is evenly.  it now is all about up-selling from the bottomline price. the cut today was a repair job from another one of the high volume hair cutting franchises, so i did have tolerance that it might take several cuts to get that mess straightened out.  still..sports clips' insistance to use the gauged clippers needs to be stopped.  this time the gauged slip on hay rake style cutter was over ridden since the clippers were not 'cutting it'..(pun fully intended).fortunately i had the manager of the store cutting my hair and she quickly went to using scissors..which really is the only way to cut most people's hair. in most of these volume cut establishments the hair stylist have not been trained to use anything but the gauged cutters. i realize it takes more time and these places only make money by cutting as many heads as they can an hour, but when you are the only person in the joint..it would seem the norm would be to go for quality instead of quantity.my overall cut was ok..it is just the feel that the focus was not on the hair cut but the products and services they wanted to add on to make more money.  there was no feel of making a new customer a lifelong relationship as most  barber shops strive to do. this more modern concept of up-selling everything and hiring average stylist is one of the reasons most men will not go to one of these franchises.but, it is cheap and it is fast and that was was what i was after this trip..next time, i would like to think if i am the only person there that i am not feeling like they are trying to turn a $12 haircut into a $50 experience...ain't going to happen."
"great haircut, friendly staff!  i had 20 minutes between appointments, and they accommodated me immediately!  i'll come here again.n.b.   you don't need to be into sports, and if you are, there are extra perks."
i take my son here. they have his haircut saved in their system so it's always easy and pain free. they do a good job around his ears too. i am always happy.
it's like other sports clips.. but this one seems to be a bit roomier and their tv's are larger.. additionally.. they have haircuts for 10 bucks from 9-11 am from monday to thursday.. not a bad deal.. btw.. they don't take american express..
does anyone know what happened to maria? she cut my hair for the last 3 years and now she no longer works at this location. she's the only person that can cut my hair and i was hoping to find out where she works now if anyone knows. #findmaria
"do not go here!!!  first story, a year ago i went in for a basic hair cut, one of the asian ladies took me back. i had to finally stop her because she had screwed my hair up so bad. i ended up leaving and going to knockouts to see if they could fix it which was a no go so i had to shave my head to even it out.a year later i take my two sons in to get their haircut. when you go in a girl will great you at the counter but just stands there while you do a self check in at a computer, seriously she just stands there the whole time while you fill out your life story on the computer. my younger sons hair cut was fine but my older sons is not fixable. she did a line on the side which is what he usually has but she went all the way to the skin and it curved along the side. the sides were cut way uneven and she covered his hair in gel before she had me come and look at it. it was so bad i just told him to get out of the chair so we could go somewhere else.checkout process again involves you doing the work and checking yourself out. however they could not get it to automatically check us out so we had to wait while they played around with it. i asked if i could just pay them directly and they ignored me, i asked again and was told no. again save your money and go somewhere else."
"sadly this location lives up to (more appropriately down to) its reputation. my butcher.... erm stylist was maria. maybe it's the same person mentioned in other reviews but who knows, it's a common name. the first 3/4 of the cut was ok, even though she moves like edward scissorhands when cutting. the end it took a terrible turn, she turned me toward the door and busted out the clippers again, no biggy some final touch ups, right?  noooope.  she rounded all of her scissor work to a point and i'm stuck with this garbage haircut. had the mvp and do not recommend it at this location (maybe just this stylist). either way it was not a good experience and i will not be back to this location. of the 10-15 sport clips i've been to throughout the usa this is only the second bad experience. read the reviews before you go."
"this review is for the stylist maria. she's cut my husband's hair twice, and both times he's come home with completely uneven hair. anyone without a license to cut hair could do better. this second time she cut his hair, he tried to tell her about many areas that she needed to fix but regardless he came home with uneven hair. i don't understand how she can't see that it's obviously uneven. i'm also posting a picture for reference of the haircut received on 7/15/17. i understand that sports clips is not a high class salon, but the stylists should be able to cut hair evenly. he's not high maintenance, either. buzz the sides and trim the tops. apart from maria, every other stylist (not sure on names) he's been to have cut his hair perfectly with no problems, and we have no other complaints about the salon."
people rating this a 2 are crazy. i had a fantastic experience. same as i've had at my home one. staff great. prices same. perfect.
great cut.  no clue why the low stars. i don't even live here and i come here when in town. great staff and quick in and out.
"first off, this is no grade-a, $100 haircut stylist--it is a sport clips. i come here expecting mediocrity and am plenty satisfied with the haircut i depart with. the ladies, if you treat them with respect and compassion, will respond well when you don't take a liking to how they are cutting your hair or if you have a last-second change of heart (which i have done!). of my 10+ haircuts here, only one experience was truly bad. i had to actually come back to get it fixed because i couldn't take how it looked. but she was friendly and apologetic about the whole thing, and of course didn't charge me anything.i would say they should lower the prices, but $20-25 is pretty standard these days for a haircut. you really aren't going to find that much cheaper.a good experience overall. oh and if you want buzz cuts, which i think 80% of its customers receive, then this is the place for you.~carpe diem~"
"i've had 5 haircuts here, 4 of them left my hair patchy and uneven. the last time i was there, which will be the last time i ever go, the woman was trimming my head with scissors to finger length, and half way through got distracted and started trimming my ears without finishing the top of my head. then she washes it, and if i hadn't said anything she would have let me walk out! with huge chunks of my hair uncut!also, way overpriced for the quality of the work and the time they spend on it. stay away."
"having been to this place about 10 times, i'm no longer giving them the benefit of the doubt. multiple ""stylists"" of theirs will pretend to listen to what you want done to your hair and then will precede to ignore it. twice i've specifically asked for an undercut, shown the stylist pictures, and instead received another buzz cut fade. the mvp package of having a ""shoulder massage"" is just them attacking your back with a giant vibrator for like 20 seconds. this place may as well be a factory for buzz cuts because they sure are garbage at everything else."
"great haircut, friendly staff, oh the shampoo is awesome.   nice relaxing massage.   well worth the $$"
i normally go to floyd's to get my hair cut however i was pressed for time today so i thought i would try this place. might be one of the worst hair cuts i have ever gotten. i seriously think i could have cut my own hair better. trust me when i say stay away from this place.
"i go here regularly and always ask for the same stylist, savannah, and she does a great job.the trick is finding the right stylist to get your hair done to your liking. not sure if this is the case too with floyd's as the other reviewer mentioned, i'm too nervous to try another place."
"imagine walking into a huge smelly locker room with a bunch of amateur type barbers. this is the place.  if you want to get that feeling like you never left a smelly steamy locker room full of hockey players that never washed their ""lucky"" jersey, then by all means, make yourself at home with an overpriced haircut.  when i got my hair cut, i specifically told the lady ""do not layer the top of my hair with the straight edge"" and guess what she did? awesome listening skills huh.  this place reminds me of a used car lot except with so-called stylists.  i certainly hope this place closes down and something less scary appears in its place."
"make sure u tell them not to cut you too high in the back, they won't even ask before buzzing 4"" off your neck line leading to ingrown hairs, pain, and a shiddy cut.my advice, the asian girls are the only stylists that can give you a decent cut.wtf is up with the softball on tv.  it would be smart to have sports that suit their target market on the tele"
"a coworker goes here and was raving about the place. ""it's great"", he said, ""they even give you a massage"". so i thought i'd try it. i did...twice, and here's what i have to report:- they have no idea how to cut hair, other than maybe buzz cuts.i have somewhat curly hair. both times it looked alright immediately after the haircut, while it was still wet. but when it dried, it was extremely uneven and i looked as if i had lost a fight with the clippers. i had different stylists each time, which is the only reason why i gave them a second chance.- it's pricey for what you get. the ""mvp"" which includes the ""massage"" is over $20. great clips and other similar places are cheaper because they don't have the sports gimmick or the ""massage"", and you get about the same quality of haircut if not better. which brings me to the next point:- the so-called ""massage"" consists of them faintly pushing one of those cheap homedics massagers against your neck and shoulders for a little while. i was definitely disappointed, my coworker had made it sound like it was a real shoulder and neck massage.- they push their shampoos and conditioners extremely hard. both times, i was asked about 8 times if i wanted to buy any product.the ""sports experience""? underwhelming. both times i was treated to clips of the wnba and sports talk shows. but that's not as much their fault as espn 2 i guess. still they should have dvd's of ""great moments of the superbowl"" or something for those occasions...is that too much to ask?the most positive thing? after the haircut, they wash your hair with tea tree shampoo that leaves your scalp feeling all tingly and refreshed. but i can buy the shampoo and do that at home...."
"sport clips is a good chain.  fair prices for good services.i've visited many sport clips...this one has some of the best staff!  i've received haircuts from several of the staff and they all seem very qualified and skilled.marisela is one of the best.  great skills, great personality.great price point and seems like there's always a coupon or special available."
just got the worst haircut ever. they have no idea how to do a fade. place was dirty and now i've got a jacked up haircut that i have to deal with for the next week or two.
"i just got a terrible haircut....my hair isn't hard to cut. 2 on the sides, finger length and long enough to spike up. he cut it stupid short in front then didn't evenly trim my sideburns."
i've used sport clips for years but never this location before and never this location again. i was over charged what i have always paid for just a hair cut. staff seemed very uninviting and totally opposite of the normal upbeat welcoming reason i go to sport clips.
"rude staff. more interested in collecting your information, up selling, and pushing products than giving you a good haircut."
"finally received the perfect haircut. usually i go to a local old fashioned barber. i walk out of the other  ""area"" sports clips looking like i just got out of boot camp from the marine corps again. will continue to frequent this location."
rosy is the best. i came in with wild hair that had been growing for several months with no rhyme or reason and brought her a picture of what i wanted. absolute perfection. i could not be happier with how it came out.
"walked in at 20 til 6 on saturday, stylist told me we are closing and leaving at 6 and can't cut your hair. i've been going there for nearly 2 years, purchased the 6 mvp visits still have 2 left but with that level of disregard for their customers, as i also told her, i will never go back to this location!!!"
"eureka! i found a great place (and stylist) for a haircut in dallas on the first try! and, pun intended, my new stylists name is eureka! great location, no wait as promised when i called ahead, and a great 'mvp upgrage' for first timers. i will definitely be going back to this sport clips."
"eureka, took care of me.  she's quick, very conscientious and courteous.  hot towel, message and shampoo... $21 first timer.  i switched from super cuts!  i don't like games.  they also have hd tvs as each station."
"what a lucky break to find this first.  i have used the same master stylist in south florida for 7 years.  since my trips to dallas never lasted more than a month, i would wait until i returned to fl to get my hair cut.  but now that i'm here more and heading to other states, i had to find a good stylist in dfw.  i asked a young attorney that lives in the area where he got a recent cut that looked well done.  he turned me on to sports clips and now i am a regular (2 times so far).  i have a beard that i shape like iron man - tony stark and it is hard to keep shaped by myself.  i got it trimmed and shaped two weeks before going to sports clips for $26 plus tip ($40).  needing a hair cut before heading to a week of golf with the boys i decided i could live with a bad cut if i tried somewhere new.  that said, i took the referral and went here.i chose the ""most expensive"" service, which included shaping my beard for $25.  i went at lunch time to avoid a long wait since they do not do appointments.  i was next up for angelina.  what a great experience.  she cut my hair the way i asked, shaped and trimmed my beard, shampoo and condition with a hot towel on my face was next in another space.  finally, a scalp followed by a neck and shoulder massage completed the service.  at that point, it didn't matter how i looked...i felt great.  best of all though.  the cut and trim were perfect.  moreover, as a new customer, i got $5 off for a total of $20.  even though she can't use a straight razor, doing a beard and haircut for $20 is super inexpensive, especially considering how much time it takes.  i gave her a well deserved %100 gratuity and made sure to do the same the next time.  the scalp massage was even better the second time and now i'm planning to return more often when i'm in dallas."
about a year ago they were under bad management. now they have turned it around. great place for a guy to get a haircut and relax with a steam towel and a massage. neck trims are free in between mvp haircuts and you watch sports while they doing it.
i've been going to this place for a couple years now and they always take good care of me. plus who doesn't love a free trim.
"they always do a great job. this is my ""go to"" barbershop in dallas. the price is right, the girls are talented and the haircuts look great. the ladies are always very social and the wait usually doesn't take too long unless you go on saturday. i am not a huge fan of the new computer system because after filling all of my info in, there is a ""start over"" button at the end that is right next to the ""finished"" button. this resulted in my clearing all my fields and having to redo it (aka - pain in the ass).overall, it is a very good barbershop. i would recommend it."
"my husband just came back, picture attached.  how in the world is this even possible from a professional hairdresser!!??  so when i went back, they gave me a free coupon for a haircut, and said the manager just left, sorry, come back tomorrow.  really??  i'm completely shocked!!"
i've been coming here on-and-off since i moved to dallas in 2004. i've never had a bad experience but once you find a barber that you like the turnover can be high. sportclips needs an app so you can reserve a spot in line otherwise you can wait quite a while for your barber to be available and you don't know their schedule until you walk in the door or call ahead.i didn't use the word hair stylist because it's more of a barber type place then it's up to you to style to your liking. the rewards and coupons are good but prices seem to increase too often.
awful. unless you like it when the stylist completely ignores what you ask for and does whatever they want. got the mvp. shirt was soaking wet afterwards.
good hair cut - a little disappointed that you don't get greeted when you come through the door.  ths staff is not overly friendly.  parking is not easy but there is an underground lot if you want to walk.
worst service ever! will never go there again treated my child poorly just cause she didn't wanna be patient with him but when i told her that she is rushing she got upset and said i cannot do this. told me to contact her manager at another location which i did they were able to finish my child's haircut and show him great customer service.
"not sure why this isn't ranked higher. granted i went in there during a workday morning, but it was a great experience overall. friendly, efficient, and an attentive haircut. they've recently incorporated new technology that makes the checkin process a breeze."
"sports clips, the franchise chain? for haircuts? heck yes!i've been coming here for the last 2-3 years for a couple of reasons. first, it's very inexpensive for a guy's haircut in this neighborhood. second, the staff is very consistent with many stylists who have been around for years. third, i can walk her from my house.after getting about 50 haircuts here, i've only had 2 negative experiences from a newbie stylist who missed a spot or wasn't friendly. overwhelmingly, i've had a good experience. for $21 plus tip, you can't really beat the short wait for a good haircut. plus, no need for an appointment and you can always call ahead!"
"went back to see a stylist that has been taking care of me for some time and found out that she was no longer there. the last time that i was there i wonder where all of the usual faces were. most of the girls that used to be there are no longer there because some,cheap ass owner issues. guy didn't want to pay them their bonuses so everyone left. i wasn't worried about the girl that cuts my hair she has a full time and was only there as a hobby, but she was really good. i called to get a haircut and they said that she was no longer there. this place sucks without the usual gang of girls. stay away! its not worth it. aside from that, the new crew can't even cut. it smells like they hired a gang of chain smokers."
"the ladies here are really good about what you are looking for in a haircut. i've never had a bad experience yet, and it's been about a year... that's really good for salon."
"great place to get your hair cut! i've been going to this place for years, they get you in and out very fast! i highly recommend yajaira!"
"came in to cut my hair on a monday at 2pm. place was not busy, no one was waiting. i did not get greeted when i walked in. sat down for 15 minutes and after that i went to one of the ladies and asked her if she could give me a guess on how long it could be, with a response of everyone is on break so ido how long. i waited another 10 minutes then left."
"i love getting my haircut at this location, services is quick and prices are reasonable. the girls known what they are doing - they're awesome at giving new ideas on haircuts if you're looking to try something new. the selection on hair products are also a plus since they're always rolling out with new products to choose from. it's honestly become my new go to spot!"
"so...my boyfriend...a very sweet and quiet guy...went in for a haircut at 6:30 on friday night.he came home looking like an idiot with an inch and a half bald strip and blunt, unfaded, crooked line above his hairline.  he says that they asked him twice if he wanted ""square or natural"" to which he replied both times ""natural"".adding insult to injury, when he paid at the end and asked for change for a $20 in the form of three $5's and five $1's, he was told that they only had $5's and was therefore forced to leave a 25% tip on a bad haircut.i should add that this is just days before our whole family arrives for thanksgiving! so, i took a picture of the back of his head and went in to get his money back.i was nice. i was laughing.  i showed them the picture and explained the specifics.the manager informed me that they do not give refunds........not the right answer.  i suggested that they should in this case.she said she wouldn't.i said ""you need to figure something out then""she said she would call the owner if i would wait.the owner said no refund.i said ""look, i am a business owner too and that is the wrong decision.  $20 is not worth a bad review and having me spread the word  to my 4000 clients that you are incompetent and unreasonable.""she went into the closet and dug up two $5 off coupons.ha.  like we would go back to use them.sigh. i approached it in a friendly manner, i was right, i had proof, i was not being unfair or asking for anything extra.  the right thing to do would have been to apologize, ask for a second chance in the future, give me my $20 and sent me on my way satisfied and content. alas, t'was not the case.tsk tsk tsk"
i waited half an hour and a stylist just took a guy that walked in not 2 minutes ago. i've spent too much money here to waste my time sitting in a chair being ignored. might help to look at the list that my name was on. the one all the stylists saw me sign. don't put your friends ahead of paying customers. that's how you lose them. bye sport clips! i've got plenty of money to spend somewhere else.
"sweet jesus is this place ever bad. i asked for a simple haircut, leave it long on top, use a #2 guard below the curve on the back of my head and fade it in. what did i end up with? a bert and ernie haircut like half the cholos have, shaved all the way around from the top of my head to my neck. on closer inspection, the part on the top that was long has a hunk missing out of it near the back right hand side. never going back, and i would advise anyone who values their appearance to stay far away."
"they are always friendly and consistently do a good job. what more do you need?  how about having your sixth haircut half price? keep their stamp card and this too can soon be yours. sports and espn are on the tvs while you wait and get your hair cut, which is nice."
"went in wanting the basic cheapest haircut, my hair is simple so i don't need to do a lot to it. i've been to other sport clips and had great experiences but this one for some reason only offers the 2 more expensive options. it was an ok haircut but if i wanted to spend a minimum of $20 on a haircut i wouldn't go to a chain."
"service is always quick and reasonably priced. very convenient location as well. the hair cut itself is excellent as well. plus you get to catch up on sportscenter allowing you to kill two birds with one stone...proverbially speaking of course. allow a hunting theme might be interesting come to think of it. all in all, a great place to get a quick, quality cut at a fair price."
i have had some ridiculously expensive haircuts and i have been to places where they do mani/pedis and hair but this place rocked today. sandra gave me one of the best haircuts i've ever had i am going to be a regular here in the heights
"sign says they close at 8 but they close at 7:45, even asked if they could cut but said sorry we close in 10 minutes. sport clips have been going down the drain"
"i always get treated well here. they hold great conversations and, if you can beat their busy peaktimes, they work pretty fast. the icing on the cake is getting a rinse after. sometimes i wish it as longer so i can fall asleep."
"after being long over due for a haircut, sandra did an amazing job and quickly done as well. she was very sweet and spoiled me with the mvp treatment. this will be my go to place in houston area now for my haircut."
"awesome customer service , zero wait time and angela was awesome with her speed, control and styling ! thank you angela"
"my boyfriend and i love coming here for his haircuts. roxanne is the absolute best!! great atmosphere, clean floors and surfaces, good decor and entertainment. we came here once just to find somewhere nearby for a spontaneous haircut for him and haven't gone anywhere since. when you go, definitely ask for roxanne! she's nice, friendly, knowledgeable, and excellent at what she does."
"as any other person trying a new hair salon, i was a bit nervous and reluctant coming into sport clips. as soon as i stepped inside, i was greeted by one of the stylists there and asked to sign in. this location was very clean and smelled great. all the staff were friendly, and from what i was able to see, great with their customers (especially kids). destiny took care of me and she was great; she really took the time to make sure the look i wanted came out the way i desired and gave me tips for the future. the stylists here are not just there to cut hair, rather they establish a friendly and personal relationship with the client all the while keeping professionalism. i was very happy with my visit and my new look and will definitely be back! i highly recommend 10/10"
jennifer hooked it up with a job-landing haircut! i went in looking like a bum and i told her i needed something professional to help me in my search for a job. she knew exactly what to do and i couldn't be more pleased with what she did. the shop was very clean and neat. i liked the new sign-in feature where you can also request your stylist and see the expected wait time on a screen in the waiting lobby.
15 min. till closing and the 1st chair to the right said sorry we are closed. i asked hee if she could please cut my son's hair we are not from the area and we were close by. she said yeah well it's sunday said fine! il cut his hair. she was slamming the comb the siccors and proceeded to cut my son's hair like she realy didn't want to she said outload how she had some where to be how she needed to still do payroll and how she should of made sure the door was locked.  it was unpleasant 1st sport clips experience. we will never go there again.
went in for my second haircut at this location. i first thought that the lady was a little rash in shaving half my head to show me how short the buzzer clip went. i told the lady what i wanted. she then proceeded to style it in a style that was the opposite of what i asked for. it doesn't look awful but it does not look great either. all that needed to be done was a trim and a little shortening. nothing more. never coming back here again.
as always. a great haircut from denise. she makes you welcome and always has a smile on her face. denise is a valuable asset to the company. you rock denise.  plus i love the way she takes her time when cutting my hair.  so keep rocking denise!!  ken
the lady with the tshirt #93 just gave my 4 year old a hard time for getting a lollipop...rude and unnecessary.
"my husband just got a haircut at this place. little did he know that the woman was going to give him an unrequested new style. he didn't even notice the mistake until i saw it. time to switch to a new barbershop. if you are not an adventurer when it comes to new hair styles, i wouldn't recommend that you go to this place. i have been trying to upload the picture but it's not showing."
great location. nice staff. i moved to the heights in june and this location is the best i've been to i. houston and dallas!i've had my hair cut by denise 2x and she's been great! if there is a wait they will give you an honest estimate so you can leave and come back.
moved to the heights from montrose so needed a new barber.  have been here 3 times and they have always done a great job.  usually never have to wait more than 5 minutes.  highly recommended !!!
"seats are comfy, great service, place looks great! jj watt on the back wall! big screens everywhere!"
2nd time at this location and still love it. i will continue to come back. stylists are friendly and skilled and the atmosphere is fun.
awesome place to get a haircut! will definitely be going back. the service is worth a great tip!
i wanted the stylist to trim the sides and not cut into the top since i wanted to grow out a top knot....and what does she do...she cuts into the top...ridiculous
"great place to get a haircut for your child! i've been brining my son to denise for over 4 years and she has never disappointed! he changes his style every few months and denise hears him out and always executes the haircut to perfection! thank you, denise!!"
"came in at 2:30 on a friday afternoon. 2 ladies at work.  signed in right behind another guy.  quickly followed by 5 others.   none of the typical ""hi we will be right with you!!!""  fake happiness you get at the other stores. 10 minutes in one lady at last returned from lunch and got me right ini'm here in this location due to changing of my office location. i'm part of the fancy pants birthday club which means that i should get the mvp today free.  what, what!!!  ha.  about 15 minutes of wait jacqueline came out and got me and proceeded to give me one of the better haircuts i've had.  she threw some nongreasy man product in my hair and off i went!"
"extremely disappointed. made a yelp account so i could leave this review. ive come to this location before and each time i have gotten a haircut similar to what i ask for. but this time i was completely ignored. i booked mei because i had a decent haircut by her last time a few months ago. she recognized me so when i sat down my first words were ""i'm cutting my hair differently."" and proceeded to show a picture and explained the haircut i desired. multiple times i said i want the sides faded longer with a 2 with the shortest point being at .5-1 at the bottom. then on the top i asked for some length and a different style entirely. i asked her to cut my hair in a forwards fringe motion and showed several pictures showing this. she shaved a .5 entirely on my sides with a tiny bit of fade at the top fading into maybe a 1. not even. then only asked my opinion after it was too late. i have an undercut quiff basically and just cut my hair into the same as last time. there is no length in  the front whatsoever resembling any type of fringe. there is no style to it and no fade into the sides whatever. i asked for it to be connected and its completely disconnected. when going to style my hair she proceeds to style it in an upwards motion with a massive amount of gel which i would have opted out for if given the option. i jerked my head away realizing its too late and she has cut my hair too short to do any sort of style i asked for. i then stated this is not what i asked for. i asked for this to be cut forwards. not upwards. i wanted length in the front. i do not style my hair upwards ever.  and she laughed and said it looks good. which i then had to take over and try to salvage some style to the mess of a haircut i received. she rushed through my haircut. my sideburns arent even or straight for the matter. had she listened and not rushed through and thought she knew what i wanted maybe she could of provided a decent haircut but that was not the case. it would be one thing if i didnt say anything either but i did. she just  laughed it off. um no. i'm telling you this isn't right?  or if i gave unclear instructions. but i showed several face on pictures and to the side pictures resembling a modern fringe. in fact. this is the pciture i showed the most. and the picture i asked the sides to fade like. i will not be returning. i very very dissatisfied."
"sport clips is a safe haven for a haircut and a little more. if you like sports with your haircut this is your place.  if you are like me and just want to walk out with a haircut that doesn't make you look worse, this is also your place. i cannot speak to the more exotic looks or challenges. i love the people here. they seem to have fun and a light amount of drama that makes your haircut experience close as you will get to being on reality tv."
"my wife was given a coupon for a free haircut from tompkins high school where she works. she took my son to the sports  clips in cinco ranch and when it was time to pay she presented the coupon and was told that it was for another location not this one. i was not there but from what my wife told me they were not understanding at all or flexible and never apologized, to the point she felt as she was being talked down to. maybe being hispanic and english being her second language that they felt that they can talk and treat someone as they did.it is not the $ it is how it was handled and how she was spoken to."
"cheston and his team have done a great job with this store. i've been going here for years and have used a few select stylists for my hair. they are always friendly, professional, they listen to your preferences and walk away with a consistent haircut. i've been with jacki now for over a year and she's excellent. keep up the good work! -mark"
"glenda did an amazing job with my cut.  i wanted something different and she did a hard-part, turned out awesome, i love it!!!  thanks glenda!  the owner is fantastic as well - i enjoy spending my money where it's locally owned and they are great at what they do.  thank you!"
five stars!!!i've been getting my hair cut here for over two years. the service here is great and the people that work at this location have always been friendly and accommodating. if you need a haircut then you definitely want to come checkout this sport clips in cinco. my favorite stylist is tonya r. she always does an excellent job on my hair and is truly an awesome person.
this place is great! tonya knows how to treat a customer!  i have had my hair cut by several of the ladies there and it is always done right!the place is always clean and sports are on t.v.s everywhere!  i am always in and out quickly and never have to explain what i want done!  somehow they know!i won't go anywhere else!
"i went in for my normal haircut and they absolutely butchered my hair. they cut a massive patch out of the top and tried to cover it up with gel. after i noticed it, i went back and they made it even worse in an attempt to fix it. never going back again. worst experience i've ever had."
will not be going back to this location.  were three stylists working when i arrived and two people in front of me so figured the wait would be 15-20 minutes.  45 minutes later the third stylist hasn't cut anyone's hair and is chit chatting with who i am guessing is an area manager.  one of the other customers is frustrated because he is having to get a second hair cut because his stylist didn't use the correct length on the clippers.  walked out after 45 minutes because it was going to be at least another 16-20 before they got to me.
"nice place for a guy to get a haircut without feeling a little awkward in a salon. they had a sports theme going here as they had tvs showing espn and other sports stuff while you wait for your turn. the lady who cut my hair did a good job on the fade i asked her to cut (i always tell them to do it a certain way that i like). i had to pay a little more but if it means my hair doesn't look like i cut it on my own, i'll pay extra."
my husband uses this location for his haircuts. he says it is a good store and really recommends liz. she's a good stylist and is very friendly. she listens to what you want done and executes well.
always a good hair cut. ladies always polite. have been to other salons who don't have enough hairstylists. this location has plenty and the wait is generally short.
this is our go to spot for our 8 year old's haircuts.  they do a great job every time!
we love this place! all the girls are great. jackie is my normal stylist. and now my one year old is a customer of xenia. we appreciate they try to keep the wait time short. i recommend getting the mvp. there's nothing like a little pampering.
i love tanya and have been going to her for a while. she gives a great cut but also makes me feel like im coming back to a great hango it place. great chick.
great haircut! the mvp treatment highly recommended!! doris is the best!!! tv's with espn going every where you turn!
"always a friendly staff, they will remember your face and take care of anything you need. they've offered me to come between haircuts to trim the back of the neck and touch up until it's time for my next haircut. shampoo comes with a great face and neck massage, hot towel as well! remember, tip your stylist!!!"
"my husband and daughter came here today to get their hair cut by stephanie.  she is by far the best stylist we have been to.  we have followed her around from shop to shop and she is now here.  i really like the way she cuts his hair, and she used to cut my daughters hair at sugar and spice prior to them closing.  the place is clean, and you can tell that they put a lot of effort in making sure it looks nice, not a lot of hair on the ground and cleaning all the tools after they use them.  we will definitely be back here!"
first time was wonderful as i lost last stylist after 20 years. yvonne cut my hair differently and i loved the look. will definitely be back.
had a good experience! thanks for the great haircut! i recommend getting a wash because it doubles as a head mass
"like this place. affordable, quick, no bs. dont forget to take the 10% by checking in on yelp :)"
"good value for money. the stylist rotate through the store quite regularly, so hard to get same one consistently."
"decent is the best word to describe it. the price to quality ratio. the customer service. just decent. paid about $23 after yelp discount and tip. just the haircut, no extras. i used to go to men's hair salon on fondren in sharpstown, but now it's too far after i moved. $7 + $3 tip. comparable if not better."
"jianely got me here- chelli and priscilla keep me returning, as do the rest!some other locations have stylists who assume they know how to best help you and either don't ask or don't listen to what your head needs.here, i always feel that i am in good hands and can relax without being forced to chat or having comments ignored. the stylists really focus on each customer.thanks!!"
very good place lexx always cuts my hair on point each and every time.. get the vip treatment it's very relaxing i recommend all my family and friends to come here ..
"rachel takes such amazing care of me every time i'm here! i never have to tell her what i want, it's like she just knows. she does such a great jo and is fun to talk with the entire time she is cutting my hair. the rest of the staff is really good as well, they take great care of me if rachel isn't there."
"since day one i been coming here the manager (rachel) has been cutting my hair. i love the way she does my high and tight fade and a amazing scalp massage. the staff is nice and approachable but rachel is my hairstylist, i can't cheat on her :)"
"great service,  fast and friendly service. no wait.  great cut xxxxxxxxxx'h&hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
natasha is very professional and not pushy with any products or services. i was happy with the haircut too. i would recommend her to anyone!
"got a great cut by rachael, fast service, friendly staff and off course sports on tvs"
"still working all the problems out of a new store but i'm sure they will do fine. good stylist, very clean, very nice tv set up for patrons. sure i will be back"
lexx did an awesome job cutting my hair. knew exactly what i needed and was extremely friendly! 5 star haircut all the way!ryan
"the first time i went there it was great! the lady was awesome!!the second time i came back because i was told free cleanups and she asked me how i'd like it done, and i asked if she could cut the top as well as part of the clean up. she charged me the full $20 for the haircut when i thought i was just getting a cleanup for free! chelly was her name and was just not as nice like the other lady i had the first time... she was just not sympathetic that $20 is a lot of money for some people."
"nice staff, but the lady cutting my hair took off way too much on the top making me look shorter and fatter than i really am.  paying more attention to the customers request needs to be of more importance.  details, details, details people!"
natasha the assistant manager is awesome. my 5 year old son loves to get a haircut here.
"great service, no wait. they remember your name and how you like your hair cut. very clean and new store with large tvs playing sports. just as advertised! megan is a great stylist!!"
hi i know i left a bad review earlier but i want back and they are really good  here as good as it gets i love the service the second time back im now going to be coming here every time for my haircut
staff and management are very friendly and professional! very clean venue. there was no wait and i was in and out in about 30 min. i would highly recommend this place!
"great haircut!  very fast and efficient. i was in and out in no time. the staff was very friendly and helpful. the place is brand new,  it is very clean and nice. there is lots of seating. parking was also very easy."
"i've been going to this specific location for awhile now, i would say i am usually satisfied with the haircuts i get here. however i was there on sunday and got a haircut from an employee i had never seen before. at the time i left it seemed fine because she had styled my hair with hair product. but later that night when i got home and showered, my hair was very uneven on all sides. i returned today however and i must say mariandre surpassed my expectations and completely fixed my hair! she is a huge life saver, i had an important job interview coming up at the end of the week. for first timers, i definitely recommend her, she definitely knows what she's doing! if you're not able to get her because they're usually busy at this location, at least ask for her recommendation!!"
"if zero stars were an options, that's what i would choose. i took my boys to sports clips of copperfield on tuesday morning for haircuts. they have since not left the house except for a quick library trip on wednesday. it was discovered this morning (friday) that both boys have lice. my youngest son's poor head is covered with bugs, nits, and scabs. i have spent nearly $75 on treating all the kids, myself, and our home so far. (there very well could be more). we have had to miss an entire day of schoolwork (i homeschool year-round). we also have a party for my oldest's baseball team winning the league championship tonight that we may now have to miss and my husband and i have (expensive) tickets to a concert tomorrow night that we may also have to miss due to not having childcare with lice in our home. not to mention that i'm pregnant with twins and am having a hard time being on my feet for more than 30min at a time and i'm left with trying to wash all the bedding and pillows and stuffed animals and treating the carpet and furniture. i told all of this to the lady who answered the phone when i called the salon this morning (who also happened to be the one who cut both boys' hair) and all they offered was to give us their next haircuts for free. i am so angry and disgusted. not just at their obvious lack of sanitary conditions in their salon, but at their unwillingness to do anything to make this right for my family. we will not be setting foot into a sports clips again and i hope my friends both in houston and around the country will reconsider using their services as well."
came in this morning and was greeted and almost immediately taken to a chair. marii did a great job cutting my hair. stronger hands for a shampoo would be my only issue but she was awesome.
this was my first time with my boys and they were super fast. i thought for a saturday they would be packed but it wasn't. tiffany cut my sons hair exactly how i asked and it was perfect. i will be coming here from now on.
"the worse service i have encountered, assistant manager arguing with me i thought she was going to hit me. she made my son cry and never apologize to him. i have always taken my kids to the cinco ranch location and they're too sweet. wow seeing my son cry the way he was broke my heart."
"i came in with a free haircut coupon. it covered any haircut,but because my hair hair is too thick i'd have to pay an extra $10."
if i could give it a zero i would my son was excited to come here for the first time showed up at 320 checked in the wait time said 30 minutes they skipped my sons name about four times when asked they said give us five minutes meanwhile they are trying to figure out who will cut his hair out of the six girls there nobody could figure it out  ended up getting on the chair until 450 everyone kept coming  in and out and we were still waiting!!!never coming back again!!! other then that the girl who cut his hair did a good job just bad management the other idiots looked clueless
"ask for jenny t. this is a great place, they're nice, clean, and professional. waiting time is good and service is great."
"this is my go to spot to get my hair cut.  everyone there is friendly, professional, and does a great job.  the service is always quick and if there is ever a wait there's always a game on the tv or plenty of shopping nearby to kill the time. i'm looking forward to going back in a few weeks."
no complaints here. they always do a nicejob of making what little hair i have left lookgood. about 4000 tvs hanging on the walls makesit almost impossible to miss a play or a lap.
"i love this location.  they are always very nice, clean, and very quick.  the people who cut your hair are quick and very cordial and helpful.  plus, if you're a guy how can you go wrong with sports on every tv?  i always appreciate a good haircut, cleanliness, and great service!"
"over all experience was horriable. stylist concerned about other conversations with other stylist. not paying attention to customers hair. my hair is crooked and parts just skipped over. 22 dollar lesson learned passed the hair wash i was pissed. to bad i use to come here all the time. went down the parking lot to get fixed seems i'm not, first customer with same issue."
came in to get my haircut fixed from a day before from the men's salon the boardroom in the heights where i spent $50 and got a terrible cut. i entered sports clips because i needed my poor haircut fixed asap. i was skeptical to come here from some bad experiences long long ago but needed it done. alma fixed my cut and they only charged me $10 as it was not the full deal so i was happy with that. she did a great job and my hair is back to looking good. definitely made up for past experiences and the staff were great. thanks!
"i went to sport clips in march and meant to write this earlier but oh well. i went solely because their online menu said women's haircut was $16. i was going to get a trim so i thought the price was fair. i went in and waited approximately 30-40 minutes and then got a chair and was proceeded to be told that the $16 hair cut for women was not available, i think they thought i was lying to them and they told me to show them the website prices, i went ahead and pulled it up. they ended up telling me i could get a hair cut for the $16 price but it would be a straight cut and not a trimming of my already present layers. i take very good care of my hair and i know that a straight cut damages my hair-- but as a college student you take what you can get, so i went and got it anyways. it looked cute for the first day, though after the natural volume in my hair was gone and a week later already had split ends. i won't be returning because of the way i was treated (like i was lying to get a better deal) when i had never been to sport clips before and i won't be recommending this place."
got a great hair cut and felt very happy with the experience.i was highly impressed by the service that included a shampoo as most times after a haircut i am left uncomfortable with short hair clippings on my neck and shoulders.
waited here for more than 30 minutes to have my sons called just because the girl monitoring the front desk is not following procedure for logging clients in. how difficult is that?! 3 other clients that came in after us were called before my sons.  lousy service!!!!!!  when i brought it to her attention she asked a stylist that wasn't even monitoring the front desk who came in first. pay attention girl!  your job is not difficult!this was not our first time here. we have been here about 5 times since we moved to the area.
"went in last week and was told there would be a 25 min wait.  ok, no problem. 45 min later someone else walks in and gets their haircut before my son.  i'm thinking, ok maybe they requested the stylist. an hour goes by, and a man who came in and had only waited about 15 minutes gets called for a haircut. such a disappointment...and after seeing some other reviews, it looks like we are not the only ones to have experienced this."
"this was our first experience here and we were very impressed. melissa and tammy are upbeat, friendly, professional, and talented hair stylists that understood exactly how we wanted our haircut. the prices are good, $17 for me and $14 for my daughter. megan at the front desk has a great attitude and is very professional. we will be back, thanks ladies!"
"worth the wait . whet on sunday around 12. very busy, but very professional staff. great hair cut plus shampoo for only 17 dollars .."
"my husband and our boys have been going here for 1.5 years.  our boys won't be back with me again after they estimated a 10 minute wait and i waited with a 2yo for over 30mn.  when i looked at the service area, all the stylists were gone... it was like with a waiting room full of people, they took a collective lunch break.  my son and i left, and i called later to see if we'd ever actually made the list (we signed in on paper instead of talking to someone so i didn't know if maybe we'd never made it into the computer) and the lady was super mean.  cheap hair cut isn't worth crap service, i'll just start taking my boys to the salon i go to."
great cut. prompt service. reasonable price. close to grocery store as well. very easy service
great location with a nice waiting area and quick service. check in online to skip the wait. great haircut from lucinda!
i highly recommend paula. i come here every 3 weeks or so. always happy!!  the price is right and the service is great.
"i guess you could say i'm sportclips newest stylist, so come see me, my name is haylee!!"
always happy getting my hair cut here. friendly staff. the new check in system is quick and easy. i rarely have to wait more than 5-10 minutes. thanks!
eloina is excellent everytime. always professional. good clean surroundings. i wish i could post a short review on yel. great job glad to be here
great experience at sport clips! short wait time and excellent service! i will definitely be coming back!
paula was incredible and i am definitely coming back to this location! i've been a long time sport clips fan and now i am definitely going to come back to this location to see paula again.i highly recommend this sport clips location.the atmosphere is friendly and accommodating. definitely come check them out!
"paula,  you are the best stylist ever. best sports clips in town , fast friendly and professional"
"my friend and i came here after another location rudely refused to take us even though we walked in well before they closed. i was relieved to find that the employees here were very courteous and my stylist was very friendly and comfortably conversational. i was happy with my haircut also. the only thing was my friend and i anticipated the haircut to be $16 based on past experience and it ended up being $22, but perhaps prices differ by location."
"friendly staff, excellent service, little wait time. great for kids. would definitely return."
i always get a good haircut from this location. everyone is very friendly and helpful. they are good at recommending hair cair products as well. there are always discounts available as well. i have been going there for many years and would recommend them to everyone.
"speedy service, great haircut, short amount of time. highly recommended! lucy did great job and ensured what i requested was what i wanted. was surprised how quickly she was able to do what i wanted."
time for another awesomely fab cut! always great service from these ladies! make it a point to stop at this location.. they are awesome
"i was a patron of the sports clips on shepherd due to one stylist paula. they asked her to leave, which was a huge mistake. i found her at this location. even though it is 20 mins away from my home. i will continue to use this location so i may use paula as my sole stylist."
paula is fantastic!  i felt like she really cared about my hair.  wonderful experience!!
"the check in process at sports clips of west university is quick and easy. the facility is clean and welcoming. eloina did a great job, and i will definitely be asking for her again. i would definitely recommend this sports clips to a friend!"
"this is my third time coming here. i went to a different one for a while cuz i did not had to have the best experience the first time. however, i saw that their ratings had improved. i'm glad i did is this is closer to my house. i had a good experience this time. i think they change out a lot of staff and it's better than it used to be."
excellent check-in system. nice waiting area with plenty of sports on tv. jas special offers for yelp check-in and reviews.
"did not cut my hair properly, highly unsatisfied. do not recommend for 1st time visitors: this was my 1st experience at sports clips ever on friday 12/8 from 5:30-6:30pm. i chose this location because it's proximity to my job. i appreciated the smoothness of being of to check-in and immediately getting a cut but that was it.my barber (whose name i don't know she said it too fast and i don't remember seeing a name tag) was nice and we had a good conversation initially but she misunderstood my request. i asked for a #1.. tapper fade and that was not what i got. she cut my hair too low and she f**ked up my edge up (she was trying to say a tapper fade means i wanted to be bald.. if i wanted to be bald i would've asked for that) i was not satisfied at all.she made me feel shitty because there was a couple times in where she almost cut me with the clippers and gave me unsolicited advice about moisturizing my facial hair and shampooing my hair.. i'm a grown man (25)... i think i know how to take care of myself.. so don't' blame me because you're not doing a good job. one piece of unsolicited advice was to ""use hand sanitizer"" to get rid of razor bumps...okay.and then she shampoo and washed my hair and it was extremely uncomfortable. from the seat setup (i felt that i was too tall and my neck hurt while it was going on), hot rag on my face, to the ""massage"" of a my scalp, to the fact that i had no idea wtf a mvp package was.. it was awkward and uncomfortable and i only allowed it to happen because it was already a horrible experience and she knew it. at the end she attempted to charge me $30, which i was going to pay but then she acted like something was wrong with the machine and took off the $30 and charge me $10 because she knew i was not satisfied..she even said ""i only charge you 10 because you did not like it"". while i was in the chair, she even tried to say oh ""so and so cut your hair hear before"".. i was like no.. i've never been here before or to a sports clips ever. as of right now based on my experience, this is not a place i would recommend to a 1st timer whose never been to your establishment and i do not plan to return."
"haircut worked wait, no wait time on saturday morning.the stylist was very professional and made sure we understand each other about the length of the haircut."
"i have been coming to this location for many years and i've put up with the very expensive haircuts and the very little attention placed to detail as evidenced by the haircuts that last less than 10 minutes with nothing but clippers. i even let go of the lesson taught to me long ago that good haircuts happen when the stylist uses scissors because they take their time and pay closer attention.  i did this because this location is close to my home.  after my experience earlier this week, no more.  this location needs to be taken over by someone competent.  i went in on the 11th of june at about 7:35 pm.  the haircut lasted less than 10 minutes and i thought it odd that the lady who cut my hair didn't hold up a mirror behind my head and ask me what i thought of the cut. i've been coming to this location for years and this was the first time i wasn't asked.  it was almost closing time and i thought it was no big deal.  when i got home to shower, i looked in the mirror and noticed that she left a big gash where she wasn't paying attention with the clippers right by my ear.  i ended up having to shave my head entirely because the gash she left was already a zero and i'm not going to walk around like i'm a 5 year old who used a pair of clippers for the first time.  what upset me about this was not so much that she made a mistake; but that she lacked the character to come clean about it.  there is no way she could stand behind me, finish the hair cut, use the blow dryer to clean me off without seeing her work.  if she had said to me right then and there, ""hey, i'm sorry, i made a mistake,"" this would be a very different story, but she didn't do that.  she chose to send me on my way.  i paid 27 dollars for this.  it is not okay. it gets worse.  the next day, i walk into the same location and asked to speak with a manager or supervisor or owner.  the person who was there said, ""we don't really have managers."" how is it that an establishment with brand recognition that sports clips has, doesn't have managers?  that's ludicrous.  she went on to explain that there was a person, ""stephanie"" who had been there a really long time and that she wasn't there until 4:30 pm.  i explained the situation to her about what happened and even showed her pictures.  she went over to another lady who was cutting hair and talked to her.  i was told by both ladies that i'd have to return at 4:30pm to see what could be done.  this was unacceptable to me.  any legitimate business should be able to give a 27 dollar refund without inconveniencing the client.  i raised my voice and explained to them that their response was not acceptable and that i needed a phone number to speak with someone immediately.  only after insisting several times, did they magically produce a phone number for this ""stephanie.""  why is it that a customer needs to raise their voice and insist on a solution before employees finally try and be helpful?  there is a much better way to do business.  when i spoke to stephanie i explained the situation to her and she went on to say that giving refunds was not their typical way of handling these types of matters, that instead what they did was ""comp"" future haircuts for the client.  so the solution you guys offer is to give free haircuts to a client after ruining a hair cut?  i am to trust the same people who messed up in the first place?  i explained that i wasn't comfortable with that and repeated the consequences of the bad job they did.  she responded by being snippy and tell me that it was my choice to shave my head.  since she was rude, i was rude too and very quickly let her know that i'm not going to walk around looking like a fool because of something they did.  i raised my voice and let her know that i needed my money back and that i didn't want to return for any free haircuts.  she finally let me know that she was going to have to call some regional office to get an okay to provide a refund for me.  how is it that giving a refund needs to be approved by some regional office?  that is absolutely unacceptable and unprofessional.  you think i'm going to trust you guys or let alone recommend you? she called me back shortly to let me know that my refund was going to be given and that she was very sorry that this happened.  she went on to explain that to show their apologies that i'd get vouchers for future haircuts.  i let her know that it would be a really long time before i thought of setting foot at their location again.  in summary: 1.  train your employees that when something goes wrong, have the character to accept it.  i suggest training in which you role play with your employees and practice these scenarios so that if they do arise, employees are prepared for it.   trust is easy to loose and hard to gain. 2.  when a refund is necessary, don't inconvenience the same client whom you've already screwed over.  when my haircut was done, i was told the cost and i paid immediately.  i didn't respond by"
great place for a haircut! they are quick .love the service ! this is my favorite sport clips!ask for victoria! she rocks!
great service ! coming back here again victoria seemed she knew what she was doing. less than 2 minutes wait. just excellent !
my 7 yr old son had a scissor cut.  the stylist asked what i wanted.  she  was fast and his hair looks good.  satisfied!!
"great location. new technology to check in lets you know when you are up. on this particular trip, there was no wait. the haircut is for my son, age 9. the hairdresser made good conversation with him and listened to what he wanted. nice clean place. friendly staff. can't beat that!"
"great place. nice environment. no waiting time. would definitely come back.price is ok, 22 for the haircut and 8 for the beard.very satisfied"
great haircut! lorena was the best! i'll always come back. can't get enough of these sports haircuts!
"great place for a toodler haircut! my kid was so quiet while the hairstylist was cutting his hair. additionally, the place is always nice and clean!"
great haircut!  ariel is awesome!  i'll definitely be back!  she cleaned up my beard. my wife noticed that she cleaned me up!
"sonia was great, great haircut and great job. i hardly had to wait. atmosphere was good. i'll come back!!"
"i'm a long-time sport clips client, but this was my first time at this location and it was so far below standards. for starters, i've done plenty of retail / service jobs so i can recognize the little things that are supposed to seem natural but are all ""by the book."" upon signing me in, she did not introduce herself by name, offer a handshake or ask about an mvp. 0/3 for the intro routine!i then explained what i wanted, which included explaining where i part my hair, how i part my hair, where it gets spiky when its get too short. i said i wanted it long enough to part and to comb, and ended by saying ""i have to be able to do more with it than just spiking it."" apparently all she heard was ""spiking it."" not even 10 conversation-free (no in-progress questions about the cut, no banter) minutes later my hair is shorter than it's been since i was in the military. why would i explain all about the part and the styling if i wanted brospike?  this location is really convenient for me, and there are obviously plenty of stylists there so i will likely go back. but (a) if you're management train your staff in the customer experience, to include listening (!!!!), and (b) if you're a customer be specific. be very specific, and have them repeat it back to you before anything starts."
great service. it did't take anytime to get me into haircut. sennai is great! clean place. highly recommend it.
stephanie was amazing!! super fast and friendly service! the stylist even helped me trim my new beard!i had super long shaggy hair and it was constantly getting in my eyes. i actually did my first hair flip in over five years and right then i knew i needed a hair cut. i walked in to the place with at least five people in front of me and i still didn't wait longer than ten minutes. she gave me amazing tips on how to take care of my beard since my girlfriend won't let me shave it.
"friendly staff, convenient location and great haircut! i came in during my lunch break on a tuesday and didn't have to wait at all. their new digit kiosk system logs your information making checking in and out easier. they log your last haircut information in so if your looking for the same cut they will have it on file! streamlined affordable great haircuts here!"
stephanie was great. got a great haircut and beard trim. got the mvp which is always a treat. was not disappointed at all.
"sonia was great! there was no wait, great conversation, and she did a perfect job on the haircut. will continue to come back every month :)"
great job by stephanie. looks awesome and she was very nice. i would definitely come back to see her. it's nice place too with sports on tv.
quick excellent service. was able to get in the monday before a holiday. attentive service and great results.
speedy service & very clean.my son's haircut came out great! thanks again sports clips! he loves it!
"love this place! friendly staff, super clean and always fun! plus they've got sports on tv. what's not to love??"
i started coming to this specific sports clips because of consuelo. she is awesome and so sweet. she is my go to barber because she cuts my hair the way i like.
"take my 7 yo here.  great haircuts, great price, no appt needed!  never have to wait more than a few minutes!"
nice place with a great staff. iris gave me a great hair cut. very pleased. would definitely go back.
well run location and they make sure to get your haircut right. i even asked for a little more length off after a full cut and she didn't get frustrated or mad and spent the extra time to make sure i was happy with the results.
i've always received a good haircut and good service at this location. i check in online and live about 15 minutes away so i never have to wait long.
great service and quick. it's always hard to find a spot that gives you a consistent cut while avoiding the hassles of having a dedicated stylist. most every time i go i have a different person but always leave fairly pleased with the results. quan did a great job this time around and look forward to heading back.
3 days after my haircut there is still a red line on my neck.  i think quan tried to take off my head. clippers should not be used to as a stabbing device on the neck.  i don't know why barbers still do this.  it shows lack of skill in making an even cut using clippers the normal way.
"great experience, quan my lovely stylish cut my hair well and was full of great information. i liked the  new sign in system. keep up the good work."
always a great experience at this location; the wait usually isn't too bad and the quality is excellent. i'm the type of perfectionist that goes home and has to clean-up/fix the haircut if it's not right; i've never had that issue here.
"to be perfectly blunt, many times when i get a haircut these days, i'm looking for a place that 1) gives me good value, 2) is quick and 3) i don't have to talk much about what's going on in my life, etc. that may make me sound like an old curmudgeon, but if that sounds like a place you'd like top get a haircut, then sports clips sawyer heights is your place. there are places you can spend two or three times as much for a top quality haircut. maybe you'll be content doing that. but this place is very good value for money."
we love this location. the staff is so friendly and attentive. i have a 4 year old and he loves getting his hair cut by consuelo. she is so patient with him and so sweet. we will keep coming here.
"great place, great environment with fun, kind, efficient, and professional associates!  in recently relocating to houston, finding a barber that was pleasant, and keeps up with the most current trends was difficult until i found consuelo at sports clips on taylor (sawyer heights).  she has been a complete gem, and making sure that my hair is cut just right to lend itself to versatile styles - from a business look to trendy style that draws positive attention!"
great people! love getting my haircut here.  diana takes care of me. been coming here for 2 years.
"the only place i get a haircut at. the staff is really friendly, and i've never been disappointed. i recommend mayra all the time. i wouldn't let anyone else touch my hair! waiting time isn't too long most of the time. came in on a monday at 6pm and no one was waiting before me.5/5"
"first time i've ever been here. walked in, and all the employees told me hello. i said hi and sat down. then few minutes later more people walked in for haircuts and noticed they signed in on the computer. i figured the workers saw me so they'll just call me before these people that arrived after me. nope. took them first when it was obvious that i was there waiting for a haircut. they acknowledged me upon arrival but then i was invisible. no one told me to sign in when i arrived. that's just basic service. first and only time going there. something so simple can leave a bad taste in a possible customers mouth."
"in my life i have had less than 12 people cut my hair, not including my dad and grandma as a young kid.my last person has gotten too popular and you have to book her a couple of weeks in advance ... how many of us guys do that .... very few that i know of.this week we were in the area so i gave this sports clip a try.i was greeted as soon as we opened the door, and only had to wait a few minutes.i picked this location due to the reviews on yelp for this and others in the area.this shop didn't have as many as some, but the reviews they did have were what i was looking for.it was not as loud and obnoxious as i expected.the stylist i got was iris, very nice and took the time to ask questions, many questions!but importantly the right ones, questions no other stylist or barber had asked me before.while in the chair, there was just the right amount of small talk for someone who i had just met. other stylist in the shop had a playfull banter between them, kinda of entertaining, and not too much. i could tell they work well together.after a few snips of her clippers and scissors i could tell she had old school technique but a modern since of style, not what i expected from sports clips from the commercials i had seen on tv.iris trimmed all the other facial and back of my neck, that starts to grow and has become unruly as i age. most in the past only did this if i remembered to ask. and it usually cost more.after the cut was approved by my wife, i was taken in the back for a clean up shampoo, hot towel and scalp massage ... all while in a messaging chair!  at this point i had to ask her if i was getting a hundred dollar cut ... she laughed and said no, just a regular cut with a few extras since it was my first time in a sports clip.the shampoo iris used was invigorating! i use a mint shampoo at home regularly.but this was even better, and the tingle was more intense and lasted longer.the whole experience was very positive!no push to buy their products and the walk out price was well worth it.i will be back to see iris.the only draw back was the location was a little hard to find, it's hidden and the address is a little deceiving.  the tv's were not very sharp, almost hard to watch.and more importantly they can not do straight razor shaves. iris explained why and i understand, so i will still be seeing my barber every once in a while for that.highly recommended, ask for iris, you can't go wrong!"
really liked sharon! she took time to get the perfect haircut for my guys! we waited about 40 minutes on a busy sunday. totally worth the wait. we also got to watch the basketball playoffs!
great service. been to over 6 sports clips this ones the best!i get the mvp every time with the hot towel. i use the same stylist every time even though their system keeps track of how you like your haircut.
"one word: ""i love this place"" ok it's like 4 words but the way i'm saying it. it's a compound word lol. serious thanks for the great hair cut and the hospitality here is grade a... for amazing. thank you consuelo"
"love this place! friendly staff, super clean and always fun! plus they've got sports on tv. what's not to love??"

"great place, great environment with fun, kind, efficient, and professional associates!  in recently relocating to houston, finding a barber that was pleasant, and keeps up with the most current trends was difficult until i found consuelo at sports clips on taylor (sawyer heights).  she has been a complete gem, and making sure that my hair is cut just right to lend itself to versatile styles - from a business look to trendy style that draws positive attention!"
great people! love getting my haircut here.  diana takes care of me. been coming here for 2 years.
"the only place i get a haircut at. the staff is really friendly, and i've never been disappointed. i recommend mayra all the time. i wouldn't let anyone else touch my hair! waiting time isn't too long most of the time. came in on a monday at 6pm and no one was waiting before me.5/5"
"first time i've ever been here. walked in, and all the employees told me hello. i said hi and sat down. then few minutes later more people walked in for haircuts and noticed they signed in on the computer. i figured the workers saw me so they'll just call me before these people that arrived after me. nope. took them first when it was obvious that i was there waiting for a haircut. they acknowledged me upon arrival but then i was invisible. no one told me to sign in when i arrived. that's just basic service. first and only time going there. something so simple can leave a bad taste in a possible customers mouth."
"in my life i have had less than 12 people cut my hair, not including my dad and grandma as a young kid.my last person has gotten too popular and you have to book her a couple of weeks in advance ... how many of us guys do that .... very few that i know of.this week we were in the area so i gave this sports clip a try.i was greeted as soon as we opened the door, and only had to wait a few minutes.i picked this location due to the reviews on yelp for this and others in the area.this shop didn't have as many as some, but the reviews they did have were what i was looking for.it was not as loud and obnoxious as i expected.the stylist i got was iris, very nice and took the time to ask questions, many questions!but importantly the right ones, questions no other stylist or barber had asked me before.while in the chair, there was just the right amount of small talk for someone who i had just met. other stylist in the shop had a playfull banter between them, kinda of entertaining, and not too much. i could tell they work well together.after a few snips of her clippers and scissors i could tell she had old school technique but a modern since of style, not what i expected from sports clips from the commercials i had seen on tv.iris trimmed all the other facial and back of my neck, that starts to grow and has become unruly as i age. most in the past only did this if i remembered to ask. and it usually cost more.after the cut was approved by my wife, i was taken in the back for a clean up shampoo, hot towel and scalp massage ... all while in a messaging chair!  at this point i had to ask her if i was getting a hundred dollar cut ... she laughed and said no, just a regular cut with a few extras since it was my first time in a sports clip.the shampoo iris used was invigorating! i use a mint shampoo at home regularly.but this was even better, and the tingle was more intense and lasted longer.the whole experience was very positive!no push to buy their products and the walk out price was well worth it.i will be back to see iris.the only draw back was the location was a little hard to find, it's hidden and the address is a little deceiving.  the tv's were not very sharp, almost hard to watch.and more importantly they can not do straight razor shaves. iris explained why and i understand, so i will still be seeing my barber every once in a while for that.highly recommended, ask for iris, you can't go wrong!"
really liked sharon! she took time to get the perfect haircut for my guys! we waited about 40 minutes on a busy sunday. totally worth the wait. we also got to watch the basketball playoffs!
great service. been to over 6 sports clips this ones the best!i get the mvp every time with the hot towel. i use the same stylist every time even though their system keeps track of how you like your haircut.
"one word: ""i love this place"" ok it's like 4 words but the way i'm saying it. it's a compound word lol. serious thanks for the great hair cut and the hospitality here is grade a... for amazing. thank you consuelo"
minerva is the best stylist ever. love the on line check in .  usually busy so this saves time
"well what can i say other then i wasn't really feeling this place . i loved the set up in the shop. plenty of tvs, very colorful, plenty of chairs , very sporty. when you get there you enter your email and get sign up with them . when you check in here they offer a ten percent off on yelp. even  if they gave me 35 percent off . i for the most part won't be returning . i've had better cuts for my hair for free and then they charge us a like i think 17 dollars for this trash ass hair cut . a hair cut to me mean everything and this was some last minute because they could fit all three of us in the chair bs . so we all picked here and got jacked off . cause all of heads came out worse then how we sat in the chair . moral of the story wasn't pleased with my haircut and the pricing was not worth the outcome of my haircut."
so today me and two of my teammates wanted to get a haircut togetherwhat a mistake i should've just gone on my own elsewhere of course they put crap in your hair so you don't notice how bad it is till later now being nearly a week later i have to use products in my hair and i normally don't unless i'm going out or something but with a good haircut i don't need it.to my demise of course i get ragdoll by my wife who says why did you go there you went with your son wants and swore you would never go back well if nothing else this review will help me remember to never go back again.ps all three of us were not happy with our haircuts.
"i've been going to sports clips for the better part of the last decade. i've been to over ten different locations. this is, by far, the best sports clips i have been to. there was absolutely no wait. all the stylists seemed in sync and were churning out great snips left and right. i had jasmine but accidentally called her jessica because i didn't hear the name over everyone talking to their guests and having a great time. so relaxed! jasmine provided the most meticulous and accurate cut with minimal i put by me. i'm going back to this one every single time i need a haircut."
"7.5.2018 - called at 2:24pm. they said zero wait. arrived at 2:27pm. signed into system and said hi to hairdresser. she ignored me.  zero clients in building. sat patiently for 20mins as hairdressers sat in back and talked amongst themselves, ignoring the electronic wait system and my self. i left when i had sat there for 25mins with no service in an empty building. i went to local barber across street. business must be good at sports clip if the store can be empty with 4 hairdressers, with a patiently waiting client in lobby. screw the chains. support your local businesses."
i got my hair cut between calls with my co worker and my boss. all of us got different stylists and all ended up looking ridiculous. i don't recommend this place if you care about your appearance for the next 2wks. the stylists were very nice and talkative but lacked the skill needed to do a good job
"always a great visit!  evelyn, always the consummate professional, has been cutting my hair for years.   sport clips is the icing on the cake for my hair cutting experiences.  i'd drive from anywhere around town to visit this particular location."
"i highly recommend sports clips washington/heights location. great customer service and a great mvp cut, shampoo and style. bell took excellent care of me and i will continue to go back. what i did notice on my last visit was a stylist brushing and blow drying her hair in front of customers at her station. it maybe alright with management to do this, but i find it a bit tacky, especially if customers are waiting. do your hair in the back and on your break."
"laura did an amazing job. i like the cut and the product she recommended. i usually check in requesting ""first available"" but i will definitely request laura in the future. thanks!"
"solid location just south of the heights.  it's a bit tucked away in a shopping center facing away from the street in the new expansion area off yale, but that's a great thing if you hate long waits.  i don't think i've ever waited more than 10-15 minutes to be seen at this location.the staff is friendly and welcoming, they're very detailed in their work, and they're not pushy about upgrades-- but i usually get the mvp anyway."
"what's not to like? sports, haircut, hair wash, hot towel, and loli pop. mayra does a great job every time."
minerva is a great stylist. ask for her always!! great location and awesome team! #sportclips #haircut
"i always enjoying coming to this location. great atmosphere and friendly services! laura is my stylist, and she has perfected the way i style my hair. highly recommend her!"
"awesome job, she even recommended a hair product! love my new hair cut thanks laura!!! definitely going to come back here next time!!!!!!"
great haircut.  i got exactly what i wanted.  thanks minerva.  so far i have been very happy with this sport clips.
great service and quality! 2 for 2 so far at this new (to me) spot. laura did a great job. i was going to a competitor in the area but sport clips has them beat.
i always receive great service at this location. staff is friendly and keeps wait times down. one of the most detail oriented staffs i've seen in a while. the staff meticulously cuts hair and makes sure you walk out looking sharp.
always like how my haircut comes out at this location. bell the assistant manager does a wonderful job
"laura is great. she does an excellent job, is quick & always makes me feel important!"
another great haircut by denise.  she is awesome !!  she even did my cut on her lunch break. that's how cool n great a person she is. plus the other staff members are cool too.  the only. thing missing is a beer or wine. lol.     ken
awesome haircut! this is my place of choice. great cuts all the time!i like the ease of checking in and then getting reminders of when my spot in line is up.
"i used to go take my kids to the meyerland location. it's across the street from my apartment complex but they weren't very good. so, i looked up other locations and decided to try the med center location. well, they did a wonderful job. they're fast and precise. i really like the way they cut my sons hair. it's about 10 min from my complex. so, it's not far. i won't switch anymore. all the girls are excellent. it's great to know that it doesn't matter if you choose the ""first available"" stylist. their hair will still look good. thanks sport clips!"
"great service every time. always been very helpful, and always excellent no matter who provides their service. great advice, overall never had a problem with them."
great!briney was amazing. i love the haircut and the service. i will definitely come back and will recommend it to my friends. my wife loved it ;)
"i get my haircut like clock-work, and this location has alll the right stylists. my personal recommendation is austyn, the general manager, but they're all really good! never going anywhere else ever again. great team!"
"been here several times for a basic cut. the last time a stylist cut my hair shorter than i wanted and did not blend the fade as i asked. this time i gave specific instructions : show me the cut length before proceeding-she ignored my request and started chopping. chopped a big spot in the back of my head. after seeing it at home, i return to the salon and got attitude by the person who was suppose to fix my hair. i understand we all need to make a living but lets be honest about it- fess up to mistakes, unsure about a bare-spot ,then consult your fellow stylist and inform the client of mistakes. i am not a picky person when it comes to hair; however i am very picky about service quality.  this place gets zero stars."
great convenient location. usually short wait if you go at an odd time. expect up to 20-40 min wait time if you go on a weekend (at any location). elizabeth and brittany are great stylists who chat with me about my numerous cowlicks and improved how i can manage them. and softly breaking the news to me that i probably can't have that goodlooking short cut that the guy before me left with. they also know which products are good for my hair. they've been doing some great remodeling with lots of sunlight. the upgraded electronic checkin system is great and keeps decent records of old visits. in the past signing up for the club didn't mean much but now they actually remember my visits. recommend!
"i came here since it was convenient, but had a terrible haircut experience. i told the staff that i wanted my hair shorter, but not too short and to maintain the same style. i also reminded her that i had a bald spot to look out for. however, when she started cutting away, she ended up cutting so much to where my bald spot and a patch of my head was shown in the backside of my head. i then got a closer look through the mirror she handed me, and i saw all the uneven spots in the back. it was crazy. i was internally panicking, but she just brushed it off, saying it was just the lighting that made it appear that way. afterwards, my friends and family were like ""where did you get that bad haircut?!?"". i never wear hats, but for those 2 weeks after the haircut, i had to wear a cap, because of how my hair ended up."
store was very clean and inviting and the staff was great. my stylist austyn was very polite and listened to what i asked for.
austyn did a great job. i would definitely come back and the store was clean and the stylist were nice
"i had quite a bad haircut by brittany.  she was not courteous and rushed through the haircut, being quite harsh with cutting and shaving.  she didn't even ask me at the end if my hair looked okay.  really want a refund :(."
"i have used sports clips many times in the past, in various states from texas to mississippi. this review is directly related to this establishment as all others i've visited have been wonderful. if there were any way i could give zero stars, i would. i didn't make it past the front desk because i had at first mistaken the staff as statues since they failed to move from their obviously comfortable sitting position to acknowledge that a customer entered. they also didn't speak until spoken to; i double checked the sign to make sure i went into the right door instead of mistakenly going into a funeral: a smile would have undoubtedly broken the two female employees faces and the space-time continuum. i am, like a large part of the male population, in the ""fade phase"" of hair styles. after i asked if there was any particular person who specialized in performing said hair-cut (since i do have a choice because i'm paying money for a service), one of the girls told me rudely that everyone here has been cutting hair for a really long time and we all know how to do that cut. i, holding my tongue, told her i appreciate her time, but would be going somewhere else. i headed directly across the street to zam's hair studio where the owner, maria, gladly worked me in and gave me one of the best cuts i've ever received with a smile. hospitality, it seems, is only located on one side of west holcombe blvd."
"this is my go-to place for haircut as a rice students! located in the med center plaza, sports clips is also close to many shops and food joints so i can always take care of other errands at the same time, but even when i just want a haircut, sport clips is still my first destination to do when i'm on campus!as the name suggests, there are four hdtvs on both side of the salon, playing the most popular live sports matches of the day. by default, all four screens will show the same screen so you can't miss it when you have to turn around, but you can also request to have one screen to show a particular match that you want to see. don't worry about missing an important match for a haircut if you come here!even if you are not a huge sports fan, expect quality service from the staff here. like others have said here before, you will get a good haircut in a clean professional setting at an average price. the staff will also keep a detail of the previously requested haircut in the database too so you don't have to worry about a thing if you want the same haircut that you got last time!the bottom line is, you can't go wrong with this place!"
"two words:  horrible service.  with all of the sports clips locations in this city, you would thing they'd try a bit harder.  but no.  i signed in and waited for a half hour to get my turn, only to find out they just threw away the sign in sheet i was on.  they were hoping i'd go away because they had too many people there.  for a business to tell their customers ""go away, i don't want you here right now"" is just ridiculous.  and it is a business i refuse to give my money to.  i will never be back, and i hope no one else will either."
"can't beat the price! have been going here for the past 6 months and have had a great cut each time i go. the team listens to the requests i have and gives me their opinion what looks best (i really appreciate the opinion of those who know what they are doing vs agreeing with me as i learn how to maintain a stylish ""professional"" look.) amber, brittani, and jerica each do a great job each time i stop in. no appointment needed in advance. wait times are very reasonable, but being close to rice university there is a busier schedule during the school months."
my husband gets his haircuts here every two weeks and elizabeth does an awesome job! he has been coming to elizabeth for two years! the staff is very friendly and the shop is always clean. nothing but the best! i highly recommend this sports clips!
always get great service at sportclips along with a great haircut. i always have a friendly hair stylist.  also enjoy the mvp service.
"i usually go to another barber shop, but i was in need of a haircut close by and walked in one day without an appointment. i waited around 45 minutes before i was helped. i used the yelp check in offer. it was worth the money. my hairdresser was not very talkative, but she wasn't overly friendly either; however, i appreciate being able to watch the game on the monitors without bother. she did not cut my hair on top as requested, using the buzzer where i requested scissors. but this is a minute detail. in all, my experience was nothing special. i ended up tipping her the difference - using the money that i saved with the check-in offer. i am not sure if i would return, unless i come for the neck trims."
i went here for an emergency haircut during lunch time. it just got super shaggy fast before a big event the next day.  no wait. it was a 20 dollar haircut that took 10 minutes. i thought it was pretty expensive but the stylist actually gave me one of the best haircuts i've had.  it shaped my head very well.  so i say it was worth it
still the best place ever to get a haircut. best service ever. that's the only reason i come every week! everyone is soooooo nice. and they all seem to be able to cut great hair. but i usually only see elizabeth. she's the best! even when there's a lot of people they seem to manage it extremely well.
"my girl, jasmine, does me right every time! i was happy to find someone who understood men's cuts with fade clippers for half the price i was paying before. i'm able to feel comfortable and at ease with jasmine. at most times, she already knows what i like and if i want something new, i trust her in taking it on and how it would work for me.highly recommended!!"
"my online check-in ""appointment"" allowed me to be seen with-in 2 minutes of arrival.tori comes highly recommended, and i will be back for my next haircut!this was my first experience not only at this location, but at any ""chain"" barber shop.before: 8 inches on top combed over, 2 inch sides. original cut was in trend.after: 3 inch wave on top, starting with a 7 on the side, switched to a 5. tv's everywhere.locker room memorabilia galore.indubitably lives up to it's name!tori listened and looked at sample images with confidence.if you are in the place i was before coming in, get checked in now! just do it."
i've been coming to this location for years and all i've found is extremely good stylists.. right now i'm  waiting for jazmin... she is amazing everytime when i need a hair cut..  don't mind to wait if she is busy.. ( well ..on my days off lol. ) the rest of the stuff is also professional . thanks sportclips..
jasmine is so nice and creative. she suggested me to try something new and i did..my haircut looks amazing!
always come here every 2 weeks to get my haircut. friendly & courteous staff. shonta is awesome. keep up the good work. will be back soon.
"this is the only place i go for a haircut, the hairstylists are excellent and the wait is never too outrageous.                      ask for heather!"
went to this location when my regular spot was too 'busy' to take a walk-in. i was greeted the moment i walked through the door. check in was painless and quick. jasmine was amazing at her job. very friendly and courteous. i will be returning to this location in the future. well done sports clips!
"hubby needed a hair cut and we don't like the sport clips around our home, so we decided to try this place. they did not disappoint us at all. heather did such a great job! she knows exactly what we want and she is fast and precise. i wish we would come here earlier."
"did use this location as my preferred location. but since they ""released"" paula. i would not use this location if a million dollar interview depended on it."
"since moving into the area in 2012, i've been visiting this sports clips location for over 5 years now and have never needed to even explore any other hairdresser.what else is there to say... heather and their team are fantastic. services are well priced, their team is very friendly and down to earth and i always enjoy the cut and mvp experiences. it's something i look forward to each month!never truly had a bad experience and personally speaking, heather has always done a great job and is someone i'm glad to support. she's a great person and great leader of this local business and someone that ownership should hang on to! i can tell she has a big part to do with making the place what it is and building a culture which isn't always an easy thing when you are in a services business.i highly recommend this business and their people. as an added bonus and if you enjoy your sports, then you'll get plenty of news with their in salon tv's."
i just want to say i and my son got our hair cuts today and shanna did a great job on both my wife loved how his hair turned out.she does  awesome .thanks shanna at the store a katy mills
came here for haircuts for two of my sons. both had great stylists. they took their time with them and talked us through their recommendations vs what we thought we wanted. one of my sons can be a little picky and slow to make decisions. the stylist was extremely patient with him.bonus! they were playing yesterday's astros' win on all the screens ! go stros!hoping to add a pic here:
"heather was incredible!! mvp was a great package with haircut, shampoo, massage and clean up. very professional and knowledgeable, also very efficient, always clients in and out"
"so after my previous negative experience, i came in and spoke to heather, the same stylist, again. it looks to me like the haircut was uneven and that it was a bit longer on the right side of my head. she insisted that it's just a cowlick and that my hair grows in a different direction in that area, but she sat me down and used the the electric razor and a comb to even it out.i'll take that as a sign that she at least partly saw what i was talking about, but i'm sure she'd disagree. that said, she did offer some great recommendations about how to tackle future hair cut requests to avoid this situation recurring.i think she was about to leave for the day, but she stayed to do both the fix and an all star treatment for me. i'm in the waiting area right now updating my review as she rushed out the door.based on both trips, i highly recommend heather as a stylist. her service was a high point on the previous trip and she was exceptional in getting me taken care of on this trip."
"first time at this barber shop. i was looking for a new place and chose this barber shop because it had good reviews and had a 10% off yelp check in offer. the cut be char and mvp experience was great. however when i went to check out and wanted to redeem the 10% off (which could have been applied on top of a new customer promotion they do too), char was told by whom i believe was the asst manager that i actually needed to post a review, and show them the stars. there was no mention of this condition in the check in. that really puts a customer on the spot and forces an awkward  potentially fake 5 star review. reviews shouldn't be forced, and doing so for 10% off is like a bribe. i opt out and didn't redeem the yelp offer. otherwise, my barber char was very nice and helpful and i still left her a deserving tip."
"my 13 yo got a great cut from jasmine today! the whole process was quick, smooth, and easy. we will definitely be back!"
got my hair cut by shonta and she was friendly and professional and did a great job. thanks!
"when i was growing up sci-fi had made an illusory promise that by this time there would be a permanent technocrat solution to the regularly occurring every four week problem where it was time to get my hair did to account for the new growth, and as an adult in houston to clearly distinguish myself as not-a-homeless person since i could afford a haircut. there were supposed to be implantable chips to stop all hair growth as you preferred to switch her on and off; just the same as there were supposed to be flying cars parked in our space driveways and state of the art anime waifu 3-d wives waiting for us at home. instead the most exciting piece of tech in our life under the trump administration is taco bell's naked chicken chalupa dropping nationwide this thursday, the 26th.my mother laughed at me for going to the supercuts once - right before i went on the teevee to jaw about some 'tics (industry speak for the politics) - and she laughed at me slightly less for mentioning that i was coming here (sportclips) instead as a commonly accepted sort of upgrayedd over the count olaf's lesser-henchperson moonlighting as a haircutter cutting your hair experience at the supercuts. i don't think a cheap and easy haircut is holding me (me, a grown ass man) back in life. but maybe it is. so i actually came here to try something diff instead of continuing to go to supercuts which was convenient and easy, but at the expense of half or more of the haircuts appearing to have been done by someone who was on lean or just severely bad at their chosen profession if that was them doing it without having downed half a box of merlot just to get to the early afternoon lamenting the utter dearth of anime waifus and flying cars in grande olde 2017.my first visit here to the sportclips i got my hair did in a way which was one of the best haircuts of my life. i had to tone it down looking in the mirror so frequently and at such length until i got out of the shop and into my car otherwise i would have done jay's (of jay and silent bob infamy) full ""i'd fuck me"" scene from the film clerks ii. for $25 including a large tip this was worth every penny. this is the kind of value you want out of every purchase in life that it makes you feel like you'd fuck yourself, in the good way (consider the discussion between bettina and ruth fischer in six feet under discussing the relative value of a consumer beautification purchase in a department store versus the same expense in a grocery store buying necessary kitchen staples: ""but a bag of groceries doesn't make you want to look at yourself!"") rather than in the bad way comedian david cross identified.my second & final visit here i received one of the worst haircuts of my life. my red sox cap (jackie, owner of jackie's packie out on route 34, yells out ""go sox"" in the background) got some heavy use for about three weeks until things started to grow back enough to cover up the american war crimes that got did to my hair while i was getting my hair did. this felt like $23 too much to feel like that, especially considering we were not in tikrit any longer. that is not the right way to get your hair did, not at all.between my 5 star experience and my 1 star experience a three star is fair for balance overall.bald people have life on easy mode not needing to pay to get their hair did any more. perhaps this is what sci-fi was trying to tell 12 year old bookworm me - and to get those bald monday discounts at the neptune subs because those george costanza-looking mfs don't need to pay for haircuts and they get cheap sammiches too. that is life on the easiest mode possible.2/9/17 edit: originally a three star as posted but adjusted downward to a one star based on owner comment appended to review. sometimes silence is better than shouting into a tornado hon. you really cherry pick which reviews you respond to as well - never the obvious 5 star shills you must have paid for, or that have come from your friends, family members, or people you have otherwise enticed to shill for you on yelp. and of course you ignore the one star reviews that really knock your ass down a peg (hoang t., barret b., ana m., etc.) man, get a hobby besides yelping because you clearly suck at it (and not in the way your father excels at - if he had a yelp page i would give him five stars for what he does out back behind the dumpsters at the local dairy queen.)"
one more time i had the best haircut. my favorite tori with her magic hands. thanks again!
"heather, and all the girls at this location are amazing.some places you come in and easily have to wait close to an hour, not here. in the 10+ times i've been here the longest wait would be 20 min. easy in, easy out. although all the girls are amazing, heather goes above and beyond just a hair cut."
"what's there not to say about a free haircut and how sport clips earned it.there's a ""free mvp haircut"" coupon that gets sent in mailer packs to residents of the south bay beach cities that offers that free haircut.  usually, folks are reluctant and think there's either upsells, or strings attached.have no fear!  the coupon is legit and welcomed.  it's only good once for 1st time customers, so, once you get one and use it, you've gotten your free experience and are ineligible to use that free haircut coupon again in the future, which makes sense, since what business not being a charity, can operate giving free haircuts?  you simply can call them up, see if they're busy, show up, bring the coupon, bring your valid photo id, sign up (phone and/or email) to get into their system/database, and you get a free haircut.  for men with simple needs, it's about a 30 minute experience.the mvp treatment gets you a hot towel and massage.the manager, tam, welcomed me, processed me into the system and cut my hair.  she has a charismatic personality, and socially friendly.  i think if i come back again as a regular customer, i'd entrust tam to cut my hair again and always.if you use the coupon, it's totally free, no fees... but i'd suggest you leave a cash tip of gratuity since the haircut is roughly a $30 value.parking is rather easy and this shares the same lot as 7-eleven and an amigos tacos mexican restaurant, tucked away, but easy to find, on artesia before you reach sepulveda or the mcdonalds coming up from hawthorne/inglewood/aviation."
"if you want to be treated horribly then this sport clips is for you!i arrived at 11:40am on a saturday and there were lots of people waiting.rose told me it would be an hour wait. i said ok i will come back. i arrived back at 12:35pm and most of the waiting people were gone.the woman at the desk said she was going to take a kid before me when i asked if it was my turn yet. she took my name and said i was not in the computer. i told her rose took my name down. she said rose was on a break even though i just saw her cutting someones hair just moments before that. i had to go in the back to look for rose who admitted that she talked to me and admitted that she did not put me in the computer. i said i was not being treated fairly and demanded to be put in my original place in line. the woman at the desk asked me if i wanted to be put in the computer. i told her that i wanted to be put in the computer from 1 hour ago. i told her either treat me fairly or i will never come in here again. i have been going there for a long time (years). they didn't care about me or my business. they didn't care that rose admitted to talking to me or that i had a place in line from an hour ago. they looked at me as if i was non human and did zero to fix or acknowledge the problem and they let me walk. i called the corporate office asking for some reasonable resolution and they said that the owner would call me. of course that did not happen. keep in mind that i was a long time customer and this is the way they treated me. how will they treat a new customer? again, if you want to be treated poorly then this sport clips may be for you!"
"my son and i have been going there since they first opened. we have also referred lots of ppl there!!not sure what has happened recently but several times we have come lately they only had one stylist working and their wait was at least an hour and a half or more. also new stylists every time we go there!!last sunday i went in after going in the day before (again only one stylist) with my son and i for cuts. my son went first and i told the stylist the basic info but also said all of the info was in the computer. after a good half hour i noticed his hair cut was not even close. i talked to her again and asked if she was blending his hair on the sides and she said yes, i also said are you also cutting his hair around his colic as in the notes so his hair doesn't spike up and she said yes. another 15 plus minutes go by and i had the same questions for her and got the same answers. this time the other stylist went over to help. i went up again and told her it's still not right!! 5 minutes later a third stylist stepped in and said i was wrong that the lady was cutting his hair right! i said no other person there has cut it wrong before!  i told them to stop because my sons school pics were the next day and it was only getting worse and her response was to have the lady cut his hair even shorter.my son always got his hair cut with a #1 clipper and a nice clean blend on the back and sides. he normally spiked his hair in front messy land the top by his colic layer cut so his hair would lay down nice.my 13 year old told me later the stylist never even looked at the info in the computer which all the previous stylists normally would print out. she also told my son that his dad wasn't listening to her!at that time i told them we were done!!!the lady gave me the owners name and said to contact them during the week. i'll never go back!"
"it's a nice place to go and get the basic men's haircut as that's what they usually do at these places that have a brand name logo. they got lot's of sports channels playing on their television sets while your either waiting or getting the haircut. they wash your hair and rinse it out. not sure about women getting a haircut unless they are into getting a short haircut style like the men who does get that certain look style. they will take you with and without an appointment. i was given free cards to pass out to recommend the one who had cut my hair and yes i liked it, even that i wanted more shorter, but they didn't have the machine to do so. you will get a free haircut after so many going back to the same person who had cut it for you. the haircuts prices are so and so reasonable if you earn a lot of money and willing to spend for all the things that they do for the haircut you want while wanting to watch your sports channels as they will change it to your current sports your into.. that's right, you won't miss a football or baseball game as all you got to do is ask if they can put your current play game on their television sets and just enjoy it while you are waiting until called or getting the haircut ."
"who owns this franchise? this is a revolving door of hairstylists that can only indicate two things. the company treats its employees like dispensable minimum wage dogs, or the owner treats them like ______!as a rather loyal customer to the chain i have lost all hope in it and i refuse to blame it on the stylists. this is corporate ineptness and marketing cult behavior. on my last visit 3 weeks ago i stood in the doorway waiting almost 20 minutes for a cut while there was not one other customer in the joint. as i occupied myself patiently on my phone 2 hairstylists listened intently but terrified to the 3 corporate managers and the owner lecture them on ""best practices"". how the mvp up-sell was crucial to the business profits and conditions of their employment. both staff members nodded in hesitant agreement to the scripted blabber while occasionally glancing over at their one and only customer. everyone could clearly see me waiting, getting progressively agitated. i finally decided i had enough after 20 minutes and proceeded to leave. one of the clippie clan in matching logo shirts and clipboard asked me if i needed a cut to which i simply replied, ""sorry, rcustomers come first and clearly you are the ones not paying attention"". by the time i got to my car the owner (?) ran out and offered me a free haircut. unfortunately much too late."
"this is my regular haircut spot and i will continue coming back. after checking in during a busy time, i left to run errands only to return and find out that my name had already been called. tam recognized that i had previously checked-in and still saw me as soon as she could. she turned the bad mood i was in into a good one and gave me a haircut that will keep the ladies swiping right (i hope!!) tam, you're the mvp."
"i've been in this store for about an hour. i walked in around 4pm and there was one customer with one stylist. the second stylist was not available - nor did i know anyone else was here. after the stylist who greeted me finished with her customer she then alerted myself and the gentleman before me that she would be leaving. there had been one check-in online ahead of the one person waiting and myself - he didn't show up until 15 min after 4. they put him in front of me. the stylist that was unavailable who i never saw was apparently with a customer working on a fade that took over a half hour. i never heard them and was very confused as to where they were for about 40 min? if it takes her that long to work on one persons fade than i can't imagine how long it would take her to cut my hair let alone the dude in front of me. the stylist that is currently working is carrying on a conversation and is taking her time and the stylist who greeted me continues to tell myself and everyone that she's working off the clock to assist. the customer who is in front of me, timothy, checked in online at 3:45pm. only one person was with the current stylist since that time. this is a waste of my time and everyone else's time. it's now 5:05 pm. a mom and her son that came in after me already walked out before me. i've decided to leave."
one of the worst cuts i've ever had. told her to snip the ends off and she takes 3 inches off. butchered me!then they cant figure out how to clear a previous sale in the pos system. i gave em the worst $22 in cash that i've ever spent and got out of there!
"i go for a simple thing , first time going into this "" sports clips"" i sit down and the lady whose going to do my haircut and line up . starts with the line up first i can feel her hurting me with the machine , she does a terrible job doing a simple line up. when she shows me the back of my hair line , i knew i shouldn't get a haircut from her so i just told her i don't need a haircut and she still charged me $5 when the hairline was obviously lopsided and just terrible. dont go to this place, i recommend stormys chop shop."
terrible haircut. i was waiting for nearly an hour when there was a mixup with the line since the pos system was out. the lady who cut my hair was nice but it was her second day on the job and my haircut came out uneven.
"our boys have been getting their haircuts here for about 2 years.  the haircuts are generally ok.  but the wait time is consistently terrible.  on weekends, the place is packed.  even when there are 5 stylists, they don't move customers through efficiently. and the process to check out and pay is painfully slow. we wouldn't mind waiting for an amazing haircut.  but we don't get amazing haircuts and come here for the convenience.  but, it's not convenient when it's super slow.  they just implemented a new self check in system.  it looked like it would make things more efficient, but it has kinks and made the process even slower. we are going to start taking our boys someplace else."
"wow....asked for a ""5"" on the sides and the back and got a ""2"" all the way up to the top of my head....not even a 3 or a 4 but a two !      when i reminded her that i asked for a ""5"" and that my printed record indicates a ""5"" on sides/back she said ""oh, i'm sorry"".    it was as if she had never cut hair before.by far the worst haircut i've ever had....uneven and not even close to what i asked for.  don't go here if you like your hair cut the way you want it."
"watched 4 people walk out over the last 45 min i've waited here... stupid slow, people complaining in waiting room about how slow... do not come here in the eve not worth it it's like the dmv... with one person doing hair..."
"i have been getting my haircut there for almost a year now and i will only let kristen cut my hair and boys hair. she is amazing. ask for her every time. unfortunately today i had the worst experience today whilst getting my hair cut. kristen was by herself and in the middle of cutting my hair when the phone started to ring. it rang probably 6 different times. it turned out is was a worker named yolanda. not only was she late (there were 4 people waiting for haircuts) but she was for some reason screaming at kristen. kristen told her she was in the middle of a hair cut and told her she needed to go. this employee called another three or four times. if this had been my first time at this location i would not come back. i don't know who this other employee yolanda is but her behavior is unacceptable, abusive and disrespectful. if i was rating my experience today, it would be a 1 star.if i were the owner, i would staff more people because i watched 5 customers come in and see only 1 employee cutting hair and left. in the time i was there i watched over $100 worth of business leave. if kristen leaves, i will no longer get my kids or my hair cut there."
don't waste your time here. stylists chat while customers wait. cuts have been consistently terrible and staff just seems incompetent. came here for convenience. found fantastic sams is in the same plaza and much better.
if you get kristen it is worth every penny.  she is a skilled and talented hair stylist (not that i need one) but the best part is she likes her job and makes you laugh.  next time i am going for the mvp as she is said to have the best hands in the business!
kristin is the best. gives a great relaxing haircut. by far the best there is at this location. she is the only reason i go here. others try to rush you through but she is all about giving you a great haircut and takes her time to make it an enjoyable experience. she is worth double the cost!!
they took forever to cut my sons hair and left him looking like lloyd christmas. worst haircut ever. there's not a single piece of hair that was cut evenly on his head.
"hey sport clips owner, pay attention. i don't know if you like your stylists turning people away because that's what they're doing. check your cameras. i walked in at 4:13 today. i'm in your store as i type.dawn greeted me as i walked in and greeted me with ""it's 4:13, your looking at a 45 minute wait""- not hello, not hey welcome... those were the first words out of her mouth. i looked around, two people ahead... i call her bluff and say, it's okay we can wait. i can feel her irritation.you currently have two people working. a father comes in at 4:16 and she says, as he opens the door, "" it's 4:16, there's a 45 minute wait and we close at 5"" - he gets the hint and leaves. i'll update this an a few minutes.edit 4:22: rose just came up and greeted us and was very sweet. rose 1, dawn 0edit: 4:50 someone just walked in... rose told him, uhhh, we close at.... when she gets done (points at rose in the back) we'll take you.edit: 5:20 we just got finished with our haircut. typing this outside the salon now. dawn did cut my sons hair great. she was friendly with him. it was a little awkward for the both of us, given the first impression she gave me. i give her credit for not rushing the cut despite being closed.final review: would i come back, yes. just to see. i'm hoping it was a bad day and dawn just felt like she had to go home. otherwise, post a sign that says last client in at 4:15 or close earlier. maybe these people need to get paid more so they don't mind keeping the client list open until 5. hope you guys figure it out. seems to be a hit or miss. rose 1. dawn 2"
"i went a few months ago. i had a free haircut coupon to use. so i walk in and put my name down, it was the weekend so there was going to be a wait. i looked around the place is targeted for guys of course, all sports stuff around and tv playing football at the time. after waiting an hair the girl comes up to help me, she seems exhausted. i give the coupon she automatically goes into a monotone sales pitch about what they do there, what the different costs are for the packages of haircuts / messages, etc. i understood there a new business and looking for customers so it doesn't bug me.here is the part the that really gets me. as she starts working my hair i ask her to clean up my beard. she tells me they don't do that, ummm what?! this is a barber shop that is target for men to go to and they won't trim a beard with a buzzer or anything? i couldn't care less about the sports novelty stuff and the hot towel on the face and the massaging chair. i got to a barber shop to get my hair and beard trimmed. overall i think the package i paid for was about $35 (i could be wrong on price) and it only took her about 20 mins to show me everything they do for that package. i hope if you pay for it it would last longer but i really doubt it. but for me i will go to the supercuts in the shopping center behind this place and get my hair and beard done in about 20 mins in and out instead for being at this place for an hour and half and still didn't get what i needed done."
"i had a great experience getting my hair cut here last week, despite the craziness that is the parking lot this sport clips shares with a handful of other businesses. viridiana cut my hair, and did an excellent job. i traversed the friday afternoon traffic to come here because the la canada location had a crazy 72 minute wait! i was the only one getting my ears lowered for the first 20 minutes approx., and i was very happy with the final product. i always go for the mvp, and i was even convinced to buy a hair dryer just so i can style my hair in the same awesome way it looked that day. if you can brave the surprisingly busy parking lot, this is a good place for a good cut."
"cherish, my daughter's hair stylist since she was 1, moved from the kiddie salon down the street from our house to this sports clips for men that's about 10 miles away and we followed her! idk how she does it but she's the only person that's able to cut my daughter's hair. the 2 times i went to someone else, they totally messed up her hair! and cherish was so nice to fix it both times! anyways, now about this salon :) it is primarily for men and i could see why guys would like it. sports on all the tvs all the time. you log on, reserve a spot in line and show up for your haircut. what's not to like?"
"i knew i shouldn't have come here. i usually go to a barber but i was in the area and needed to wash some product out of my hair. carla is the worst if you need a cut. this is the second time she cut my hair and second time it was awful. i said ""lower because i don't like high fades""...what did i get? a high fade. i just paid a lot of money for a shitty cut. i went a full refund"
"highlightscleanliness: spotlessstaff: super friendlyquality: great haircutsprice: pretty reasonable wait: manageable (0-30 mins)pro tip: if you don't want to wait, they have an online check-in system now. i've been going to this place for at least 3 years now  and always leave with a great haircut and a smile. i always ask for valerie. she's easy to get along with, funny, and always cuts my hair the way i want it. they have great mvp season passes before which gives you 6 mvp haircuts for the same price as normal haircuts. i wish they bring them back. 10/10 would recommend."
candice is the best over at this sports clips! she's nothing short of perfection when it comes to cutting or styling hair. thank you candice for being awesome and giving an amazing cut! kia is also amazing! she's on point with those cuts! thank you kia!
"they wouldn't replace a lost coupon card that already had 3 stamps on it. all they could do was look up on my record and give me a new stamp card. they just said ""no, you are screwed."" what a customer service."
"my son daniel had a hair cut today, you know he will be back to school a week from tomorrow so his dad took him over. danirl came back home telling me how awesome it was. from the scalp massage to the hairstylist (carla).  my son is 13 and she was kind to ask along the way how he wanted and if he liked it or wanted the hair a bit shorter. he has been there before and will continue to go there, but asked me to add the review for him. super clean place, organized, friendly staff. i'm a happy mom!"
"great place to get a cut.  valarie did a super job, staff is nice and friendly,  wait isn't long at all."
"first time in, melody was my barber. she was very attentive and professional. she knew how to fade and line up my hair just the right way. the mvp special for first timers is epic as hell. would definitely recommend."
we brought our 4 and 6 year old boys here this weekend after not liking the kids salon cuts lately. we were able to walk in with no problem. the women were all so nice and gave my boys darling haircuts. they even put color in at the end for a fun touch. it made the lack of toys ok in the eyes of my boys. we will definitely be back. thanks!
"all the women there are awesome, kind, and so patient. for a few bucks more i do suggest the mvp. candice cuts my hair and i love my hair when i leave. i'm never going to supercuts again!"
"s-o   slow!!came in before closing, there were two stylist but they didn't seem too experienced.i would compare them to a grade lower than super cuts.we called in yesterday to get a haircut but they said there would be a 40 minute wait. so we came today, not too long of a wait, but very slow service. inexperienced stylist."
"i have to say wow, reyna is amazing in haircut and massage. make sure to get mvp package. it's same price as other place but you get more here. plus you get to watch your sport. i love my baseball games. i enjoyed it here. almost didn't want to leave haha.  thank you reyna!"
"this place is definitely the best place to get a haircut. if you want to get a specific type of hairdo, they will get it exactly right, and they will cut your hair perfectly, plus the steamed towel and massaging shampoo is definitely a bonus. i will definitely come back for another great haircut!"
"this place is perfectly decent for the price.the haircuts here are not going to blow your mind but i have gone 4 times and each time i was sat down in a chair within 10 minutes.  each of the ladies who have cut my hair were nice and did a decent job.  i would say they went a bit off script but the haircuts were still decent, just not something where i would go any distance for a cut here.  all 4 haircuts were described the same but all 4 haircuts were a bit different.  i have been getting the same cut for most of my adult life, so i have a basic descriptive script for a barber/stylist.  i really want to find a place that can nail the haircuts i want consistently, and that will give me that old style barber shop experience without a bunch of tvs and upsells.one thing that might be important to you is--i think this place is great for kids and teens.  i don't have kids but it seems that they do a great job on the under 18 guys (and even girls) here.  for example, my close friends has a special needs daughter that has had issues with letting people cut and wash her hair.  this is the only place they go and they nail her hair every time + she likes them washing her hair!! that is a big deal for them.  i have another friend with a daughter that gets ridiculously cute cuts here as well.  last, i have a friend who takes his son here, and his cut is always fresh and clean and cute because he looks like a proper little gentleman after his cut and style every time.i would go here if you are close but do not travel out of your way unless you have kids and are striking out in your area.  for me this place is super convenient and they give decent cuts, so i will go.  if i had to travel very far to this spot, i would just go to another similar type spot."
"this place is great! candice was my barber - she worked with patience and precision and was more than kind enough to laugh at my terrible jokes. she gave me a great cut that is sure to get me more matches on tinder (just kidding, i'm a lost cause). overall, a very skilled and fun team there, and they all know what they're doing (i've been around la quite a bit; i can smell a bad barber from a mile away). it was my first time here, but i'll most definitely be coming back, even if i don't know a damn thing about sports. thanks candice, because of your wonderful cutting skills, i can face the world a new man."
"horrible, horrible. could not have been a worse experience. * understaffed* disorganized* overpricedwaited over an hour for a haircut. nobody was working the front counter. 6+ empty seats in the ""haircut area"". terrible utilization of resources and staff. shocking first impression of low standards and lack of care. in the end, the haircut looks great."
"have been to a number of sportclips and actually they are my go to place.  visited this location and honestly am not seeing what all the others do.  in terms of the service, they were reasonably nice, but also non-chalant.  went in during the week and not extremely busy, just didn't get that same vibe that i did visiting a couple other stores in this franchise.haircut was actually just ok.  person seemed kind of confused when i asked for scissor cut and they wanted to fall back to using the clippers..... and then did just an ok job.  all in all not sure about this location."
it's nice to watch a game and get my haircut for a reasonable price. candice is the best.
i've been searching for a good shop for a good price that i'll walk out looking and feeling good.  i was a bit skeptical because it was a chain but after i called them they were super friendly and i decided to give them a chance.  candice took very good care of me and listened to what i wanted. i'll be back in a couple of weeks for sure.
amazing customer service. i drive 20 min just to go to this location even though there is one near my house. i have never had a complaint about my haircut from this place. silva and juanita are my go to. people when i go here. the rest of the staff is also amazing as well. silva and juanita always provide excellent customer service and give great haircuts!this location is the true mvp
"tell them it is your first time for free mvp!! i recently went to sportclips to get my haircut. i recommend silva, as she knew exactly how to do my hair.. however she tried to sell me on some items for sale.if you get the mvp cut (free if you say it's your first time) i recommend the cold towel, not the hot towel. it burned my face. the chairs massage you, then there is a massaging session.ask for silva"
"juanita is probably the best hair/beard stylist is la... if you go to sports clips in noho on lankershim, i highly recommend booking with her if you want excellence!"
"first time client.  always heard the advertisements on the radio/tv and was seeking somewhere close to home.  arrived shortly after it opened and was serviced by carolina.  very friendly and attentive.  cut my hair exactly how i wanted. she even explained my haircut would be put on file for next time to avoid any confusion or explanation how i liked my cut.  and as a first time client, i received a complimentary vip shampoo and neck massage. (the vip is an add on w/ haircut) i also learned sc will do complimentary neck trimming between haircutsif you want something simple with a little bit of frills like shampoo and neck massage, i highly recommend this sport clips."
"the worst haircut experience of my life! the store was not bad just the service of the man cutting my hair. he was a very rude old man i believe his name was justin he has a beard. he asked how i would like my hair i said,""can i do a taper to a zero he handed me the hair clipper as if he was very pissed off, initially ones instinct is to laugh because you'd think it was a joke well it wasn't he literally handed it to me telling me as if expecting me to cut my own hair... and once doing the haircut he tapered the sides to a 2 and saidhe couldnt go any lower i've gone to many barbershops and yes you can. this wasn't worth a 20dollar haircut i could havegone to any barbershop and paid 8 dollars for a far higher quality haircut. by far worst experience and worst haircut ever! never again will i go to any sports or refer anybody to goto one i really hope you talk to this man or train him on how he should give customer service. also id like to speak to a manager and see if theres anything i could do to get that money back because it was a complete waste of money! to add on the line up was not straight i asked a few times for him to fix it amd it did not come out well. i fixed it myself when i got home."
"i like to get these haircuts done pretty early in the morning and sports clips was open and ready to go at 10:02 a.m. i showed up. i signed in using my phone number the norm nowadays with sports clips and before i could even take a seat yvette called my name. super polite and nice which is again usually the norm for most of these sports clips. she reviewed my notes from the previous time i had visited that sports clips ( in between my two visits i had gone to another sports clips where i was not nearly as happy with the job that was done.) i showed her a picture as well of the look i was going for and she got to work. we had a bit of small talk that wasn't forced. let's face it nobody likes it when you can tell someone is really trying to make a conversation happen. we joked about old hairstyles we used to do as kids, ask my opinions on fading in my sideburns and some other details of the haircut that don't really matter here because before i knew it she was done and i was in and out of this sports clips in 30 minutes. i would definitely suggest anyone looking for a $20 sports clips haircut to come to this one. the place was clean everyone there was very polite and although the parking lot is a little small it's pretty easy to get into. i definitely plan on coming back again and specifically asking for yvette because he'll, i'm a creature of habit and she was pretty cute. haha"
"i brought my nephew in for a 'mvp' experience. he was super excited all day because he had read about the hot towel and the massage! he was so cute going in and we had mark help us. he is 11 and knows exactly what he wants - a buzz cut #1 and a hard line!  i had no idea what that meant but i found out!  he loves his cut,  mark did a great job...and he got a cold towel plus the hot towel!  he said his favorite part though was the massage!!  we will definitely be bringing him back!"
"love this location, always clean, and never a long wait.jennifer is very patient with our 8 year old son, she always cuts his hair just the way we want it.glad i found this hidden gem."
"i used to be a regular at floyd's before, and had a few bad haircuts recently.  i heard the ads for sport clips on espn radio and noticed there was one in north hollywood.  so i ventured out.the appearance struck me first.  it's a very 'sports' kind of atmosphere, but not in the kind of way your dad's basement is.  it's a very clean and well kept establishment.  they had the nfl combine on the tv's (and the tv's are huge), which was a really nice touch.  i got my haircut by silva.  the hair cut was good and just how i wanted it to look.   because it was my first visit, they upgraded me to vip for free.  the vip is nice and i appreciated them giving it to me on the house, but i don't think i'd get it again.  but silva did a great job at it.  i mentioned my hair was starting to thin up front and she recommended some products for my hair  (i didn't get any, but i may next time).  the service was outstanding. silva was friendly and nice and i look forward to my next haircut with her.  highly recommend this place."
"i've been going here for about 5 months now, and i would highly recommend carolina. i've had haircuts with more than 6 individuals there and i haven't really ever been satisfied with any haircut they have given me. carolina has been the only one who has gotten it right. she takes her time, she understands and listens to what i'm asking for, builds a relationship, and takes care of her customers. she's the one you need to look for at sports clips. she's the best of the best!"
"not only did sherene take my vague instructions and make my unruly hair look great, she was also super friendly! i was desperately in need of more hair product too, the ""matterial"" ultra-matte finish mitch pomade is a great product if anyone is looking for recommendations."
this place is great. silva always does the best job. she even fix my bad haircut that i got last time from another stylist thank you silva.
"worst experience ever!girl couldn't even know, how to hold a comb. haircut lasted 45 minutes.afterwards, she ruined my hairline in the back of my neck! i specifically asked her to taper it! i gave her $5 tip.  i wish they kept a dry cleaners instead!run from this armatures!"
came in just before closing and they took care of me. shirin is amazing! she took her time and really paid attention to detail. i love my fresh look. they really make you feel like family here. i will definitely be back.
"my first time here and had the best experience!  i only give it 4 stars because of the wait time .  i had to wait about 25min as a walk in since there was only one stylist at the time.  i would suggest signing in on the app before walking in.  other then the wait it was fantastic ! hair looks amazing, she did exactly what i wanted and it was quick.  got the upgrade to mvp for free since i was a first time customers.  hooked!  totally worth it! they even do free neck trims in between cuts.  i'll definitely be coming back!"
"came in late-ish and was warmly welcomed by nicole. she was super nice and friendly and did exactly what i asked for my haircut. she even gave me the ""mvp"" treatment since it was my first time at their location. would definitely recommend!"
"great service, very clean facility, great cut! $20 gets you a cut a wash and a mini massage, so it's an awesome deal too. i was hesitant to come here because i've been going to the same person for 6 years at an upscale salon but i just moved out here and didn't want to spend a fortune and i'm glad i didn't have to! will definitely come back"
"shirin was awesome. she was pleasant, professional, and very good. my hair felt great and looked great and i don't think i've ever walked away from a haircut without the prickly hairs in my shirt...basically she is a wizard with hair"
i got the $15 for $25 deal on yelp and damn if i won't pay the whole $25 next time for the mvp combo (it even includes a shoulder massage!). shirin is an amazing hair stylist and the best chatter in the business. i had a great time and extremely satisfied with my haircut.
"ive been living in la for almost 3 years now and have been having a hard time finding the perfect barber for me. i can be very anal about my hair. luckily, by chance i came across sportsclips because it just opened, and figured i'd give it a shot! im happy that i did because this is where i came across silva. she is such good person and an amazing soul. i can be very talkative and i need to have chemistry with my barber or its a no go. she suits all my needs and on top of that she really aims to please. shes a terrific stylist, a professional, and just an amazing human being. go to sportsclips lankershim and ask for silva. you will not be disappointed."
"i have been in here a few times, for beard trims. 5 bucks, what a deal! i don't have much hair, so unfortunately i cannot enjoy all of their services. i had great experience recently with (oh i hope i get her name right) yvette. she did my beard up proper, went the extra mile, had good small talk, and was all around cool af! she said if i put some purple in my grey beard it would be ""magical"" lol. i'll be back for sure. she had me smiling."
"a lovely lady named nehar did my husband's hair.  he got the mvp.  the cut looks fantastic!  next time we're in burbank when he needs a cut, we'll be back for nehar."
"this place is amazing! a+ 5 star! the massage chair experience is a must try ... so relaxing! yvette was kind, personable and efficient! definitely coming back to this place!"
"i'm really sad i didn't know about this place earlier. it's now my go to location for a haircut. the funny thing... i don't care about sports... not at all. the people that work here are amazing. you can register into their system so they have on record just the way you like your hair done. there's public parking. it's a fantastic establishment. this last time i got my hair cut by christina... i believe that's her name. she was conversational, charismatic, polite, fun; and of course she did a great job with my hair. what impressed me more so was how kind they were to an elderly gentlemen that was getting his hair cut just before me. christina and the other wonderful lady were exceptionally patient and courteous with this man. he wasn't too keen on all the technology involved with the initial check-in process and they spoke with him in a manner of empathy that made me proud to be a human... which doesn't happen very often nowadays. i wanted to take a detour from my normally insane and whimsical reviews to seriously acknowledge two beautiful people doing their jobs very well. good job ladies."
my son got the worst haircut here a few months back but i assumed it was a once off so we went back and his hair cut the other day was even more ridiculously bad- i mean completely uneven!!.  went back the next day (yesterday) to have them fix it and it still looks terrible.  won't be back-
"amazing and efficient. staff was very pleasant and a great haircut. the staff was lively and made me feel very welcome. first haircut you get the mvp treatment for free which includes massage, shampoo and hot towel."
"i took my brother here for a mid fade & he received the worst haircut ever. it took 2 of the hair stylist to try & fix it and still left his hair uneven & cut it way too high. the 1st woman who attempted to cut his hair gave me a fake excuse that ""she was feeling sick"". & we still paid for the messed up haircut respectfully. but i highly suggest going to an actual barber who actually knows how to fade & cut hair. this place only cuts basic styles at a high price. never returning here again."
i went there today for my 10 years old to get a hair cut they seriously ruined poor kids hairthe lady that was cutting his hair was older ladyand we got home after he took shower i saw that it's all uneven cut and lines all over sideno more going here disasterwhy r u guys hiring people like this???i really trusted u guys until tiday
"i'm giving 1 star for the poor customer service. i came in yesterday at about 4:10. they close at 5pm. there was about 6 ppl ahead of me. fine no problem. but when it's almost 5pm and still 6 ppl ahead of me because the employees are too busy joking, laughing, having nonsense conversations and taking breaks when ppl r waiting....that's when i lose my patience. of course i got up and left. then i came back this morning...they open at 10am. i was early and waited. now it's about 10:10 and they are still hanging out in the back talking. i mean come on there are customers waiting. u don't even apologize or acknowledge that there are ppl waiting. poor customer service. won't come to this location again."
"i've been going there since they opened years ago. the same two girls have been cutting my hair for years now. lately the last few times i've been there, these new people are terrible. waiting when there's a large line is one thing and understandable. not when there's nobody ahead of you but the girls rather joke around and talk to each other rather than cut hair. or another time when there was a large line. i decided to wait. what a big mistake. almost an hour and the line hadn't moved. not once! one of the girls disappeared in the back for 30 min. i would think maybe she was on lunch but it was right before closing. the other girl was done with her customer but sitting there talking and talking. not for a min but no exaggeration, 15 min. nonstop. this place has no respect for the customer or your time. save yourself and go somewhere else! you've been warned."
"i don't like writing negative reviews. i last went here in december. the normal person i go to wasn't there, but i was in a hurry and said, ""sure!"" right off the bat there seemed to be miscommunication, even though it's supposedly written on the paper. i tried to leave, but then i had the stylist, the manager, and another stylist, all tell me to sit down and not worry about it. she then jacked up my hair. i asked for there to be 3 inches left on top. she left half an inch on one side realized her mistake, then left then combed over the 3-4 inches left on the other side. it was bad folks. sadly, i was so frustrated that i paid (and tipped) before i realized my mistake. once i did realize the issue, i immediately went back in and had it recut by my preferred stylist. i was given no apology. no refund. no credit. nothing. i reached out to the company and the store for a response. nothing.i tried to go back today to just get a free neck and ear trim while i was on errands. they wanted to charge me $5 even though i have a record of going back to them. don't go here guys. the people are friendly, but they have horrible customer service and the company's discounts continue to get worse (what happen to the free haircuts on your bday month???), and their prices continue to go up (it was $17 two years ago, it's now $22). only come here if you are in dire need of a haircut."
"well gentlemen!! i must say if you need a haircut you have come to the right place. with out a doubt the ladies and gentlemen who work at this location know what they are doing. i have been coming here for almost two years and i have never had a problem. the cuts are clean, quick, and professional. i have been to many other places including but not limited to fantastic sams, super cuts, and even more glorious mom and pop shops that charge an arm and a leg!! but the one thing they all lack is consistency and overall cleanliness. that is why i choose sports clips. they have system and it works. plus if your feeling special you can upgrade to a nice hair wash and a back massage. you can't beat it."
"so i needed a cut bad and i was yelping for a place and found that location had a deal on yelp so naturally i had to give it a try. i was able to call in and get 20 min wait on a wednesday afternoon. the lady who cut my hair, yvette, knew what i wanted right away and we were done within 20 mins. i got the mvp treatment which included a shampoo scalp massage and a hot towel on the face. afterwords, i got a quick hair blow dry and hair wax applied to my hair. yvette has good soft skills, friend and personable, and has been at this location when they first open (about 8 years). so, goto her if you want to have a good conversation while getting a cut. overall a good experience and probably will back here."
"very awesome experience. i was in and out in 20 mins, literally. went on a thursday evening, there was one person ahead of me and two people finishing up. the girl cutting my hair, adrianne, i think, was super nice and very efficient. she took me to the chair, we chose a style from the book of pics and about 15 mins later we were done, complete with a hot towel, shampoo and scalp massage. very cool experience!i've never had such a fast haircut, which i actually liked! definitely coming back here!!!"
"came to sportclips in burbank today and had the royal treatment for my son!! vanessa took care of him and turned a terrible hair cut into an awesome one!!! vanessa took the time and walked us through what would be good for his hair style!!  i will be back for vanessa to take care of my son in the future!!  thank you so much vanessa, now i feel comfortable having my son walk for graduation!! great with kids!!"
came here on a monday at around 1230. place was super packed .  checked in online and decided to come back later. came back at appointent time.  i was next. waited 15 minutes and no one greeted also the let another person behind me in line first. won't be back
"here you'll find one if the best hairdresser in burbank.go see nehad - she is extremely professional, precise and always very joyful.i'll definitely be a returning customer!"
"this place is really a hit or miss. i realize that two very big factors that will affect your haircut is the stylist and whether they are busy or not. it seems like they are constantly raising their prices too! i mean i don't mind paying a bit extra but at least have the haircut come out nice with attention to detail. if you happen to arrive when they are busier than usual or close to closing time they will rush your hair cut thinking it will go unnoticed. the result is a bad uneven haircut that you have to end up paying a lot for, i know from experience.there are very few stylists here that would do a good job but they are all very friendly. i will say that i do like how they welcome walk-in appointments, the place is kept pretty clean and the computer system they use keeps track of your preferred hair style (clip size, length, etc.)"
not great haircut but ok for the priceprobably will be backnice people working there
been coming here for 4 years and never had a bad experience. everyone is great and super nice. they always get you in and out quick and the mvp is awesome.
"i've been coming her for the last two years and my experiences have been up and down. reviews should really be stylist by stylist, but i'm forgiving all previous sins bc i just got the best haircut of my life. in and out in less than 10 minutes. diamond, the current manager, cut my hair. it was like she had been doing it her whole life. she didn't have to go back over any clipper mess ups or over cut any of the scissor sections. blended and rounded on one pass. everything was damn near perfect. im so freaking impressed. and on top of it all, she used the mini mirror so that i could see the back of my head. i never really understood how to do this. but she gave me 5 distinct angles, all of which i now realize i needed to be checking: rear left/right straight and up along with the neckline. f'in amazing. also, she was telling me about hiring new stylists. she actually screens for talent, so i expect everyone working for her to be capable. bravo."
"had a slightly bad experience today. logged into the advertised online check-in. arrived on time to duck in and get a cut before going back to important work. sat down. waited a bit and new manager called the person below me on the list. this is against the spirit of the process. i now have to wait 24 extra minutes. new manager explains something about she had told his person he'd be next. why did you go against the set out process? people count on what is stated as the way this will be done. i'm probably the longest held customer here through all the manager changes. no real ""sorry"" for this. could be worse. but i mentioned it when finally getting a cut and didn't want to dwell on it. manager was a little aggressive about this being her prerogative. interrupted and talked over my short mention of concern -- made it a less pleasant experience. if i accept losing 24 minutes of my time i'd rather just get a ""sorry"" than someone who will interrupt me when she broke the process to provide a favor. oh well. floyds is nearby. -----great towels and massage for slightly more than i pay at other places but it's pretty great. need to wear gloves if you are going to smoke and then come back in to cut hair;)"
"dont let pr cut your hair!!!! my fiancé went yesterday to get his hair cut. he told pr exactly what he wanted numbers and all. he showed her where he wanted his taper to start as well. tell me why she literally took a # 1 allllllll the way up the sides of his head.. where's the taper??  who has flat top hair cuts these days?? that's exactly what my fiancé's hair looks like.  there is no taper between the sides and top of his hair!! he is sooooooo pissed with your work! pr, you need to go back through training and learn how to properly cut men's hair!"
i go here virtually every 2 weeks and get my hair cut. diamond impressed me 5 ways from sunday (expression). its almost like she is an artist at this! i'm super impressed and happy. thanks
"been coming here for 4 years and a consistent season pass holder. have had excellent managers and stylists through out. today's experience was not how a customer should be treated. i had 4 hair cuts left before today and after the hair cut, the manager (diamond) says we'd have to punch two. she then said the system doesn't even show i have a seasons pass and to prove it wanted to show me how other customers have it in the system. after trying it out for 3 other customer names - she couldn't really show anything. everyone has it exactly like how my information appears. she couldn't prove anything. i told her that lauren the previous manager had provided me with a compensation hair cut because of an issue and it's not fair for her to take it away. after a while of explaining, she stuck to taking away the ""compensated"" hair cut that was given to me. it felt like just to prove a point. it's not about the money at this point - it's about treating a customer fair. i didn't ask for the compensated hair cut previously, i sure didn't ask for it to be taken away after being offered. ugh! it's not customer's fault if the system doesn't have it recorded.again - it's a great place and am sure diamond is a good stylist and a nice person. but the treatment today was unwarranted."
"this place has gone way downhill.  the nice ladies have been replaced by mean ones.   one goth girl cutter, diamond, wanted to charge me twice to make me happy with my kids haircut, i asked for a 2 minute fix of a crooked hairline that she did.  she wanted more money, and only 4 minutes after the bad cut.  me and my two boys are never coming back."
"this place is trash. dont come here. the manager, lauren, is rude and very confrontational. goes back and forth with customer on a busy day in front of everyone, customer pays and she continues to talk about him after he leaves. owner should be more aware."
"came here thinking i was going to get a clean haircut but don't let the nice location and good looking establishment fool you, raylene was the person that cut my hair. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if your  male go to a real barber shop, if your s woman go to a beauty salón.i asked for a simple taper and she couldn't even do that, okay it safe and go to a barber shop, even if you get a free haircut coupon, it's not worth the trouble"
my name is lauren and i am the manager of sport clips el segundo location. id like the give a review of our fabulous customers. thank you for being loyal customers to our store.
"this place was great for a few years, but all the talented employees have left.  now you are stuck with a fast food-style haircut.   sloppy, fast, and a big push to get you out the door within the guidelines.  this used to be my monthly spot...  now i'll pay a bit more for greater confidence in the quality and consistency of the haircut."
"we showed up with two minutes to spare before closing time and they gladly gave my son a great haircut!  so friendly and accommodating, now i know why i've been taking all three kids here since they opened!"
"this place seems to be a hit or miss... i will not be taking my chances here. i decided to try it since i started working in the area... it's clean, the female that cut my hair was nice but if you're inexperienced, you might want to practice some more before being on your own. i gave one star for the cleanliness and one star for the friendly staff. so at first the cut is going well. then she asks for advice from a more seasoned person. that is actually commendable and i appreciated the fact that she cared enough to ask for help. but... asking a few times during the cut? and then she apologized saying she just doesn't want anymore complaints.... uh oh.... one side of my fade/blend looks like it was half done... from a 1 on the clippers to an immediate 4 length. and the back of my hair... wow i don't think i have any hair in the back anymore... on the bright side, hair eventually grows back. i'm not the type to complain or cause a scene but just be warned, use caution when going here or anywhere for that matter when stylists are ""new""."
"this place used to be great. good stylists, quick service, great place. it has seriously gone from a 4+,5 to 1 establishment in about 6 months. i'm only here because i prepaid for 6 cuts and can't wait to be done so i never have to come back. the stylists are scary incompetent and the wait is forever. go anywhere else."
"the service and massage was great but i was disappointed with the haircut. i asked for a fade from a 2 and the barber strait up just buzzed my sides. i have paid much much less for a haircut where the barber meticulously faded my hair to create an even distinct gradient. the barber didn't ruin my hair, it just looks no better than it did when i walked in."
"one and done with this location. hair cut by blake. friendly, professional guy, but what an uneven cut. my cut was pretty simple - #7 on sides and back, half inch off the top to spike it.didn't really notice the uneven top or uneven sideburns (left side is 1/2 inch longer than right) until i got home. definitely not worth the $22 + tip that i paid for it."
not a great barber shop. the buisness seems legit but the barbers there are not that good. i advise you to go somewhere else
"came here thinking they knew how to cut men's hair. i told them, use a half low fade into a 1, some one named raylene butchered my hair.. took me 4 months to grow it to the length of the style i wanted, she cut it to a faux hawk... has no idea what she's doing, guys: go to a barber, avoid this place at all cost!i only selected a star because i had to in order to get this review in"
"i went to sport clips, yesterday and yoli cut my hair.  there was no wait and i walked right in.  i was in and out in 30-minutes with a good haircut!"
always a great hair cut. desiree is awesome stylist.. takes lots of care and attention to detail.
"so i had a free mvp haircut coupon and tried this place out.  first, wait was really long.  for a chain style place they seem to take way to much time between customers.  second never trimmed around back of neck until i asked.  third was supposed to have mvp cut, but stylist left stuff  out.  didn't complain since i was getting a free cut.  doubt i'll be back? fantastic sams and supercuts are cheaper and quicker and probably more knowledgeable hair cutters"
"been here twice and both time my hair was cut by jie. she is completely professional and both times my hair was cut exactly how i wanted. she even remembered my first time coming in which was amazing. as for the place itself, really cool. plenty of seating for those waiting for a haircut and tvs all over the place showing la sports. i highly recommend the mvp cut. the massage and wash is a nice touch after a haircut. i will definitely be back again."
"another great cut. gotta go mvp, you deserve it! jie did my cut this time around and did a nice job. never been disappointed here."
"i gave this location 3 stars several months ago due to some poor experiences. i then deleted that review because i started seeing improvements with the haircuts over the past couple of months. unfortunately the poor experiences are starting to happen all over again. i paid $25 for a haircut that wasn't evenly cut, wasn't as short as i asked and just simply didn't go for the style i asked for (my hair was somewhat styled and they just had to clean it up and be done.) while the older woman was cutting my hair, instead of moving the clippers around as they're in use, the lady just drags the cord either across my face or around my neck. felt like she had no respect for me. she also didn't clean me after she was done and then sent me to the front counter and had someone else ring me up. i love sports clips - especially the chino hills location but this location is so back and forth, i'm gonna officially stop going here and take my business elsewhere."
"i came here ten minutes before they closed no a saturday night and they were welcoming and still took me in. i was the last one and was taken care of by jocelyn. from start to finish, i had a very comfortable and awesome experience.the place looked nice, sports was on tv, and the employees are skilled. i got the mvp experience. my haircut was amazing and the hair wash, massage was even better. she was also very knowledgeable on hair product and taught me a few things. overall, it was a great experience and i thoroughly enjoyed my time there. i will definitely be going back to a sportclips."
"jie has been cutting my hair for the past year. she really listens to what i want, unlike other stylists. i would highly recommended her service."
"i've been getting my hair cut here by jie for almost a year now and she is always very professional and friendly.  my haircuts are quick, but excellent.  i am always warmly greeted by her and enjoy my haircuts here because of her."
"as a busy mom, i don't always have time and forethought to schedule an appointment with my regular hairdresser. two weeks ago, i had to get the back of my hair cut-- and i needed it done like, right now. i picked up my 11 year old after school, we dropped in without an appointment, and 20 minutes later, i was as happy as a clam!thank you sports clips for taking great care of me!"
"this shop rocks, friendly staff. ask for the mvp. i've been to other locations for my hair but no one had the patience like this sport clips did."
i check in online when in the neighborhood. i always have my haircut by jie. with the online app i know when she's there and how soon she'll be available. she always does a great job.
"i have a haircut with jie who is nice , and professional hair stylist. so she can design hair style what you want ."
haven't been able to get to this location again as it's quite a bit of a ways to go from my house for the haircut. all i can do say that the service is great. prices are in good standing. they attend you with the smile. they are even better than supercuts is all i can say. go try them out if you need the smooth haircut for your interview look as your very stunning haircut counts for the job hunting.
awesome place to go to for men nd boys of any age.  get ur mvp experience it's like nothing uve experienced. great stylist waiting for you.
jie was soooo good. she gave me great input about how to care for my hair and gave me a great cut!
was looking for a new place to get my hair cut so figured i would try it out. asked for something simply and my hair was uneven. very disappointed especially for the price. will not be back. guess it is back to supercuts.
"i have been coming to this sports clips for years. after my favorite barber passed away in south pas. i just stumbled into this place and i am so glad i did. these guys get it right every time. they mix it up and change up styles and always impress. they are fun to talk to and the mvp service is the best service i have experienced in a hair parlor. after i moved out of the neighborhood, you would think that i would find a closer spot right? nope. i still come back to south pas sports clips! special shout out to victoria and jie! they are always the best!!"
just found this place it's awesome.  you get a little massage with your hair wash. and a great cut by friendly people. annie was great. if you like sports its all over the place.  go you won't be sorry.
"updated my review because of time and attentiveness of jon and jie.  :)today i came in to get my haircut from last week fixed (missed spots in back, side and front).  wrote an honest review of my recent experience and was responded to quickly, which i truly appreciate, and tells they value their customers!!!last week i came in during happy hour, so my mvp came down from $27 to $23; that was a  nice surprise.  she missed several spots and i didn't get the neck and shoulder massage, that's not a nice surprise.jie not only fixed up the areas around the side that were missed, as well as the spots on top that were missed, but also pointed out a spot in back i didn't see where there was a (not quite) bald spot where the stylist had gotten a little too close with the clippers.jie did a great job making it right!!!  victoria is my regular here (and no she is not the one who messed up).  i highly recommend either jie or victoria."
shout out to lina who was very patient and communicative when cutting my hair and gave very nice recommendations. my always go to stop for a no nonsense haircut!
been going here for a year now.  service always friendly and jie gives the best hair cuts.
"jie is the best! i've been coming here for over a year and have found jie to be outstanding at understanding my haircut needs (my hair is really hard to make look good, but she does) and delivering a consistent cut. i have had good experiences with the rest of the staff, too, but have found her to be the best at delivering what i'm looking for.kudos to the rest of the staff for being friendly, welcoming and keeping the place clean and inviting!"
"i've been coming here for years, and i have to say i've seen a significant improvement under the new ownership.mila has done a great job every time of remembering how i like my hair, and her great service will keep me coming back."
"i just needed a cut, and my regular barber had a huge line. so thought i'd stop in here.....mistake!!!i am an easy cut, usually 10 minutes tops in a barber chair. clippers, 3 on top, 2 on sides, 1 around the edges, square. very common casual cut.i was assigned to edna. when i told her ""3,2,1, tapered square"", she said what's that? then fumbled with different buzzer guards.when all was done, it wasn't a 3,2,1. it was a mess, an extra notch cut into front of my hairline,  and no discernible style.... just a little shorter.  when she said ""this was my first time with this"" i couldn't tell if she was kidding or confessing.avoiding in future!!  :-("
"i am 75 years old,  and i just got the very best haircut i have ever had in my life!   yevette was my stylist,  and i highly recommend her.   she is really skillful with a scissors cut, and my hair looks great! it goes wherei want it to go with a comb or with my fingers.   yevette usually works in the noho sport clips.  you can ask for her there.   since it was my first time, i got the mvp treatment. which included a shampoo, facial spa,  and shoulder massage.  these are all included in the mtw discount price before 3 pm."
they rarely cut hair evenly. the only reason i go every now and again is because it's fast and convenient
do not get mila! she did a great haircut but made my neck bleed like crazy! a pair of clippers are not meant to make a person bleed. she also played it off like it happens all the time and was no big deal. she continued to try and up-sell me on products and refused to give me a discount for my troubles. it's a haircut for goodness sake....
best experience of my life with delisa.  great haircut...and the hot and cold face towel massage is the best!you must go for the experience.
"under new ownership and management. great place to come for a good quality haircut at a reasonable price and you get to watch sports to! clean barbershop, friendly staff, don't forget to try the mvp upgrade! all of the stylist are wonderful and do amazing work!"
"i stopped by a local barber shop and was greeted only with ""do you have an appointment?"". well, no. i had a last minute break in my schedule, and just wanted a cut. i was subsequently turned away. soon after remembered seeing a sport clips here in encino. i stopped in. was greated immediately. i apologized for not having an appointment, but asked if i could be fit in. the barber gus told me there's no need for an appointment, and by all means he'd get me in. soon after i was in the chair, and gus went to work. gus did a fantastic job!  i hardly had to tell him how i liked it. once he got the gist, he knew what to do. that's rare. he offered me a special that included a package of cuts, and vip treatment including hot towel service, massage and shampoo. pleased with the service, and the package being reasonably priced, i bought it. i've returned since, and of course asked for my man gus. couldn't be happier!  great job!"
christine gave me a great cut. she is fast and does a good job. they texted me when it was my time and did not have to wait.
"if you go to sports clips encino, you need to go to gus, he is the best. i have been requesting to have him cut my hair for over 10 visits now and he is consistent and amazing.  gus is the man to go to!"
"imagine finding out you can watch sports and do a mundane monthly task like get a haircut. well this is the place.i have been going to this location for about 6 months now and there was a 50/50 chance i would have a terrible experience. from wacky hours to not having enough stylists on the floor. but i kept coming back because the quality and the environment was pleasant if i was actually able to get a haircut. so as normal today, i called ahead to check if they were even open, and was pleasantly surprised that they have new ownership and management.the lady on the phone was extremely polite and enthusiastic and made sure to inform me of new features (like their new online check in prior to arriving)  and the new store hours (happy to hear they are open everyday now and have longer hours).when i arrived i was expecting my usual of 10 minutes standing around till someone noticed me and was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by a very nice and enthusiastic employee who smiled and raised her hands out of excitement like as if we had just won the lottery. (definitely makes someone smile after dealing with the traffic of living in los angeles) haircut was amazing as always! very happy with the changes the store has introduced and wanted to post this review so people knew that there is new management and all those old bad reviews are irrelevant."
"came in on sunday morning. only two stylists working and waited over 30 minutes! staffing issues perhaps?once i sat down the stylist was pleasant enough and i liked my haircut. will try another location though next time perhaps unless i have a lot of time to kill, which is basically never."
my second time here and i will definitely go back for future haircuts. delisa helped me with my haircut. she patiently listened as i explained what i'm looking for. she did an excellent job cutting and styling my hair exactly as i wanted. i got a lot of compliments afterward! highly recommend this place.
best cut ever! you can really tell the difference with the new manager and owners- i love being greeted as soon as i walk in with my boys- this time i had my hair there too by delisa and i can't tell you how happy i am- no more long waits with hairdressers that think they're doing you a favor by cutting your hair- and the mvp is beyond the most relaxing part!! go there now!! and ask for delisa
"came here on a lazy friday off, and glad i did! i did have to wait about 10-15 minutes because there were only two stylists, but not a big deal to me.my stylist lily was great, asked me what i wanted and took her time with a great cut and mvp deal. i definitely didn't feel like i was being rushed through; she was friendly and consistently made sure i liked where the cut was going.on top of all that, the first-tiner discount is great!  highly recommend."
"this is my first visit to this location. i was pleased to find out they service men and women along with kid. i was greeted by the staff who were all very friendly and,helped me with the new check in system. i received one of the best haircuts i have ever received from the new shop manager delisa. her attention to detail was amazing and her personality is so easy going and friendly. i got the mvp upgrade and love the massage chair and the hot towel. the tea tree smells good and is very relaxing. i highly recommend this shop and be sure to ask for delisa but i am sure all of the stylist are just as nice! the shop is in a great location to."
mila gave me a great haircut and was very sweet.  it was my first time at sport clips and i'll definitely be coming back.
"the new owners have really turned this place around! i used to go,  but just wasn't impressed ever. i saw that there were new owners and decided to give it another try and delisa was great! we had a great experience,  great cut,  and i'm really happy they have made so many changes."
i can always expect a great haircut and great service at this location. i've been coming to this sport clips for almost 3 years now. always friendly and clean. met the new manager on my recent trip. she was extremely helpful and kind. i will definitely be back soon.
first of all the shop is really clean and is a great place fornthe whole family. i went in to get a cut and was pleasantly greeted by delisa and chrisine. i did not wait more than 5 minutes before delisa sat me for me for my hair cut. absolutely loved what she did. i havent stopped getting compliments! i sent my mother in and she feels the same way. definitely bringing back the kids as they are huge sports fans and so glad we have finally found a place that suits us all.
i took my son for a first day of school haircut. they were fast friendly and affordable.  haircut was 24.00 plus tip.  will be coming back for sure.
this is an awesome discovery. began taking both of my boys there and it's so easy. i log on and check them in. by the time i drive there it is their turn. no hassles...no craziness!!! love it!!
"great friendly staff...walked in and was able to just check in on the computer they have upfront.  came in on a sunday and they were able to see me in less than 15 minutes.  one thing to keep in mind-  they don't do any sort of shaves, which i was a bit disappointed about.  all the folks there seem pretty friendly and do a decent job of cutting hair."
"i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this experience.  it was only slightly more expensive than other haircuts, but the services provided are way better.  i'm surely going to do this again."
"what's not to love??i've been coming to this sport clips for a little over a year now, and its been a great experience. i had never been to sport clips before this one opened up, and i'm very glad it did.all my life i had been getting my haircut at supercuts, and i even tried a pricey salon once to get my 'do. but i discovered sport clips and i've never been back. the season pass is a wise investment. you get 6 mvp haircuts for the price of 5 mvp cuts. $125 for 6 haircuts, complete with a blissful steamed towel, a massaging shampoo, and a shoulder massage. it's a steal, and they even let you come back for a neck trim for free, without an appointment, between cuts. i've had my hair cut about 10 times here, and each time has been pleasant. the staff is friendly, and its a lot of fun to watch sports while you get your hair cut. in the summer you can even do a cool towel instead of steamed. they also know men's hair, and are great at adjusting to your precise detailed style. parking here is a breeze, oh and they take notes on your haircut and keep them on file so you can come back and stick to what worked."
"great place for a men's haircut.  as a first-timer, i got the vip service (free) including a trip to the body massage chair.  friendly atmosphere, reasonably priced and big screen tvs.  all that's missing is beer!"
"this is an awesome place! my son and husband come here a lot, so i can see how great their hair look afterwards! i really enjoy this place and would recommend it to anyone."
"took my 2 boys, ages 6 & 9. both joon & katherine were great!  since it was our first visit, they got the mvp treatment for free (which they absolutely loved!).  took one star off because they don't take appointments, but we checked in and then walked over to chipotle for dinner since the wait was about an hour. so if you plan accordingly, it's not that big of a deal."
hands down... best experience! amazing service! jessica is amazing! my 7 year old immediately got in the car and told me to yelp her and to give her 5 stars!!!
"i have several complaints about my experience at this sports clip, the fact is that the hair stylist did an awesome job! professional, clean, and perhaps the best. i am overly critical of my hair cut and have not really been satisfied with a hair cut until today's date. and for all the cons to sports clip, they got this one right. congrats on the 5 stars!!"
"the fact there's no real appointment system is pretty lame. they're all about their walk-in deal, however multiple times i have tried to come in after work and forced to wait 45 minutes plus because of this. pretty annoying if you're in a hurry or you value your time. the atmosphere is really nice but sadly i won't be coming back because of this."
"first time at sportclips la canada and after having my hair cut to perfection by jenn, i will absolutely, hands down, be coming back. jenn was fabulous. professional and down to earth, i was very pleased with her suggestions for styling my hair and how thorough she was. after experimenting​ with another sportclips franchise in south pasadena for many months but never quite up to standards, i am confident that i have finally found a barber in jenn who knows how to cut and style my hair, the way i want it. no hassle. great experience all around."
"what a waste, drove 25 minutes to get there and they would not honor me and my boys, three new customers no expiration free haircut coupons. said they no longer accept free haircut coupons.we will never go back!"
"terrible service!    today was a typical busy sunday but that does not excuse not taking customers in order.  when we came in no one was at the front counter, so we put our name on the clipboard that was left at the front counter.  after waiting almost thirty minutes they took two customers who came in after we did.  when i asked why, ethan tells me they came in before us.  i informed him he was mistaken and our name was on the clip board. apparently he didn't check the clip board when he came back to the from to counter and entered other customers into the computer before us.   this is a terrible way to run a business and a bad way to treat customers.  if you want to patronize this establishment, make sure they get your name off the clip board after you sign in.   it's unacceptable to make us wait for four people who came in after we did (a single customer and a family of three)."
"came in to get a quick fade. unlike some other chains, they're always able to run with all my requests that i would normally reserve for a barber. whether it's some sort or fade, taper disconnected undercut they can do it.another thing is that it was a good hair cut and fast. i recommend jessica and elle."
first time customer saw it during world series game. went to try it out and had a great experience. justin cut my hair and you can tell he knew what he was doing from start to end. i got a free mvp upgrade since it was my first which saves me $5 so that was cool. it was very relaxing and i will defienetly go back.
"i work in finance and need a ""business cut"" about once a month to make sure i look neat and well groomed. i used to live in south pasadena where my basic haircut used to cost $35 at a salon frequented by more women than men. having just moved to the lacanada area, i looked very carefully for a new place for a haircut. i had never heard of sportclips before so i decided to give it a try. on my first visit, i made sure my iphone had photos of me with the haircut i wanted. (i thought that having these photos would be better than thumbing through magazines of male hair models looking for the style i wanted because, well, i'm just not one of those handsome hair model dudes.).  my first haircut was with inez. she offered me the mvp treatment which i, unfortunately, had to decline because i was pressed for time. ""no worries,"" she said cheerfully and offered to note in their records that i could avail of the free mvp treatment on any future visit. i enjoyed the haircut and was quite satisfied with the results. i decided that sportclips could by my new go-to place for haircuts.   i just went back there the other day for my second haircut in as many months. this time around theresa gave me a haircut. the experience was terrific, the cut was perfect, and i left looking handsomer than i was before my haircut. at least that's what my wife and daughter told me when i got home.  in summary, the haircuts are great. the sports magazines and the sports channels on the numerous tv monitors are a bonus. the prices are reasonable. i look forward to all my future visits to this place."
i have come here 3-4 times and brought my two sons also. you really have to time it or you'll wait a while. but they do a good job and they staff are very pleasant.they always seem a bit rushed so come on off hours.audree and bibi are gems!
"this place is great. theresa is amazing, nice, and helpful, running an efficient location. clean, quick, and kind. thank you."
"customer service is awful. they don't care when you show up they take whoever they feel like. my son had been waiting for a haircut with me for 20 minutes, a bald man walks in (yes, bald men need haircuts too?) the woman at the counter says don't bother signing in i'll take you right now. this place offers a decent haircut for a kid but it comes at the price of dealing with people who don't care you're there."
"wanda was awesome! very helpful and knowledgeable on men's hair. i've been looking for someone that's good at there craft and she's got it down. thanks wanda, you rock. i will be back for sure!"
"one of the worst haircut experiences i've had. this is my third time here, and my last. i went in after already getting a buzz cut for the military because i needed some extra trimming attention around my ears. not only did they not offer a discounted price from a full haircut, but they made a big deal about asking. 3 coworkers in the store were involved in this conversation! i do give the person who cut my hair credit for giving me $5 off the full cut for being in the military, but asking for a 10/10 review kind of ruined that impression.i found the mvp treatment to be uncomfortable because the chair isn't very adjustable. there was a lot of pressure in my neck when i was laying my head back in the sink, and no amount of adjustment fixed that.definitely not a relaxing experience."
haircuts are good.  but!  i don't know why i have to enter all of my information in their screen every time i go in!  its especially annoying and really an invasion of privacy.  plus their computer is not easy to navigate and is frequently out of order.  if you do not enter your personal data you cannot get a haircut!i would give a higher rating if the streamlined their system!
"thanks for the recommendation to go to fantastic sam's on maxella!  by the way, very rude lady who refused service because she decided to close shop early (i arrived around 6:40pm when the closing time was 8).  she ended up saying fantastic sam's was open; glad they actually stick to their hours unlike this place, and service was so much better. last time i was here, this same lady was also very rude to her co-worker. it was clear she was the boss but i felt so bad!  one more thing, i dread coming here for haircuts. tools are dull and pulled out hair quite a few times.  a lot of room for improvement.  didn't want to leave a bad review bc i appreciate them being here as a last resort hair cut option for me, but the closing early... honestly just poor customer service and i want to give everyone the heads up not to make the same mistake i did."
"super rude large hispanic lady said her name was diane. went in there waited up front and tried to check in on ipad thing. she yells ""it doesn't work"" so i'm standing waiting to get my haircut and she says i have some one coming in. shes like next time you should call in. i just left."
"nice people, but they take forever.  i left my house on sunday at 11:15.  the place is 5 mins away so i arrived at 11:23 after parking.  just got home at 1:45 p.m.  unbelievable.  i would have rather given it a shot myself at home with my clippers."
"no exaggeration--worst haircut i've ever had. water and soap in my eyes during the ""wash"" and she said ""back to the chair"" without even drying my hair... had to ask for a towel to do it myself. and then the haircut you ask?! my dog could have done better with his claws. cuts all around my neck and it's completely uneven. don't go here."
"overpaid for a bad haircut.  asymmetric, and cut it way too short for my style in some spots yet weirdly left a lot of hair on top.  i've never had issues at other sport clips locations.  also, i think the clipper was dull/dirty because it was noisy and pulled on my hair sometimes. basically worst haircut ever. also, there's often only one person in here so the wait gets crazy.  trust me, it's not worth it."
just got done with a quick hair cut by agatha. she did a great job without any issues. i've had  pretty solid hair cuts from her as well as nazanin. i'm usually surprised that it's not busier. they don't hassle you here and expect you to get a hair wash like some other places.  plus they have big screen tv's with sports on it!  too bad no beer
"always a quick, great haircut. super close by which is anecdotal for me but makes it all the more convenient. the wait is rarely any more than 10 minutes and i've never had a bad haircut here in two years. i see nazanin typically on wed, she's amazing. definitely recommend."
"i like the vip , the cut,wash, massage is a great package. also i buy my shaping cream from you and it not only works great buy has a nice scent to it.diamond hooked up the cut.  i usually just go with whoever but now if she is there i would wait till she can take me.jason"
"i thought i'd try this new place out since a) it's near my office, and b) i've had a run of not so great cuts at my usual spot. plus they advertise as being sport-themed and having all the games on. i came in on a sat afternoon, taking one of the last spots on the ground level of the little parking lot (they have more spots underground). i've been to this shopping center before but never up to the 2nd floor so i had to look around a bit for the stairs--there's no signs. anyway, found them and went up. there were two customer in barber's chairs and one more who had walked in right before me, so not too crowded. i only waited a few minutes before being taken in. as a new customer, i was upgraded to the ""mvp"" package, which includes massage chair and shampoo and a neck massage on top of the haircut (a $5 value). all in all, got a decent cut, didn't take too long, and got to watch sports center all the while, for $20 plus tip. though i regretted not stopping in at costco beforehand--there's vouchers for free cuts on your first visit near the exit."
"when i walked into the shop the front desk person was sitting in the waiting area with her feet up. i was the only one there but still you'd think they'd at least anticipate business. i inquired about just getting the side of my head faded, nothing off the top, and they were going to charge me full price. i had a coupon but even with 5 dollars off it would have been more expensive than my usual barber (he charges $19.00 they wanted $24.00 post discount).the price isn't really her fault but when she told me that the hairstylist was in the back sleeping i turned tail and left. i'm not trying to have someone groggy go anywhere near my head with a blade. i don't know if they have a manager but if they do its obvious he/she isn't doing a great job."
"i gotta say that this place surprised me. i got a great cut at a great price! shout out to my girl nazcinin! she was awesome, even efficient, and i love my haircut!thanks :-) see you soon!"
got home to realize that my neck trim left a burn on my neck. guess the woman who cut my hair doesn't use clippers much. it's been a couple of days and it's still there. :-(
great haircut amazing service.  the staff was very friendly very clean location i would definitely return again
"i've tried to described what i want but the lady didn't seem to understand much english and i showed a photo and she said photos always help. i walked in with a long hair and was hoping to get out with short and decent hair. then she started cutting sides and they were so uneven. then she took me to hair wash and when i said aren't you going to cut the top part she said she is done. she was so rude during the whole time like pushing me around and stuff. i couldn't believe the whole thing and i just paid and left to make sure i don't walk out with a terrible hair. i've gone to a different place to finish my hair and they did a decent job. then i stopped by again and showed my hair and said this is what i wanted and she acted like she had no idea what's going on. she said ""did you style your hair and came back to show me how awesome it looks?"". i seriously couldn't believe the whole thing. i've put a complaint and a manager contacted me. i thought she'll offer a refund as they didn't do anything but she said she's sorry and she'll give me a free hair cut next time i go there. so our plan is to wait couple months until my hair grows so i can go there again to risk everything. i don't know if this was a one off stylist as when i went back the rest of the crew was super nice to me. but if you don't like taking risks on your hair, i'd suggest staying away from this place."
"can i give negative 5 stars??? do not go here. do not let ""navinine"" cut your hair! my poor son had the worst haircut of his life today. they must recruit dropouts or pay minimum wage because a simple kids haircut for a cooperative little guy turned out to be a complete nightmare. her hand shakes and she has zero skills as a hair stylist. she even has a tattoo of scissors on her arm ... so maybe in her younger years she used to be able to actually cut hair. stay far away!!!"
"diane has been cutting my hair for over a year now and i have been going to this sport clips location since i moved to marina del rey two years ago (i used to frequent the sport clips in burbank). what's not to like? there are barbers who are familiar with cutting guys hair, short waits, extra clean space, free parking, and shampoo/hot towel/massage (pro tip: get the mvp). added bonus for their call-ahead service and season pass plan. diane is consistent and quick and great to catch up with."
"the haircuts feel rushed and they end up looking rushed. it wasn't until i left this last time that i noticed a whole portion of my head hadn't been cut. decided i was not going to go back to have them fix it because more often than not i end up fixing my haircut from here with my own clippers at home anyways. my haircut is a simple buzz cut with two sizes and blended from the sides to the top, this should not be as difficult as they are making it look. the store is clean and overall service is decent, the only thing lacking is the quality of the haircuts."
"ask for elizabeth, she is a professional barber who takes great care with every haircut. i've been going to her for 2 years now and wouldn't imagine going to anyone else. she just recently transferred to this location from riveredge. i am willing to drive the extra 20 minutes to get a haircut from her"
"i have ha good hair cuts here. gary great. mickey great. nef. terrible. no idea how to cut men's hair. can't use clippers. uneven. missed areas. just terrible. if nef is on ask for someone else and look at the job she does on the people. try to no laugh out loud at them. they will be irregular, poorly faded, i give nef no stars. it's a shame she is there otherwise i would give 4-5 stars. remember if nef is working. avoid her or do go in on that day. you will regret it."
"sign outside said ""no wait"", go inside and nobody waiting but myself after signing in. one person cutting hair. waited an hour and had to leave as i am a human with responsibilities."
"just moved to nj from il and was looking for a haircut, found sport clips which was familiar to me and it was great, been growing my hair out for a year and wanted a new look.  jackie was great with some ideas and gave me a new look that i loved and got many compliments with. found a long time customer!"
"passed the location for a couple of years but always went to supercuts because that's what i always did. we were at a store near yours and decided to walk in. everyone was very friendly, the wait was minimal, my haircut was excellent and i will go to supercuts no more. you now have a loyal customer. the promotion for a first time customer was also a great plus!"
worst haircut i've ever had in my life and that's saying a lot considering i've experienced some pretty bad haircuts. do your hair a favor and avoid this place at all cost! the free haircut they offer to new customers is not worth it! i can tell the person cutting my hair was a rookie she had absolutely no idea what she was doing it was so bad i had to tell her to just stop cutting it. i cut it myself when i arrived home and somehow i managed to do a better job than them! i have no knowledge of cutting hair. that's just sad.
"friendly staff! no appointment needed! great hair cut, we'll be back :) great price (first cut free due to coupon, woohoo)"
"place went way down hill since paige left. had to leave and go to clean cut down the street. if you're an adult - go to clean cut. not only is it $7 cheaper, they're real barbers. sports clips is rookies who are learning."
"haircut was fine, but the price information is inaccurate. this is the most expensive haircut i've ever had, and i wish that the listing had shown that information, as it's hard to justify paying this much for the haircut i'm getting."
"i had my hair cut from heather and she did a good work. will be back for sure.edit :not worth it, have to pay $21 or more to get a hair cut. also every time there is different hair stylist and hair cut looks different."
"service was good and friendly.  however, after the first bad haircut i got there i decided to give them another chance.  no such luck.  another bad haircut.fool me once, shame on you.  fool me twice..."
best place to get a hair cut the manager heather is awesome been cutting my hair for 5 years great atmosphere tvs at every station with espn playing massage chairs to relax and the mvp package is worth every dollar
"this place is wonderful. after going the first 21 years of my life only receiving haircuts at home and then eventually done by myself, i decided to get a haircut at a professional hair cutter. i am so glad i decided to. if you are on the fence about going here, definitely give it a try. heather and sophie are both phenomenal hair cutters and people!!"
"both times i've been here, a great experience is an understatement. between the hairstylists engaging in conversation about work experiences and life, and the mvp experience was great. stylists know how to massage the scalp rather then just lathering shampoo. i'll definitely be back and recommend others to try!"
sports clips is my new friend. they know just how to treat a customer and you cant beat the mvp deal
"very attentive staff, especially heather.  go for the double or triple mvp.  very relaxing."
a few years ago i would have laughed at the idea of going to a chain for a hair cut but boy was i wrong. now years later this is my one and only go to. this is a great place for a great haircut. all of the girls are very friendly and very professional and they all know what they're doing. i've even tried other sports clips but none of them compare to the wyckoff store. i wish i was better at remembering names because there are a few girls that are definitely stand outs but they're all great so it doesn't really matter....regardless if they're all soulless evil people ;)
"i've been to the wyckoff sports clips three times and had a decent enough haircut each time for a fair price. the service is terrible, though. as others have said here, it takes forever even when they're not busy and the owner or manager (not sure which, but he's been there every time) is so rude i just don't want to give them my business. supercuts in waldwick does just as good a job for a comparable price and they're much more efficient and friendly."
"deceptive hours of operation...advertize as open until 8pm, but arrived at 745 with no one waiting and was told they were closed. very rude customer service to boot."
my boyfriend got his haircut here and was hesitant at first but figured he would give it a shot. well he loved it! the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is truly all about sports! he loved the haircut he was given and said he would definitely come back!
"best place for men & boys to get their haircuts!!! the staff is amazing and there seems to be no turnover of stylists! try the mvp service, it's very relaxing - you'll absolutely love sport clips wyckoff!"
"the first time i came here was a few years ago, when they first opened up. i decided to check it out because i had a free coupon. big mistake. they didn't know how to do a skin fade. but for a free haircut, i couldn't really complain. today i decided to subject myself to another bad experience, for some unknown reason. today's ""barber"" also did not know what a skin was. she took 5 minutes to discuss with another employee about what she should do. finally she decided to go with a zero and left me with a deep line on the side of my head, and asked ""how's that?"" after i realized she was actually being serious, i said ""can you fade it now?"" to which she responded with a frustrated sigh. i also told her i wanted to leave the top of my hair longer. to which she responded by continuing to cut off the top, saying ""i'm just evening it out."" i came home and looked in the mirror, and i look like quasimodo. good thing i declined the ""free mvp upgrade"" offer. god knows what she would have done to me during a ""massage""."
"brother and fiancé love getting their haircuts here. very busy, but worth the wait. stylists are great! sports everywhere. get the mvp!!"
"i've been bringing my kids there for years, shannon is great! the place is always clean and my boys always leave looking great!"
"so i get there shortly before 6pm to get a no. 1 which takes no more then 5 minutes and the owner tells me that their cut off for walk-ins is 5:30. well, then don't post that you are open until 6pm. when i told him that its not a smart business decision he got in my face (literally) and called me profanities. one of the girls had to come out and stop him otherwise he may have hit me. needless to say i am not going back there. the last two times i went there, i didn't think it was that great and you find better deals at other chain haircut places anyway."
eh...the franchise idea is great.  tv's and sports stuff everywhere. service is painfully slow. the hair cutting staff (all young girls) are energetic and friendly. but they tend to yak with one another while there are 6 people waiting for haircuts. brought my son and waited more than 40 minutes.  there were 2 or 3 chairs open several times while the girls socialized. steve the owner is there often and nice but he is constantly training the girls while people are waiting making it take longer than necessary.  get it together guys.
"been here 3 times.  there is often a wait and doesn't seem to be staffed enough.  for a place that caters to men with a sports theme, there sure are a lot of kids and i've been stuck behind waiting for them to get done 2 or 3 at a time.  i doubt i'll go back again."
"donna was great! this was my first time at sportsclips, i'm a barber / owner myself and had a great conversation with donna, not to mention she did exceptionally well giving me a fresh bald head! i got a free mvp service because it was my first time."
the stylists know what they're doing! most stylists are personable. i always get the haircut i ask for.
fast & convenient haircut. friendly environment.
"i've been coming to sports clips for almost two years. the only stylist i will allow to cut my hair is alyssa! she remembers my style, our last conversations and is always has a smile on her face!  thank you alyssa!!!"
great staff and facilities are new and clean.  tvs everywhere.  only place i like to get my hair cut.
got a haircut from alyssa. very curt and rough moving my head. it felt like i was doing her a favor. time to upgrade somewhere else.
"melissa is the best hair stylist/barber, bar none. she is passionate about her work and is extremely detail oriented. melissa listens to you and factors in your features and hair growth pattern to give you a cut that perfectly frames your face. without a doubt, she will give you the freshest cut you've ever had - every time!fyi, i stopped going to the edgewater sports clips over a year ago. between the same sports updates blaring over and over, the cheesy gear and the gimmicky theme, they're lucky i tried them 3x (back when they 1st opened). although i appreciate not missing the game while getting a haircut, all the stylists seemed bored to be there and subsequently gave terrible haircuts, so i wrote the place off. however, i came back because i heard melissa left super cuts in fort lee and was now at the edgewater sports clips. i'm told they have a completely new staff equal to melissa's caliber, so if you tried it before, give sports clips another shot."
alyssa is awesome! she makes a serious effort in making sure you get what you're asking for. best hair stylist i've ever come across.
"avoid this place if you want a good haircut! out of the 4 hair cuts i've gotten here they've either been less-than-satisfactory or worse. today i got a haircut there and i noticed the lady ran the razor too deep in the back/side. got a nice little bald spot. and this isn't the first time! a few months ago a different older lady cutting my hair left it with like 3 or 4 little razor slips/bald spots on the side of my head. unbelievable. are the employees even trained to cut hair or are they just careless? oh, and the way the employees forcibly greet you and everybody who enters is so cheesy, monotoned, and robotic. leaves you feeling awkward ""welcome to sportsclips""....i blame management and the business, no offense to the employees. either way, never going to sportclips again and i advise no one else too either. i was too nice to give this place my hard earned money after the first bad haircut. it's unprofessional, low quality service, and just bad. find a real barber/salon!"
"this review is not for sports clips in general but their stylist jen - i actually liked the atmosphere, the tvs, and all since it was my first time coming there.unfortunately, i had some grandma that said she can do what i ask to cut my hair. wrong.i told her i want a low fade and she wants to tell me i have a high fade.i told her to trim the top, half an inch, she cuts off like 3 inches. i specifically told her that i like my hair curly and to the back and now my hair isn't long enough to be curly and she combs it to the front or something.i would love to come back but she pissed me off too much. if you go here, make sure you ask for anyone but jen."
"this rating is a reflection of their customer service, particularly the managerial staff.i received 2 coupons for a free haircut at a promotional event. i planned to use them for my children. prior to my visit, i called to see if they cut girls hair, and i was told they do, but they do not do blow outs. fine, not a problem.when we arrived, we were immediately greeted by the assistant manager. i showed her the coupons prior to the haircuts, and she acknowledged them without a problem.my son was taken first, without waiting, by a lovely woman. a few minutes later, my daughter was taken by the assistant manager. as the assistant manager was walking, the manager quietly said something to her, that i could not here.once the haircuts were done, i went to settle the bill with the assistant manager. it was then that she told me there was an add on fee ""for length"" that was not included in the coupon. the manager came over when i began to question why this was not told to me prior to the haircut. i asked if the coupon states anything about add ons not being covered - it does not. i asked it there are any signs posted about add ons on their walls on the price list - there was not. i explained that that is a very poor business practice to slap on fees that are not posted after providing a service. the manager would not budge on the fee, and stated that she said something about it prior to the haircut. i told her that she did not speak to me prior to the cut, she spoke to the staff member. her response was, ""but you watched me speak to her"". so she assumed that i heard her conversation with someone else, instead of speaking directly to me.all in all my son loved his hair cut, and my daughters was a simple trim. the place was clean, but after the experience with the manager, i would not return."
"great experience and haircut. get to watch sports and a top notch, very detailed, haircut service. complete with shampoo and scalp/neck massage! 10 out of 10!"
"so far, my visits have been awesome. i usually do my cuts with paula or chloe, two very good and awesome ladies (highly recommend). i always do the mvp, and they certainly love what they do. i don't think i've seen anyone not in a good mood there....did i mention they are very accommodating with my work schedule?? even though it's a chain, they make you feel like it's a mom & pops barbershop. definitely recommended!!"
"usually quick to get me into a chair and quick to get me out, with very little chit-chat, and consistent results."
"it's just a lot of fun  getting a haircut/style while watching your favorite sporting event on wide hd screens like a sports bar.  a fade and the world cup 2014...service was very friendly, and the stylist and manager (same person) gave me exactly what i requested. this is my new spot! sports bar meets hair salon (without food and drink) love the spin on it! oh yeah, the chair they use to wash your hair is also a massage chair!! i recommend their vip package. a+"
"i just came back from getting a hair cut at this location and it was the single worst experience i have ever had in professionalism and customer service. i have been to another sportsclips and had an excellent experience. at the original sportsclip i was told that my haircut preference would be kept on file so that if i went to any other sportsclip my information would be in the system. when i entered the edgewater location i was told that they do not keep information on file here. i said fine -- no biggie-- i will just explain how i would like it. there  was no one in the waiting area when i got there, and 2 others in chairs being serviced. after waiting forty minutes for the woman to give the man in front of me a short trim  i was ready to get my haircut. but three other people walked in and were serviced before me!!!! when i pointed out that i had been there almost an hour waiting for a haircut after i had been told my wait time would be 10 minutes the man in charge apologized and said the customers who walked in had stopped by earlier and left because of the wait time so they deserved to go first. wth?? finally, after over an hour of waiting for a buzz cut it was my turn. the woman cutting my hair had no idea what she was doing. i now look like a lego man because she did not fade my hair --- she attempted to make it all the same length. unfortunately she was so awful that she missed areas and it is an incredibly uneven haircut. when i walked into my home, before i could even explain my experience to my girlfriend, she remarks ""that haircut is awful -- tell me you did not pay money for that!""never go to this location!! be warned this is a pricey place for an awful haircut and an even worse experience."
"we brought our son here for his first real hair cut and it was such a great experience. we had two lovely women helping keep him distracted and entertained while he got his trim. he was upset at first, but they calmed him down quickly and were so good with him (and his nervous mother). luckily, there is enough going on with tvs and hair dryers, etc., that he didn't seem to bother the other guests when he was fussing at first - but the staff was obviously keeping him happy for more than just our benefit.  it was all around great customer service.  and his hair cut came out great even though he's young and small and wasn't exactly sitting still.  the salon is also very bright, clean, and true to the sports theme.  can't say enough about how happy we were with our visit."
quick convenient and inexpensive! great with kids. good location and lots of parking.
"wanted to try a new place for my haircut and have seen ads for this place for awhile now. just got back about 30 mins ago from my appointment and i wanted to make sure i shared my experience. first, the online check-in is a must! this saved me so much time, by the time i got there i was 2nd on line, the place was packed and saved me so much waiting time.my stylist was ella, she was very friendly, and professional, worked with me to find my proper number and to make sure i was satisfied with everything she did, she also walked me through every step to make me feel more comfortable. because it was my first time, i got my hair cut, hot towel, shampoo, and neck and back massage for a great value price of $20! i will definitely be back again, a great experience and a great hair cut!"
people that cut your hair there thinks they are doing you a favor ! my wife brought my son there to cut his hair they waited 45 minutes and the lady remember him not sitting on his chair she gave excuses not to cut his hair ! if you didn't wanted cut his hair you should of said so from the beginning.not make the customer wait 45 minutes and give excuses that it's not safe and stuff very bad staff and rude !! never will go back again !!
"octavia was great with my son. however, i would suggest against this business if your children are autistic or have other disabilities. the online checkin helps with my son because he can get overwhelmed in large groups. once we checked in he was first in line. 2 people were taken ahead of him and one person wasn't even asked if they were next, they just walked into the cutters seat. like i said octavia is the only name i know because she helped my son out, the other 2 were very unprofessional and poor examples of whatever policy the corporation has."
"christina is awesome, her haircuts are one point and she's got a great sense of humor. prices are fair and little wait time, not sure about the sports viewing as we never wait long enough to catch a game. ask for chris or christina!"
go to cristina! she's amazing!!! mvp is a nice addition with the massage and hair shampoo. there's usually no wait and the checkin process is via self-check-in.
"stopped by here because i have an interview on monday so i needed a trim and my usual guy is on vacation. upon walking in i was pleasantly surprised at the layout.  the space is very clean (the location is only 4 months old)large screen tv's are everywhere and it felt a bit overdone with the sports theme.  granted i'm not a sports guy so take that as you may.  i was here for a haircut.you don't need an appointment as it's walk-ins only.  this again was good news.  i was paired up with a young lady named dani.  she was exceedingly friendly and although i'm not a talker she tried very hard to make conversation.  upon entering the chair she asked me what do i want to have done today.  i replied a trim.  now here's where i think things went very wrong.  my thought is this:  if someone walks in and asks for a trim they are essentially asking for the barber to remove hair in proportion to maintain the overall appearance of the current hairstyle.  i was alone in this thought as i soon found out.she asked my for my number referring to the shaving adapter size.  most guys may know this information but i did not.   it was clear by her nonverbal feedback that i should have this information.  we decided to learn together and tried a size 3 first. only she had it on 3.5.  then we went to size 3, then finally agreed on size 2. so she went to work buzzing away. i'm not trying to be picky but i could tell by how rough she was and her overall technique that this wasn't going to end well.  then came a brief haircut.  the haircut i received was unbelievably bad.  she masked the butchery she committed on the back of my head by hold the mirror at angle that i couldn't see how uneven the back was. she left enough water on my hair so that i couldn't see how uneven the front was.  the final insult came as she was taking off the gown and dumped all my hair back onto me.  then she took a hairdryer and blew what she could off. totally backwards. klutz.i left knowing that i wouldn't be back ever, but i had no idea how bad it was until i got homeso bad i can only post pictures.  for 18 bucks you should be able to provide a decent haircut.  bottom line : i'm not coming back here ever again but if you get your hair buzzed on all sides then this might work for you.  but so would a flowbee.  if you do go here i think its a roll of the dice at best.  avoid dani.zero stars."
"was skeptical initially to change my barber, but gave a try and loved my haircut. ask for christy! that sweetheart knows what you want. interior is nice, the process of checkin in convenient!will come back!"
"about 2 weeks ago i went into sport clips and met julia who, quite frankly, gave me the best haircut i can remember.i mean absolutely perfect. i had a barber that is no longer able to cut hair that i went to for over 12 years; for the past two years i've been struggling to find someone who can cut my hair in the way which i want it. perhaps it's my fault for not explaining what i want but until now i've not been happy with any cut that i have gotten.julia broke that cycle and did an absolutely fantastic job, she's an absolute asset to your company and i can't thank her enough."
happened to go in by chance the staff was friendly the store was clean the wait time was a bit long could definitely use online reservation system i'll definitely give it another chance the haircut was decent
"first time to this store. not busy. very clean. stylist elizabeth was amazing. great conversation. talked about all products she used. and why she used them. if i'm back in this area, i will definitely go back."
amazing staff that will make you feel right at home while providing a flawless professional service.  these stylists really know what they are doing!!
"got a hair cut from angela this morning and could not be happier - fantastic service, excellent cut, everything was amazing!  if you are looking for a great cut at a reasonable price, look no further!"
for the first time in a very long time i got a haircut i i'm very satisfied with. i showed alyssa a picture of what i wanted and she gave me exactly that. it's low maintenance and stylish. will be back here for sure!
"please go to angela, she is the best with men's fade cuts. for 15 years i been getting fades and never allowed a women to do it until i found angela. she is really good at her craft and does a great job."
"great atmosphere, excellent service and great haircuts. the price isn't bad either (they offer coupons/discounts/birthday-extras). convenient with hours, clean, and cool with the tvs. i also highly recommend the mvp, it's free with the haircut for first time clients. its so relaxing, not only did you get a great cut, afterwards you receive a relaxing scalp massage shampoo with a hot steamed towel while sitting a leather massaging chair, then the stylist dries&cleans you up followed with a neck&shoulder massage finish. which the stylist discusses products best for your hair and plan next visit. overall a great experience when you just need to relax for 20-30 of your day!"
"my barber retired after 25 some odd years, so where do you find someone that is willing to cut whatever it is i have left on the top of my dome. i'm not fancy by any stretch of the imagination when it comes to hairstyle, i'm just thankful i have something to cut. it is true that they need to get their act together in some respect of customer interaction, but the people i've dealt with there have been nothing but friendly. i sat down there for the first time telling the stylist that i had no idea what the barber did and she was willing to work with me and without any type of attitude. there were other people in there at the time that were giving another stylist a really hard time to the point where i started to feel bad. however, when you have 10 kids running around a joint without proper parental supervision, i'd be cranky and want to stab someone in the eye and or neck with a pointed implement."
tried this place for the 1st time yesterday after a bad experience with city looks down the road. wait time was reasonable - 10 minutes. although it was a slow time in middle of week day afternoon. katie was my hair cutter and understood exactly what i wanted.  she handled scissors expertly and cleaned up my last bad haircut. came out just the right length and even. that's all i ask for. good job.
"i have taken my son to many barbers in cranford, union, and garwood over the past 13 years and every time, the barbers would cut it incorrectly, there were always stray long hairs, or it would look terrible after waiting up to an hour.we finally found someone that cuts his hair perfectly every time. i think this was his 5th haircut with norma. norma, at sport clips in the garwood plaza is the best! i think we waited a half hour once, but who cares; she's worth the wait.i almost don't want to write the review in fear of not being able to get an appointment!  norma takes her time and even took notes as to how my son likes his hair. norma even recommended his cut last time. norma is awesome! this is the only place i will take my son from now on!thank you norma!ps. do not let her go pete"
i have been to several sport clips and this is the worst one yet.  the cut itself was okay not great but my hair is pretty easy. my issue is that the stylist bruised my neck pretty bad with the clipper.  to make matters worse she played tricks with the mirror on the back of my neck to avoid me seeing the marks. it wasn't until i got home when i saw the damage.  it was bad and sore.  i called them the next day to discuss my dissatisfaction.  the person i spoke to took my name and number down and said the owner would call me.  this never happened.   i'm just glad i didn't take my son there.  we don't be back.
"we like this place because of the ease of having my son's hair cut- no appointment necessary, and the stylists always do a good job. we have never waited more than 5 minutes. the staff even takes notes as to how my son likes his hair. it is one of the less-pricey places as well and the staff are very friendly. we also like that you get 50% after 6 haircuts."
"my 8 year old son had a great experience with our new stylist. i forgot her name, but she has dark hair and has two kids-such a nice woman (i'll up date when i find her biz card). she was friendly (but not fake and over the top friendly), patient and was very skilled. she gave my son the mvp treatment--meaning after his hair cut, he was given a nice warm towel over his face, a gentle head and back massage. it's refreshing to find a genuine, not so in-your-face stylist who doesn't rush cutting when dealing with kids. he loved being treated like a big kid. and his hair looks so awesome. all of our friends and family keep complimenting his new 'do. so happy we finally have to place to continuously bring (the male side of) family.  seriously now, i don't have need to be a hair salon slut anymore--i think we found the right place and stylist for male haircuts!"
"haircuts here are consistently of high quality. i have never been disappointed. if i wanted an alteration afterward for my personal preference, they happily accommodated my request."
"the good: i want to like this place, i really do!  for the second sunday in a span of two months i've taken my 5 year old for a cut at sports clips garwood.  the atmosphere is great for a 5 year old boy, especially on a sunday with football.  unfortunately that's about where the positive reviews end.  the not so good:we've had ""ok"" haircuts here.  if you have children unfortunately if you don't stand over the stylist she will likely not cut the way you asked her to prior to beginning the cut.this is the most painful part of the experience, the staff is insanely, insanely slow.  no one greets you when you walk in, you just need to know that you have to place your name on a sign up sheet at the desk.  it literally takes about 45-50 minutes for the staff to get through one customer, clean the station and prep for the next customer on the list.  many times customers/parents will pay for the ""mvp"" which only prolongs the process.  one of the two stylists then disappears for about 5-10 minutes in between each cut only exacerbating the situation.  in the 8-10 times i've been to sports clips garwood (both on the weekends and during the week) i've never once seen the owner.customer feedback:my advice to the owner is to spend a sunday at your establishment and reevaluate your staff.  you may also want to add another stylist on weekends.  currently you need it, but if you continue down this path you won't soon enough.my children and i won't be returning.  you've lost a customer and positive word of mouth within my social media circle."
"my son and i have been going there since it opened. he always went to jess but she doesnt work there anymore. my son had a signature mowhawk that was his good luck charm for basketball and football, until nicole shaved it off. nicole greeted us, went over his haircut, lengths of razor clips, how he styles it and how long the top should be. then, sat him down and shaved it off. when i got upset over it, nicole told him ""all the kids wear it like this now"". well, the cool thing was that he didnt want to be the other kids. hair grows back, its not the end of the world, but running a business is about listening to the client. if you go, explain what you want and keep an eye on them."
"friendly, talented staff, haircut done in a timely manor w/attention to detail, clean store, & treated like an mvp."
"cristina is an amazing barber! she's extremely attentive and easy to talk to.  i like my hair a specific way and she will make sure to take her time and get every detail correct.  this is within a complex off of route 17 (next to the tesla dealership) and has lots of parking.  easy to get off and on 17, and there's a pizza restaurant next door."
"this is my second visit to a sports clips (i've been to the one in oakland where my haircut felt a bit rushed and sloppy) so i was hoping that this experience would be a bit better.when i came in, i was immediately greeted by one of the barbers/stylists. they were super friendly and welcoming and directed me to the tablet in front of me to register. i didn't mind doing this but i could see how it could be annoying if you didn't want to give them your information.i was walked along to one of the empty chairs on the right side where a soccer match was on. on my previous visit, i was asked if there were anything specific i wanted to watch but not this time (not a big issue but it would've been nice). even though the place was less than half full, the cut did feel a bit rushed. they upgraded me to the mvp treatment for free (hair wash, machine massage, chair massage) but i think that if offered it again, i'd decline it. my barber got shampoo in my ears and didn't dry my hair well. she also didn't wipe my face right away after getting some hair near my mouth (i had to request it). the barber was really nice but she left a few split ends and the cut was slightly uneven. i'm not sure if it's just a coincidence or maybe the people working at all sports clips are unhappy about the job (i wouldn't want to massage people either) but each time i've gone to one i felt like i should've gone to supercuts instead or even the salon school."
great place for a cut. they have specials so be on the lookout for that. it's a true hidden gem. all the stylists are top notch.
"checked in online for my 2 sons- 2pm. sportclips website states 104min wait & suggests arrival of 3:44pm. while i had never been to sportclips, i knew it was in vicinity of paramus park. we head over to mall to pass the long wait before our ""appointment."" around 3:35, i call sport clips and inquire, ""on my way over, what landmark on rt. 17 n are you near?"" and ""i'm coming from paramus park, are you north or south of the mall?"" sports clips states, ""south"". she furthers, ""we're in vitamin shoppe strip mall just south of paramus park."" so, i head onto 17s and start looking on the n side for the place where i will be making a u-turn. drive all the way down past gsp and realize the girl was wrong, this place can't be south of the mall, because i'm no longer even in paramus. what i am in, in terrible parking lot-like traffic on good friday. i head north and kill the next 20 minutes in hardly moving traffic, looking for this place, only to find it eventually just north of paramus park, right where i was when i phoned the store and was told to drive south! i finally head in at 4:02pm. there are 2 stylists, each in the middle of a haircut, and an electronic board on the wall with 2 names waiting. neither were the names of my kids. a stylist looks at me and asks me to check in at the kiosk. i then explain that i've already checked in 2 hours ago, and i'm surprised i don't see my kids names on the board. i show her my cell phone screenshot which says arrival of 3:44pm. she says ""just check in again here."" i do so, and the store kiosk states 56 minutes!!!!! i exclaim,""you're not going to make me wait another hour siting here are you?"" ""are we at least going to be next?"" she states, ""well, if you don't get here within 30 minutes of your suggested time, the system removes you from the queue."" i state, ""but it hasn't been 30 minutes. it's only 4:02! why is my name no longer on the board?"" she has no answer. so, again i ask, ""if i wait here, will we be next?"" she says ""yes."" i also explained that i had recently called, and had she known the difference between north and south, i would have taken 17n in the first place and arrived in plenty of time for my 3:44 appointment! i now wait another 15 minutes for one of the 2 stylists to finish the client she's working on, and then she approaches the reception area and takes another person before us! absolutely amazing! just the stupidest employees and worst customer service i've ever experienced. i will never frequent this nor any sports clips ever again!!! this store wasted a full 2 hours of my family's time on a holiday and never even apologized for their mistake! they didn't even offer to cut the children's hair for free or anything for their mistakes! i had to leave without getting the haircuts, as we had another obligation. the stylist wanted us to sit and wait another full hour after already waiting 2 before we walked in, and killing 20 minutes in rt17 traffic because she didn't know the direction of her own store. totally outrageous! oh, and the best part, the sign outside the door the whole time said ""0 minute wait!"" don't ever go here unless you feel like wasting your entire day, or have not a single thing in the world to do for the next 4 hours!"
"great team here, very friendly and welcoming !  they offer a really professional service but still make you feel right at home!"
"came in for a clean cut and beard trim. not a bad wait, as a walk in with only 2 guys ahead of me. got marty and i must say, he is the man. speedy and professional clean shave and shaped up the beard. went with the mvp treatment with a hot towel on the massage chair, then shampoo, followed by a cold towel. nice experience and will definitely be back"
"the hair cuts were average at best, but last i week had what was arguably the worst haircut i've ever had. i am pretty sure i may have been one her first clients- ever..i would like to keep coming back, but i won't be back until i hear the talent has gotten better."
seriously?! who taught you how to cut hair?! this is how you cut around ears? you remove an inch and a half of hair? picture speaks a thousand words. save your money & aggravation. go somewhere else.
best haircuts in town. service is also great and everybody is really nice in there. 5/5
"good value for your money, only slightly more $ than supercuts.  my hairstylist emily was excellent and did a very thorough and complete job.  i got the mvp which includes the cut, hot towel, shoulder and scalp massage.  everyone there was very friendly, if you have a coupon, definitely go in july!"
nikki was wonderful with the cut and the gesture.the place is clean and the staff is very professional and courteous.definitely recommend
"what a joke online check in is.  scheduled myself well in advance and arrived at the time i was instructed , to then find out i had another 20 minute wait.  the worst part is that had i walked in without the online reservation, my wait time would have been less.why bother with an online system that creates a crappier customer experience?  sports clips should consider providing a discount if they are not able to meet the expectation of the service they provide."
"entire staff is friendly and helpful. i went in not expecting much, but got the best haircut of my life by kimberly. you have a customer for life. thank you! highly recommended."
my son had the best haircut ever here.  nicci cut his hair and it was perfect.
i have been taking my 2 kids here for over a year. we miss lauren. bria has been doing cuts for last 2 months and does a great job and very friendly
3 out of 4 haircuts were bad... this last time they were watching the news instead of espn or sports. i'll be going to warren's sports clips from now on.
i brought my 15 year old son here for a haircut. my son doesn't usually like to get his hair cut but he loved the cool atmosphere and more importantly he left with a great haircut! we will definitely be back.
"consistently good haircuts, consistently great (and friendly) service. highly recommend."
"clean, neat, organized, attentive and skilled staff, just opened in december. great haircut for men of all ages and looks. made to be like a sports lounge/locker room with lots of sports and tvs. discounts and deals for kids, senior citizens and first-time customers. you can come in between haircuts for a neck and sideburn trim/touch-up for free. my hair stylist, patrice, was excellent. it's the best haircut i've had in a long time. i would highly recommend."
"worst haircut ever. waited for 15 minutes which was fine. but the woman who cut my hair needs to go back to school. the ""line up"" they offer is barely a shapeup. not happy."
got back for a free hair cut for my son with the manager and i am very happy with it. glad i gave them a second chance. will be back again.
"no appointment necessary.  professional, and reasonable prices.  go for the mvp with hot towel and scalp/shoulder massage."
bringing my boyfriend he loves the pretty hair cutters the sports tvs and the decent pricing
unorganized and unprepared. sunday and the only option that is open. two people on staff as barber and no receptionist. a room full of potential clients waiting patiently but with no information. after waiting a half hour and only one client turnover i had to walk out. if they had more people on staff they might be able to gain clients.
"not many hair cutters can pull off a decent flat top, but sidney is an exception and this review is about her.  for a young lady with not many years of experience she does an exceptional job.  she is pleasant and very knowledgable about her craft.  if you want a real treat, upgrade your visit to an mvp and enjoy the treatment she provides."
"the experience is always pleasant and i have never had a bad haircut from any of the stylist. i was just recently at the wall, nj store and maria did an excellent job. i really didn't have to say much and she was very efficient with her work. i am pretty picky on how i like my hair cut because my mother always was a perfectionist. thank you for your excellent service."
"at a very reasonable cost, and with no appointment necessary, i got a great haircut! i am extremely particular about my hair and usually get very nervous when in the chair, but i walked out with a cut as good as any posh salon-with out dropping $60+ thank you gabby!"
"well i tried again, and another service fail.  i walked in, and everyone was busy so i signed in. after sitting for a while, one of the stylists finished and was at the register when two people walked in.  apparently, she did not check the sign in sheet and entered the two new people into the computer. after a half hour, the person after me was called in next, and i had say that they missed my name.  exact thing happened on my last trip.  their procedures stink, and i hate having to always correct the order.  guess i need to find a new place."
great place to get a boy's buzz cut. my son has autism and haircuts have always been a challenge for him with his sensory and communication issues. the ladies here have been awesome with him and he's now completely comfortable and at ease getting it done with them.
service was excellent and coupon for free cut was very welcomed.
"everything. haircut was awesome, along with the massage. thanks emily!"
"this hair shop is only for men and the hairdressers are obviously well versed in men's cuts! my son got the best cut ever here! he is very happy with it as am i! i had to suffer through football playing on all the flat screen tvs in the reception area and at each station! but sports fans will just love this place! there are different packages you can select (including a neck massage) and the prices are good.   i also signed up to get email coupons. great, friendly service - hands down - new place for my sons cuts!!!!"
this place is the worst!!!!!!!   i would really like to know if everyone there are actually licensed.  they did a terrible job on my grandsons hair.  it looked chopped like a child did it themselves. not only did she know she did a bad job she was rude and went in the back room and left it to another person to deal with.  i had to go somewhere else to try and fix it. the only thing left that could be done was buzz cut which i specifically did not want done and told her that from the very beginning   i will be notifying the better business bureau
good place for a fast cut!  employees are nice and the mvp is a nice touch! i recommend melinda!

"treated my father to a glow-up here yesterday. stephanie did an excellent job cleaning him up. you could tell she knew what she was doing and she asked a lot of questions to make sure that she was giving him the style that he wanted. the staff was very friendly, we were greeted right away and seen immediately. she made sure to give him some coupons for his next visit before we left."
"been a loyal customer for almost 2 years now. i go back because of the sports, the conversation, and the customer service. come here asap."
"worst haircut i've ever had. i would go back to parris island for 13 weeks for a haircut before i'd go back to sports clips.  the room is too dark to see how good they do, or in my case i missed how poorly it was cut.  since it was my first time there it came with everything including the shampoo and massage. the shampoo is the best part of a hair cut everywhere except here. the water was scalding hot, she tested how hot it was on my head instead of her hand. i tried reaching out to them and didn't hear back. i took their survey and never heard back. i sent them the pictures and nothing. it was just a terrible hair cut."
"did not listen to what i wanted.  specifically said, ""do not cut the front, i like the length.""  this was the last thing i said to her before she started.  she then proceeded to cut over an inch off the front of my hair, which forced me to completely change my hairstyle.  she wasn't even close to what i asked."
"i hate (b/c i dislike most sports and am a woman) this place but my son gets great cuts from this chain overall (one cut was too short and butchered at the deptford, nj, location . . . so much so that i told the woman at check out that i didn't want to pay . . . and i didn't! - only left a small tip for his hairdresser.)after a nice lunch at pasta pomodoro, i suggested an overdue haircut (trim!) for my son, aidan.  we went in and fortunately got crystal for his hairdresser.  i pre-cursor'd his cut with the above and she was careful to leave the top of his hair long.  she did a great job and my son loved/s the cut.  (he's not smiling in this pix b/c this was the 2nd shot i took b/c he blinked the first time ;)    aidan asked that we go back to crystal ""next time!"""
"i have been going to sports clips for years.  this location i have been going to since they opened.  last time i tried to go there i arrived at 10:05 and waited 15 minutes before i went up and tried the door and it was still locked.  the open sign was off as well. i even went as far to go onto the website and let them know that this happened.  i have had zero response from the store or from the organization.  you expect to be paid for your service, and as a customer i expect you to be open during the stated hours.  from now on i will go to the location in voorhees as the woman that owns this locations and the one i mt laurel will never get my business again"
"this place is a prime example of entitled hair stylist. the business opens at 10 am. i showed up at 12pm. there were 2 stylist working. the first one pulled me back and i said i wanted a ""0"" on the sides... she said i don't know how to do that. so i said, ok i'll wait for the other stylist. while i'm siting down i hear her say ""omg, i haven't eaten yet i need a break or i won't make it until 2pm"" what the hell... you're working 4 hours and you're stressing????? cutting guys hair???so when she found out that i basically had to go to this other stylist since i couldn't get a 0 on the sides from the other. she rushes my hair cut, didn't talk a word the whole time, and when it came to payment i didn't leave a tip, and she stated ""no tip, my day just got worse"" tips are for hark working employees not 4 hour shift brats. by the way her name was sam. stay away from her. laura is the one that doesn't know how to do a ""0""... you know the lowest setting on a buzzer. unbelievable"
"never tried this place but my experience was wonderful.  as a first timer i got the mvp at a discounted price!  wonderful.  i got an excellent haircut, beard trim and then in the ""showers"" a wash of my hair and massage.  i will return, this is my new spot...all for a reasonable price of$30 including tip!  i am a fan.  and all the time you can watch sports on tv...what's not to love.plenty of seating in the shop.  my only complaint is that check-in system is a bit confusing so have them help you the first time.  it is not user friendly, they need to change the screen to ""welcome sign in here."""
"my regular haircut spot since i moved to the area. i have been to several sports clips and this is my favorite location. the ladies are always friendly and professional and they do a good job keeping the line moving at a busy location. sunday is a madhouse so if you ain't there when the door opens just skip it. the business model they have is good, i like that they store how i get my hair cut, the wash and head massage is well worth $5, and they give a discount to police, fire, and service members. my only knock is the stupid overly complicated checkout system. it was slow before due to whatever brand card machine they use and now they added a computer pad interface to slow the process down. also you have to give your zip code to check in, why do you need personal info to check in? the new computers also fish for your email address which i absolutely hate."
"extremely disappointed with my experience here. brittany cut my hair and to say she was all over the place is an understatement. told her i didn't want much off the top, she started off fine then started blending. she used the clippers and went halfway up the top of my head on one side so i no longer have a part. she complained about how tired she was while singing to ""stay awake"" and just kept chopping. this haircut is one of the worse ones i've had and i am extremely disappointed with her service.  i wish i would not have spent the money on this haircut. i could have done a better job blindfolded."
"i have been coming here ever since they opened this location. i almost always get a good haircut. the girls always seem friendly. getting a haircut used to seem like a chore, now i feel like its a treat. the triple play is my go to service. the hot facial towel or even the cold towel during the summer is always so relaxing. i enjoy the green tea products they use as well. i even got my father hooked on coming here as well. keep up thr good work sports clips!"
"used to love going here. they never had crazy waits. i went twice in the past week during school hours and there was an hour+ wait. i called the 2nd time to see if my name could be signed in as i was on my way, and was rudely told ""we don't do that"". no sorry no attempts to provide any alternative. have to find a new haircut place now..."
"they do a good job with my son's haircuts, but can be a little more friendlier and price for a 12yo is a bit high. when i tipped her extra on the card she didnt even acknowledge the tip. a simple acknowledgement would suffice. i had to ask her if she saw it.  tipping is optional not expected!here's the bigger problem: please fix the sound system. the tvs are all on the same channel (which is fine) and it echos throughout the shop. add some surround sound and mute the tvs. headache city over here. rant over!"
"first of all, not all men like ""watching"" sports. it is a waste of time watching someone else enjoying themselves. so, when i visited the shop with a friend, i didn't care for the sports channels blasting the latest scores. that being said, the place is just a regular barbershop with the same bells and whistles as other shops. nothing special."
look for a girl named marisa! she cuts hair really well! i would definitely recommend going here! also i would go during the weekday around brunch. it's empty. plus the staff is really nice and very welcoming.
"the girls are great here. they offer good service and a very friendly attitude. my haircut is not always perfect, but everything else is always a good experience. i would recommend the mvp. once you get an mvp its hard to go back to normal haircuts. it is funny to say but i come here because i like everything else about the mvp, getting massaged, shampoos and the friendly atmosphere more than the haircut itself! lol."
"worst experience ever in a sports clips. came from atlanta first time in a sports clips here in nj and they didn't offer the mvp for being first time customer. cut my hair way to short, never coming here again. don't go here!"
sports clips is on my way home from work. i have not been too happy with my haircuts i've received my first two times there. yesterday i needed a haircut for a meeting the following day so i figured i'd give it one last shot.....a stylist named shelby cut my hair. best haircut i've had in a long time. shelby did an amazing job and couldn't have been more friendly. had a great experience and thanks to shelby i will continue to be a customer as long as she works there! thank you shelby!
"they don't take appointments, but that actually worked well for me and my husband.  we went in and only had one guy ahead of us while all three girls were working on other men.  we only had to wait about 10 minutes, but by that time, about 5 more guys came in and added their names to the list.  my husband had dana who did a great job on his hair!  he was probably with her for about 15 minutes and i really appreciated that dana asked me for my feedback since my husband's last haircut (not at sports clips) was horrendous.  we'll definitely be back!"
"went back again last night and again a great haircut.  michelle was great again, very friendly and nice.  pleasure to get my haircut there.definitely my new place.to get a haircut."
cool concept but agree that this is super cuts in disguise.  would have preferred a quality cut rather than the hot towel face wrap and shoulder massage.
"just got back from getting my ears lowered here. i'm very happy with the way my hair looks and i would definitely recommend going here. i 100% agree with vlad.the shop is sports themed (a dead give away by the name) and you're meant to feel like you're in a team's locker room. your first time you get the mvp treatment for the price of a regular haircut (cut, shampoo with head and back massage and hot towel). you'll also leave with a discount card so that on every other haircut, you save a bit of dough.also found out, neck and sideburn trims, in between haircuts, are complimentary.haircut pricing:$22 for the mvp treatment$20 for varsity treatment$17 for regular cut$14 for junior varsity (boy's cut)check it out."
"had a very bad haircut here. they butchered it! as for the supposed sports concept, i didn't feel it was distinguished from any other place."
"where else can you get a cut quickly, while watching sports?where else can you get a cut accompanied by a hot towel treatment while sitting in a massage chair, while getting a head massage?where else all of this costs around $20?definitely worth the while!"
"first time ever trying a sportsclips and i was blown away and kicking myself as to why i've never tried a sportsclips! great cut exactly what i had asked for, and then much to my surprise they don't just give you a rinse but rather you lean back in a massage chair while you get a full blown shampoo, head massage and a warm towel on your face. just when i thought i was done we went back to the chair, she took out a massage gun and i recieved a neck and back massage!  leave in conditioner was applied too. all the while having the option to watch sports the entire time. was truly pleased with their employee and concept. will definitely be returning. all of just described cost $24 but i was charged $19 for a first time customer."
"accompanied my boyfriend during his haircut and his stylist did an amazing job. i love his cut, suits him well, and he told me she was very personable too."
my two boys (jr. and high school) don't ever love getting their hair cut but they really like coming to sport clips. i do too and my wife always comments on how good a hair cut we all get. the stylist are all very nice and i've never had a wait issue - i've been at least 10 - 12 times now. i get the mvp which includes wash/shampoo/hot towel on face and shoulder massage. it's a good value - check them out!
"great place! they saw me five minutes before closing and made my day. morgan was friendly, efficient and provided an excellent cut. i was impressed with her skill.  will be back for sure!"
"all of the stylists are very nice and make sure the haircut is what you want. they don't take appointments, only walk-in. when we initially arrived there were only two or three people in chairs, so we were able to sit down for a cut immediately. it did fill up pretty quickly, but they have a tv screen that informs you of wait times and how many people are ahead of you. first-time customers get the mvp package (hot steamed towel, massaging shampoo, and neck massage) for free! cool and clean environment with plenty of up-front seating for waiting customers or friends!"
i booked an 11am appointment with a stylist. online booking confirmed her availability time. i sat and waited for 20min before leaving. she was only halfway done with her current haircut when i left. nothing worse than having your time wasted. don't go here. i love the keepitcut on 28th and indian school.
"my husband went here to get his haircut last week and it was terrible! i was eating lunch next door and when he met me after his haircut i seriously couldn't believe what a horrible job they did, it seriously looked like a little kid cut his hair, it was uneven all over and had long patches! i made him go back in there and have them fix it, they tried to fix it but still failed miserably. do not go here!!!"
we used the free haircut coupon we got in the mail for my 5 year old. i will be going back to v's barbershop this week to have it cleaned up from the haircut he got here.
my first time here was a great experience. the stylist did a great job! she knew just how to cut my hair for my head shape. i will never go to another budget hair cut place. sport clips is well worth the extra few bucks!
"sports clips a came ravingly recommended and i was pleased with the service i received from the moment i walked through the door.  it is noteworthy that they(owner) spent time discussing what i was trying to accomplish and made some excellent suggestions. the waiting lobby has the amenities, flat screens etc.    my stylist name was desiree, i highly recommend her.  she takes her craft very seriously and the discussion was informative and thorough as to how best to work with my hair and why, i always asks why.  she expertly answered every question.  i opted for the full treatment as this was my first time i wanted to see all the salon had to offer.  so i got a haircut, shampoo, foot massage.  i wish they knew how to give a hot towel razor shave, then they would be perfect. the strongest testament of the desiree skill as a stylist, was all the compliments i received at church the following sunday.  i highly recommend this desiree at sportclips."
i love this place. i only come to this location because of chelsea. she has been cutting my hair for years now and she's the best.
"great place! i've tried 5 different places to get my haircut this year. i've paid over 50 bux and under 20 bux trying to find the right place. this place is perfect - they're inexpensive, quick and provide a quality haircut (shampoo, steam towel, etc). also tons of tv's always showing sports. you can walk in any time!"
a friendly place with a pleasant staff.  i am always pleased with my haircut from misty!
"horrible haircut place, used to come here regularly until this mickey roarke looking tool by the name of chris ruined it for me when i showed him a reference picture to cut my hair and then despite this he still rudely refused to do it based off of the picture he asked how much i wanted off the sides and top. well that's why i brought a reference picture you idiot. he was clearly pissed off that i had come in 30 minutes before close, so by being rude and outright uncooperative he attempted to get back at me. i did like this place due to a few of the hair cutters but now i know that those people are few and far in between, most of them are just like this guy who don't give an f about you, just looking to make a quick buck. as i was writing this review the guy tried being nice to gain my respect back but sorry buddy being fake is just making it worse. never going here again, from. now on going to salons where the people can actually use a reference photo lol. this place is the mcdonald's of haircut places."
"i was in town for work and needed a haircut for a big meeting.  walked right in and was greeted by laura.  she ended up being the hair stylist that cut my hair as well. she is awesome , professional and very friendly. if i end up coming back into town i will definitely try to swing by. she was extremely polite and her customer service was unmatched.  my haircut was done so well.  she did it effortlessly which was very natural and impressive.5 star laura!-rick"
"always pleased with all the ladies at this location, but i can't help but single out laura.  not only does she make my hair look great,  she is so incredibly warm and friendly.  often when i come in there is a wait for her.  she is a very talented stylist,  and my hope is that the owner and management appreciate her incredible work ethic. again, the whole team is awesome, but i feel laura goes above and beyond."
"had an enjoyable experience here with the amazing nina. she perfected the haircut i was looking for (& i was trying something different), and was actually great company to have around. well worth the extra few dollars to go there!"
"i have passed other sports clips for about 7 years now to come to this location.   i used to exclusively have angela cut my hair, but have discovered other talented stylists there if angela is gone.   the hot towel and scalp massage is something i always look forward to.  everyone is always very friendly and i walk out with a good haircut.   every.  time."
awesome customer service. brought my 3 year old son in and got a great haircut from erika. was great at explaining what she was doing . will definitely be back!
awesome service. in and out. complimentary water bottles. watch sports. hot towels. hair wash. massage chairs. will be returning
at sport clip waited for 45 to 1 hr. the service was useless. they call it precision hair cut. for me it wasn't true at all. they miss so many places that i had to go home and ask my brother to cut the missing places that was sticking out. the hair stylist shampoo my hair when washing my hair the water seeped in my shirt and got my top shirt wet. i felt for the price i paid for the mvp package. i didn't get the mvp service. i hope someone in sports clips reads this and makes improvements.
"i haven't been to this sport clips location in a while, only because i am closer to the chandler location. i happened to be in the area grabbing a coffee and took my son to the new place across the street called keep it cut. i must have gotten a new or inexperienced stylist, because my son's cut was horrible - it looked like a toupee! i immediately took him to this sport clips to see if they could fix his hair. i was so relieved that the stylist he saw was able to save the day and make it look nice. she even gave me a discount because she felt bad for us - such great customer service. it's nice to see the quality of service remains unchanged. thank you sport clips!"
"went here today as hair was annoying me lol, and we have this chain in my home area, so walked in and had a girl take me in right away, gina if i remember her nae right was very friendly and good at what she did, and i got the mvp here and was very impressed with this cut, next time im in the phoenix area and need a haircut, i would probably go to this location."
great place to get a hair cut and bears trim! audrey did a perfect job with my weird styled hair do and was extremely friendly. this is officially the place that cuts my hair an beard from here on out.
"i feel like it's hit or miss with this place. sometimes i've gone and gotten a great haircut, other times it has been a disaster. i always get my hair cut the exact same way, so i don't understand why it's so difficult sometimes. the last time i went here, they did such an awful job (and it literally looks nothing like what i asked for) that i'm going to be finding somewhere else to go from now on. i can't style my hair at all because of how terribly it was cut, so now i just have to wait until it grows out so i can have it cut again somewhere else. if you're okay with taking the chance of having to wear a hat for the next 3 or so months, then this place is for you."
"i have come in here more times than i can remember now. so they must be doing something right. i come in for a quick haircut at a low price. i always get a coupon, because, they send them out in the mail, which is good.the place is clean, and you do not need an appt.i always like the job they do. but, if you do not have a coupon or it is on special it could be a little higher than i like to pay."
"i know what most people think about a place like this, it's a chain and you're never going to get a good, precise, haircut. that couldn't be farther from the truth, i always walk out with a great haircut. the waiting area is clean and the staff polite and really care about what you want. i come here about once a month and always leave satisfied."
"the waiting room was freezing! that's my only real comment. i was waiting for my boyfriend while he got his haircut. he said he liked the hair stylist. she did a good job on his hair and told him about a product that could help soften his facial hair. he was interested. i know their customer is more a male demographic so it wasn't really a place i would go without my boyfriend or a male relative. i wasn't in love with their uniforms. it seemed like every girl was dressed different and they looked unorganized. it didn't seem great for branding and consistency, like normal chain establishments. i'm sure my boyfriend will return, i just happened to be with him and he was looking a bit too scruffy so i tagged along on his haircut."
"it pains me to write a negative review - i always get the most expensive haircut here, and then always leave a big tip, and i liked them - been coming here for years. then they switched from paper based reward system to computer (good), and they asked me for my cards to put on the computer last time i was in (good), but then none of my six ""stars"" made it to the online system.sp...i stopped in once, and they promised they'd check into it and call back. nothing. i called and left a message, and was promised they'd look into it and call back. nothing. i emailed them and waited for a reply. nothing. its just a shame - to treat, and lose, a customer over something so easily fixed as a free haircut (six ""rewards stars"")."
"run away and don't buy the season pass.i had a solid 3 okay cuts so i bought the pass and just got the worse cut of my life. i am literally driving to a salon to get it fixed now.there is no training here. the people are nice but ""forgetting"" what they are doing half way through and messing up the cut with a razor is not excusable."
"just moved to tempe from gilbert and walked into this place a month or so ago because i needed a quick haircut.  there was a heavy wait but i was ok with it as i knew it was a last minute thing at 7pm.  i was finally called upon and laura introduced herself and she was great from the get go, not only was she the best at conversing, but the hair cut was darn good too.  i left extremely happy and i am glad i waited.  i found myself a month later (today) needing a haircut and decided to go back and low and behold the lovely girl who cut my hair last time was at the front to greet me.  i asked for her again and she got me in fairly quick, i was impressed she remembered just about everything we talked about the first time and the conversation was just as good if not better, laura makes the haircut enjoyable and i highly recommend her and this place, everyone there is super friendly."
"i used to come here often. today was my last time, however. after coming and bring told i would have a ""10-15 minute wait"" i sat waiting for an hour.  when i told them to take my name off of the wait list because i no longer had time, the response was just a shrug and ""ok"". they didn't even ask what my name was so they could take it off. ridiculous and unprofessional. looking for a new place now"
everyone is always friendly. ive been numerous times now and never gotten a bad haircut. very convenient to get food next door while you wait also
"way overpriced for a haircut joint. i had a coupon for $10 which is about all a haircut is worth here. the extra $7 gets your head shampooed and a hot towel on your face. since this place touts that they have female stylist's, i might as well comment that jessica looked good in her tights (but she has a bf) and did maintain a conversation for most of the trim. i don't think either girl cutting hair was over 22 years old and that is just not enough experience in my book. she never heard of the word tapered before. this is another chain that expanded too fast."
"i took my husband to get his haircut here, and it was great! we walked in and got in right away. the lady did very well, and it was quick and easy. the prices are a little high for a simple cut in my opinion but it is cheaper then going to a high end salon."
"i went on their website on a sunday and did an online checkin, and there was a 0 minute wait. i got to the salon probably 2 minutes later and my name wasn't in the wait list and i had 2 people in front of me. i figured they just deleted me and added my name again and sat down fast forward 20 or 30 minutes and this kid comes in and says that he did an online check-in as well but his name wasn't on the list. they told him they'd push him to the front of the line which pissed me off because the same thing happened to me. when we expressed that all i got was an ""oh sorry about that""to top it off there were 3 people working and one took probably 30 minutes to do a child's haircut, and then another stylist had to come help fix it further delaying everyone else. eventually i had to go because i had a 1 pm meeting. i waited from 1205 to 1250 and got no where which is pretty ridiculous. this isnt the first time i have gone to this location and had issues so apparently it's pretty horribly managed. i never thought i'd have to boycott something as simple as a haircut place but i can't stand having my time wasted."
went in and was ignored. stood by register for 5 min with no one asking me if i needed anything.waited a while longer and finally gave up and went to great clips where they were happy to have my business.
the staff is extremely rude and unprofessional. i will never be going back. you can find much better service somewhere else. don't waste your time.
"levi loved his haircut and massage he got today.  the hairdresser had a fantastic attitude, so friendly and nice.   very outgoing.  solange was the gal that did his hair.  thanks for making my lil man so happy!!!"
"if it weren't for solange the new girl we would not be posting positive feedback but first of all, i want to give props to solange for her great personality and going above and beyond with her work. unfortunately, we can't say the same about her other two co-workers, one a so called manager name jessica and a allison; they were extremely disrespectful with us and with her new fellow co-worker when she simply asked a question. how unsupportive of their part and overall rude. i don't understand how someone can be given a title of a ""manager"" and they don't act like one.thanks again, solange for being so nice to us and we really appreciated your awesome personality! many blessings to you!all stars for solange and none for the others."
"used to come here all the time for what is a very basic haircut. after 3 months of growing my hair out i set out for a quick cut before work, and was told my wait would be no longer than 15 minutes, but i sat around waiting for about 25-30. i sat down and the manager asked if she could take a before and after picture of my haircut for their facebook page. now here is the crazy part, i was sat in a chair with a hair stylist i had never seen or met before and literally within 2 minutes i was being told by her that her female manager had been sexually harassing her over the past month by ""touching her a**"". the stylist informed me that even though she has asked the manager to stop, she still went out of her way to  touch her. then, with my jaw on the floor both because of the content of the story but also because of the fact i was a customer who only came in to get my damn hair cut and was being told a horrific story, the stylist began telling me how she was raped before working here and it efected her life greatly. this whole time the manager and other stylist were in the back and could not hear the conversation.  the stylist was rushing around with my hair, forgetting what she was doing while explaining to me in detail how and when her manager has touched her and was finished within 10 minutes with the cut. i got my hair washed then, as the stylist told me how she was hoping that someone would come and take care of the rapists in the world because it is simply not okay to make someone uncomfortable to come into work. at this point all i am thinking is, ""i hope to god that this haircut is at least decent after this terrible experience"". it wasn't. off to the styling chair for some gel and the stylist keeps noticing parts of my hair that she had missed and is cutting them while rubbing gel in, and the manager comes out again. she asks to take the after picture, during which the stylist is trying to covertly tell me not to take the picture and i shouldn't trust her. she took the picture and while doing so was finding pieces of my hair that will need to be cut and cutting them while i stand with a stupid grin on my face, visibly sweating because of the stress going on within my head. no other customers were in the store. i honest to god have never been so frighteningly uncomfortable in my life.two days later now and tried to call another store to get the information for the owner of the mesa riverview store, but of course no one can give me that contact information. tried both monday and tuesday to reach the corporate office by phone in texas, but was never put through to as much as a voicemail. i am astounded by the sheer level of incompetence displayed by the owners of the franchise, the corporation itself and the employees at this sports clips.my only suggestions can be to fire everyone in that place, get someone that is not a fucking customer for your employees to go to when they feel sexually assaulted, and to never ever go to this place. and on the last note, their facebook had no pictures of customers ever in their history expect for corporate stock gimmick photos so i am forced to speculate at what happened to the pictures of me that are floating out in someone's hands."
this was my go to place for haircuts they lost one of their best stylists and now the location runs slow and sluggish and no one seems to be in a hurry to help people with 4+ people waiting for a haircut
"the actual hair cut was great. the new check in system is flat out terrible. customers now check in on a computer, which is fine, and your name and wait time is then posted on a tv in the waiting area. my wait time was 11 minutes, and i ended waiting an extra 30 minutes past the initial 11 minutes for my haircut. the place was not busy at all, 2 people were finishing hair cuts as i walked in. the employees were having a great time making conversation, texting, and not working with any sense of urgency. if it was busy or there were a lot of people waiting i would understand, but it was not busy at all! very frustrating experience."
"i've been in search of a great barber shop for some time.  i've tried almost every shop with 4 stars or above, and still, never found a truly great haircut.  where my search logic was flawed was in that i was hyper-focused on price.yes, sport clips' full-service cut is more than i would normally want to spend.yes, it was worth it!a truly custom experience.  easily, the cleanest salon i've ever been a customer at. they ask the right questions, they listen to you, and they're not finished until you are satisfied.  stop looking, guys. this is your barber shop."
"i felt it was time to update my previous review... props are due for jessica too. just like tierra, she's confident and knows what she is doing. if one isn't there, i can just sit in the others chair. they both know what i like and are very professional. thanks tierra and jes!"
"been coming here 4 years and know 4 girls who work sara,davina,misty and jess. jess usually cuts my hair. all 4 girls are lovely there nice to the customers and there co workers a great crew at sport clips. but there's a new girl named solange she's very 2 faced i come to this location all the time she's nice at first but very rude after u know her. she's very rude to all of her co workers. i give the 4 girls all 5 stars but solange don't get 1 star in my personal opinion. if she worked for me would have got rid of her by now let's see how long till another review is up bought this new girl"
"yep, left there because apparently talking with people for more than 5 minutes after the haircut is done is more important than the one individual sitting in the place waiting to get their hair cut. went over to great clips and being called up for my clip now. learn something sports clips."
this place has a woman with black dreads working there who is completely intolerant of children. my littlest was checking out the merchandise to keep busy and wasn't doing any harm. no spillage or anything. our regular place where we go to get my husband's hair cut knows when my son messes up the shelf i put everything back nice and neat before we leave. it keeps him busy and prevents screaming and tantrums out of boredom waiting for his dad to finish with the stylist. we've even bought product from his little discoveries of shampoo and gel. went to this place for the first time because we were all tired and in a hurry to get my husband's hair cut. never again. got treated with hostility by a very annoyed black woman who acted in a huff as she rearranged the shelf. normally i'd put everything back for the salon but if she's going to act that way to paying customers and curious toddlers then by all means be rude to us and you can do the work yourself and we won't return. if she's the manager or owner it's no wonder the place was dead and lacked customers at one of the busiest times of the day for salons.
"i have been here a few times. the first time was a disaster as the girl rushed through as fast as she could and my hair was left lopsided. i called back later that day and asked to speak to a manager and they said that she was not available but that she could take a message and call me back. she never did. fortunately, i had a friend fix my hair but i was left with hair much to short for how i normally style it. after about a year i was in desperate need for a haircut for a funeral and couldn't get into my normal stylist in time so i sucked it up and went in again. i told the girl my concerns and explained very extensively how to cut my hair. this time this stylist did a wonderful job! she spent about 30-40 minutes cutting it and in the end it looked great! so, i recently had another situation where i needed a hair cut last minute and i went in for a trim. i was very disappointed again. the stylist this time was the same as before but she only spent about 5 minutes cutting my hair. she cut it all way to short and it was again lopsided. this was the worst cut i have ever had. i asked her to even it out especially on the sides were there was a noticeable difference. this proves to be a mistake and she ended up taking even more off of all of it and it was still lopsided. i voiced my disappointment and she seemed annoyed and eager to help the next person and practically booted me out of the chair. i called and talked to the ""manager on duty"" and she did apologize but said that they are pressured to do cuts as quickly as possible. (she also added that they are pressured to sell product.) i asked her how i am supposed to have my hair fixed and she offered to do it at no charge but that she couldn't do it the same day and that i would need to come back the next day. i had to go to work the next day so that was not an acceptable solution. fortunately for me, my sister-in-law was in town who does hair and she was able to fix it. she added that my hair was pretty bad and asked me if i tried to do it my self. no, i could probably do a better job. the service is to inconsistent and management doesn't seem to care about customer satisfaction. they are all about speed and they are overpriced. try somewhere else before you go here. not worth a months worth of bad hair."
"awesome place to get your hair cut.  close to tempe and mesa.   ask for audra, you won't be disappointed!"
we just had a great experience at the new sports clips. ashley handled my sweet and anxious 3 year old with tender care and gave him a pretty sharp cut. he is so excited. we will definitely be back.
i picked this place out for my bf to try because it was close by and had good reviews. he loved it!!! i am so happy we found somewhere he likes and that does a great haircut. we will definitely be regulars from now on.
"i am very impressed with this establishment. my last two haircuts were garbage so i thought i would give this place a try. i walked in, sat right down and was very happy with my haircut. i highly recommend sports clips to anyone in need of a good haircut. i got the ""mvp treatment"" and probably will every time i return. very happy."
had this lady named tesa. cut my hair in under ten minutes flat while pretended to be interested in my life. terrible hair cut. had to recut mine somewhere else. never going there again...
"i don't find sports all that particularly fascinating, even less so when i can't see without prescription glasses, but the haircut was great. i needed a haircut, why else would one stop in, and figured i'd give this location another try. on a previous visit, i didn't quite get the haircut i desired. upon examining my head closer at home - need to shower to wash off the always-there-after-haircut hair clippings - i noticed the unevenness on the sides and a general lopsidedness toward my right side. i proceeded to shave it all off and start fresh.i had found a decent barber outside of los angeles, ca, but didn't really want to drive 12 hours just for a haircut. as i am willing to try just about anything twice, i figured, as it had been quite some time since the last visit, that i could once again try sport clips. the establishment was on my way from the post office and it surely must have had new stylists working since the last debacle.upon entering, i was greeted and asked to check-in on their kiosk. the purported wait time was between 9-13 minutes, but as it's a haircut, it could easily take less or more - it didn't matter much either way, i had the time and needed the haircut. after about five minutes, if that, i was greeted by veronica and everything went smoothly from there.i really cannot say enough good things about veronica - she is quite attentive and seemed to actually care about how the hair was styled. she had questions and i deferred to her as she was the one that could see all around my head more easily. it's quite remarkable to find someone who concentrates on the task at hand, as opposed to many of whom have cut my hair and seem to be more interested in talking about personal lives that achieving a purpose. that's not to say she's impersonal, but i'm sure after describing my previous visit to sport clips, she was ensuring i would be more content this occasion or perhaps something else entirely. in either case, i no longer need to travel to california to have my hair cut... i just need to call ahead to ask if she is working or not.nothing but good things about veronica and this particular sport clips!"
"wow....how can it go from so consistent to so bad!just returned from a month long trip and needed this shaggy head trimmed. i get the same cut every time, however, like most of these places, i got a different stylist. everything was going fine and she was pleasant and nice. but when she turned me to face the mirror, damn! the front of my hair looked fine but the back part of my head looked like a little kid had gotten a hold of some scissors and simply cut a large swath of hair randomly off the top of my head! she basically made my hair look like i live in a wood shack in the appalachian mountains.but you can't fix it. i mean, i would have to buzz cut the whole thing! when i came home my wife said ""what the hell?"" and then my in laws snickered."
"this is a big chain like supercuts.i have had about 6 or 7 haircuts here.today my stylist arrived quick, before i finished signing in.what i wanted was a precision cut, quick!what i got was a precision cut, quick.my stylist was awesome, and well awarded. 10 years with sport clips. and hit a home run with my cut!!!!. not too pushy with the product upsell and super kind with a great cut. i'm back, see you in 3 weeks."
"i have gone to this sports clips on many occasions. i have always found the stylists to be friendly and polite. that is until last tuesday. i am a 67 year old male, and i went in to have my neck trimmed, as they offer a free neck trim if you need one in between haircuts. it had been three weeks to the day since my last haircut, but my sides were looking shaby after two weeks so i decided to go in. i encountered kelly, the manager. right away she stared going on how they couldn't do my sides and back and could only trim the neck. she was rude and with a snarky attitude said its been nearly a month since my haircut. i told her its been three weeks and if i needed a full blown haircut after three weeks it wasn't cut short enough in the first place. in any case she got side tracked with someone else and i decided i would rather walk out and not have to deal with her again. what a poor example of a manager. the owners should take notice. with so many options for an inexpensive haircut i will go elsewhere. frank in scottsdale"
olivia was absolutely fantastic. i have had my hair cut by her and other great stylists there. this one was one of my favs for sure tho! one of my favorites ever!!! she did so good and her head massage was like suppper long. i can tell she is always eager to please!!! give her a raise and give her a high five! sorry that i was going to other hair stylists and cheating on her! i will be back lol! my hair looks perfect and dang that massage was a 10! :)also... a long time ago i left a scathing review here but things are way different now. i appreciate either good service and will review accordingly or i will totally let everyone know how much you suck. i just appreciate nice people who care. this place rocks now! also i think the name was stevie. she did great and all my haircuts for the last year or so have been great! everyone here is a+ :)
"never been to sport clips, but have been wanting to go. went in, met lori, who was very nice and did a great job on my hair. i just moved here so to go to the same person for 6 years and get use to sitting down and having my stylist know what to do, didn't know how much i would have to say but she was on point and did a fantastic job! the mvp is worth it. i found my new regular place to go!"
"i've had two haircuts at this place, and neither one was bad, but if i'm going to a cheap place i'll just stick w/great clips since they're...well, cheaper (and quite honestly i think they do a better job...the one by my house does, anyway).quite frankly, i think the whole sports theme is a little gimmicky. when i go in to get a haircut i just want to get in & out (i have short hair so it doesn't take long to cut), so i can care less about a ""theme,"" tv's, etc... this place tries and promote it's ""extras"" in addition to just a haircut (wash/shampoo, a neck massage, and i think one or two other things). they call it the ""mvp."" eh. i mean, if you're into that and want to pay the five extra bucks, that's fine, but like i said, i just want my haircut and to be done. the two times i've had my haircut here, neither girl did a bad job, but they were no better than any other chain haircut place."
"i live in wyoming, michigan and go to sports clips i really like the atmosphere the people are so friendly and know how to cut hair i am 60 years old and have been to many hair shops in michigan i tried sports clips and believe me when i say they are the best place to go for the experience i will say it is one of a kind if you haven't tried them please you owe it to yourself to a treat they treat you like family"
"i was over due for a haircut so i stopped in at sport clips. it was a great experience; i had the mvp experience which included a haircut, neck and shoulder massage, shampoo and a hot towel. i look forward to returning for my next trim.rick the happy camper"
"olivia is the best always does a fantastic job, highly recommended!"
"if you're a guy, love sports and like to be pampered while getting a superb hair cut, then this is the place for you. the first thing i noticed was how intently i was listened to as far as what i wanted in a haircut. then there is the sports. they had the baseball channel on, which was fine, as i love baseball, but if you ask them to change the station so you can watch football or anything else, they are happy to oblige.hot towels for your face and even a neck and shoulder massage await you there, all free if you're a first timer.it only $4 more than great clips, but you get a lot more for your money."
"update!the manager of the location, sarah, called and was extremely apologetic and very gracious.  she was upset that i was made to pay for this haircut.  my intention was not get anyone fired and that is not what happened... the person quit without notice and is no longer a stylist there.  she was there for only 3 days and i just wanted to update my review as she is not a reflection of my experience there and i have been going there for a couple of years.  if that stylist had continued to work there, i would not have gone back as the review below does not actually reflect just how bad that person treated me.  also, i wanted to clarify that it was not because of a bad yelp review that they acted.  i used the contact form on the company website and sarah reached out to me based on that.  a company cannot control all of their employees all the time... humans will be humans and i feel sarah handled the situation very professionally and to my satisfaction.  i will be giving them another chance to keep my business and, based on my experiences prior to this one stylist, i imagine i will be happy with the haircut and the extra treatment sports clips offers.worst haircut of my adult life! i used to get my haircut here fairly regular probably won't ever be back. they had me in the system for an inch and a half on the sides 2 inches on the top. she took the razor and went down the side and i felt like i had just entered the military. when i said something about it she said that is one and a half inches that is the attachment i used. later she said it was a mistake on the notes and they had it down as a number one attachment. funny thing is that never happened before. i doubt it is even a quarter inch as i can barely even pinch the hair on the side of my head. the challenge is my hair goes spiky when it is too short and so i will have to deal with that for the next few weeks as it grows back. wouldn't be as big a deal but i have a youtube series i am supposed to be recording over the next two weeks. and this is not a confidence booster."
"a haircut is a necessity but the stylists at this place make it a pleasure, with a massage and hot towels. they listen carefully and keep notes on what you like from visit to visit. i recommend them."
"i came here a year ago and had a fantastic experience. since then i always come to see amber, she has a great haircuting ability. you won't be disappointed."
amazing experience every time i am in there! i have been going back for almost 6 months now. i have been to other sports clips but have found this one to be the one i like the most. i drive from mesa to this location just to get my hair cut by amber. she does a great job!
"very cute and good performing employees, however they're extremely understaffed. usually never more than 2 employees working which is truly ridiculous. especially for being in a shopping center"
always have a good experience when i come here. staff is friendly and they let you know how long it will be if there is a wait. i'm usually in and out in less than 30 min.
i'm not a fan of the theme.  they could do much better on the theme.they could make it far more sporty and it would be cool.  they don't stick with the theme well.staff is ok.  nothing great or horrid.
"the boys love coming here.  conveniently located right down the street from our house and usually get in very quick.  stadium style seating, sports themed, locker room setting and a tv for us bystanders to watch football, baseball or basketball depending on time of year and time of day.  complimentary water bottles for those waiting also.   an assortment of magazines if you are the reading type.  very friendly staff and the boys always act a little cockier once they get their new hair-do.  i shave my head at the house or i'd come here as well.  kids and seniors are $15.00.  adults $18.00 and the mj- $23.00 for a cut, steamed towel, shampoo and neck and shoulder massage."
my son's hair cut today was one out of a book of horrors. we asked for a simple  undercut. what we got was a lopsided fade with uneven sideburns and a crooked back line.  the free bald spot he got will grow out in time however the verbal shellacking i received from my wife because i let my son get mangled by these horrible people will not.no thanks.
the absolute worse customer service i've ever experienced at a barber shop. i was in the area and stopped in for a cut. assent greeted or acknowledged by either of the two girls on staff. as one finished her cut she cleaned up her station and didn't even look my direction. as the second finished her hour of chatting as two of us sat patiently for a cut she grabbed him still not asking if i needed anything. still the second sat around doing nothing. i would never come here again and highly recommend anyone wanting a haircut to do the same. if you want to chat meaninglessly this is your spot!
"i love sports clips, especially the mvp package, you get a haircut, shampoo, steam towel,face massage and then even a shoulder massage all for a little over $20 :-)allyssa cut my hair this time and she did a great job, i have a lot of thick hair (thanks mom) so it takes a while and she took her time. the wait was only about 10 minutes but most of the time there is no wait at this location."
terrible service and even worse haircuts. dont waste your time here. go to a barbershop where they can actually do a half way decent job of cutting hair.
"haven't had such a bad haircut  since my mother did my brothers and my hair as kids. the wait was over half an hour with two people ahead of me but only two barbers working. i have a relatively simple hairstyle, nothing fancy at all. the lady doing my cut was getting sick or just getting over a cold, i don't know but she kept coughing and had to leave for a while to get her composure and cough drops. (why come to work with the public if you're sick?) she butchered a simple fade, left me with a near bald spot on the side of my head and had to be asked to cut the long hairs she left over my ears.  very displeased!"
"yvonne does my fiancé and my 2 year old sons hair. every time she does such a great job!! my little boy does great with her, he likes her haha"
"i got the coupons in the mail, so i decided to give it a try. the atmosphere was welcoming and evonne was very nice. the wait was a little long, but expected because it was a friday night. my boy was usually nervous because he didn't like the sound of the clipper, but evonne did such a great job at talking to him and distracting him. i will defintely go back to this sport clips and ask for evonne next time."
i just had a haircut here at sports clips on dobson and baseline and it was the best haircut experience i have ever had. i have an anniversary date tonight so i wanted to make sure my hair looks really good. melinda is excellent and a perfectionist so my hair looks fantastic. i've been to sports clips several times before and the haircuts are always pretty good but melinda has exceeded my expectations and really went above and beyond to make sure my hair looks perfect. i really appreciate it and i hope melinda gets the credit she deserves. if you come here to sports clips try to get an appointment with melinda. awesome job.
"this is a nice location. usually pretty slow, but at times can get busy. expect a 20 minute or so wait just due to the amount of ladies working here. i usually come on sundays so i am ready for my week. it is really clean as well at this location. if you haven't been here before you get a free upgrade to mvp. i will be back to this one as long as i am in the area."
"loved the cut, great customer experience, talented and pleasant employees. i will definitely be back, thanks to the friendly and professional service from danielle!"
never knew such a great place existed! trust me guys go here to get your hair cut. cheaper than a salon. way better than a barber.
i stopped here by chance and i ended up having a really great experience.  my hair stylist took her time to make sure my haircut came out looking sharp. i thought this was a great deal for the price and i will be coming back in the future.
"marissa has been cutting my hair the last 3 times, i'm hoping she stays around as i have never been happier. mvp is the only way to go."
i take my son here and he always gets the cut that he wants!! the staff here really keep a good conversation with him. the place is always clean and has a great vibe.
i went for a hair cut...  i noticed all of her clippers all had hair on them. at the end i asked the stylist to be sure and get the hair in my neck. never happened and i did not notice due to her talking too much. i asked  her to style my hair and she handed me a brush...? the brush was covered with hair. filthy and nasty... avoid.
"very convenient location with lots of parking.  staff is very friendly and all do an excellent  job of styling hair per your request. equipment appears clean snd well maintained. the ""mvp"" includes a hot towel, wash, and back message.  each chair has a tv with espn.  prices are great. only downside if they follow the corporate policy of no appointments which is a real  bummer."
this is a great place for a haircut! my boys love going to see amanda there. she always does a great job on current trendy styles and they won't let anyone else touch their hair! the facility and equipment is always clean. highly recommended.
great place to get a haircut! stylists are great! great atmosphere. mvp is the way to go.
great place! the stylists are friendly and do a great job. the place was busy but properly staffed so the wait was less then 10 minutes with no appointment needed. mvp treatment is a great treatment that left me refreshed and invigorated. i'll definitely be returning. kid-friendly and plenty of tvs to watch
a friend introduced me to sportclips and i couldn't be happier. this is like the spa for guys plenty of sports on tvs inside and you have to love the treatment you get with the mvp package.
"great first experience trying sports clips out after patronizing a nearby competitor for 12 years that's gone downhill. amanda was great, very friendly and courteous. the equipment and working area was very clean and since it was my first visit i got the shampoo, hot steam and shoulder massage $5 off but for $22 it's a great deal and i'll definitely be back."
"in moving to phoenix one of the immediate challenges was in locating a good barber.in lieu of having the time to look and trial and error i ended up at sport clips.the stylists are friendly but also wildly inconsistent so once you find one that gives you the cut you want, you will need to request her by name from then forward.the full treatment to always cool as the hot towel and wash are relaxing.the massage thingy is a bit of a time waster.sport clips is worth the 3 stars"
"i've been going to sport clips for several years.  i used to go to great clips.  there is a big difference.  not that there is anything wrong with great clips, but sport clips really raises the bar for adding to the hair cut experience.  every time i have received a hair cut i have upgraded to at least a triple play.  the shampoo (mini head massage) with tea tree shampoo and a steam towel on the face after the cut is what keeps me coming back.  the staff at the ahwatukee location are attentive and friendly.  they often get busy but the have sufficient staff to handle the wait time.  i'll be back fo' sho'!  :)"
"i was visiting from out of town and realized i was looking like teen wolf so i needed a taper, bad!! it was 4:45pm on a sunday and they close at 5pm. i walk in expecting them to be like ""great its that guy who comes in when were about to close..."" not at all! i was greeted promptly and got matched up with racheal. she sure knows her way around some scissors! she cut me up good!! not only was the cut top notch, she gave me a minty flavored towel to wrap around my face while she used another minty flavored shampoo product to massage my head!! did i mention the chair was a massage chair? yeah. this place is legit!!!! highly recommend"
"i had an issue with a previous haircut at this location and was contacted directly by the manager, leanne.she was more then willing to see me right away to fix my haircut.   i went in on 5/26 and met with leanne in person.   she took me asap and addressed the issue i had with my haircut from the day before and assured me it would not happen again.  i was more than pleased and will definitely be coming back to this location in the near future.   i will highly recommend having leanne service you as she is upbeat, very personable, profesional.   she definitely gave me the sport clips experience i have always expected and experience at many other locations."
"stopped in for a quick haircut for my son today.  been to this sports clips numerous times.  all stylists were very nice, attentive and shop was nice/clean.  after i explained what i wanted typical short blended, pretty traditional kid haircut.  the stylist took him back and cut his hair.  after 5-8 minutes she asked me to come back and take a look and unfortunately i really wasn't paying attention i just glanced and said ok.got home and seen his hair outside in the sun and was unpleasantly surprised.looks like she went too high on neck line and it was crooked... and looks like there was an oops little patch, as well as the blend/fade was spotty.  minor bits of longer hair was still on neck and around ears.  i did call and they were very nice and offered for me to come back and fix it but we were already home.  i am posting hopefully so they will not let someone else walk out of the shop like that."
fast service. nice warm face wrap vibration chair and hair wash. nice message afterward. friendly ladies and great haircut also.go for the mvp. it's great.
friendly and personable stylists... everything else is simply atmosphere (which itself has improved tremendously over the years). evan at this location is the best!
just change over to this place after a few botched haircuts from the other clips. my 3 boys and i really appreciate shara and the work she did. we are all pretty picky and she cut out hair exactly how we wanted. thanks shara!
"leanne, evan, erika and the team are always friendly, give great cuts and the shop is friendly and easy."
i was fortunate to have evan cut my hair.  it was a fantastic experience.  she did a wonderful job and took the time to listen to me about my hair and how i like it to look.  evan is a wonderful ambassador of the organization.
the mvp is awesome and jackie is a great stylist and funny. not rushed in n out like some other places.
"great place for a haircut.  fun environment with ladies that know how to give a quality hair cut.   i prefer kim, however they are all very good.   rarely is there a long wait.   highly recommend this location."
"i love getting my haircut here. as a guy, i don't have (or need) a ""regular"" stylist. sports clips is great because they take all of the awkward conversation out of it. no need to feel guilty making small talk, because you can watch the game while your hair is being cut. that being said, the staff is always warm and friendly, and i haven't gotten a bad cut yet. i give four stars instead of five because the wait time is a bit long at times."
"kim is my new favorite cutter.  i'm a seasoned veteran of sport clips, but had never been to this location.  she greeted me warmly, signed me in, sat me down, and got started.  this is the point at which she distinguished herself -- she started by asking me questions and actually listening to what i had to say.  kim figured out my hair and the radical (for me) changes i wanted to make.  halfway trough the cut, she stopped and carefully reviewed the progress with me before finishing the job.after the ordeal (haha!), i bounced out of the shop with my most satisfactory haircut in years.  i'll go back to this sport clips again and when i do, i'll have kim pull another rabbit out of her hat.  if you're looking for a haircut, give this place a shot."
"if you're man/woman and you're looking to get a great haircut, this is the place to be. i highly recommend visiting shelby o the manager, to get top of the line customer service and a saloon quality cut. she is excellent at what she does and on top of that has an amazing personality that makes getting a haircut something you look forward to, not something you look at as a chore. next step is to book an appointment and see the quality you'll be receiving for an affordable price."
"i've been a regular at sport clips since my first review (nov 17, 2016) of the arizona pavilions location in marana.since then i moved to chandler and have been a customer at this location for a few months now.the price for a haircut at this location is a little higher than i was paying in marana. however, i still believe it is a good value due to the quality of the service.i also appreciate the fact that they usually have more staff on duty than the marana location and so the wait time is shorter, especially on busy saturday mornings."
"been coming to this location for a while now and i love it. all of the stylists do a great job and the staff turn over here isn't like other barbershops as it's low. with a yelp check in you get $5 off the very relaxing mvp which includes a cut, shampoo, warm steamed towel and massage. also, if you bring your receipt with you before 30 days, you get $3 off. espn is on all day and they provide free bottled water."
"up and down experience here. haircuts have been great, but wait times are too long. frustrating to come in to a 30 minute wait and then get bumped another 15 minutes because of an obvious regular, who frankly didn't need a haircut, for reasons i'll let you figure out.as someone who's been in customer service for 20+ years this kind of thing drives me up the wall."
dude sarah is the bomb dot com. i do a lot of moving around and i always have trouble finding a stylist i actually feel comfortable with. i showed her one picture and she got the job done perfectly.
good mens cut. unfortunately had to wait over an hour.
"the girls at this location are flawless! i come to this location because it just happens to be the closest, but i have been to probably 9 different sportclips. this one stands out the most, mostly for customer service. i one random day i decided to try this location after the new move, and i was hooked since. the manager is great, as well as everyone employed there. i am moving again soon, but am debating driving the extra mile to keep this place my main!these girls deal with people all the time that come in 5 minutes to close (i'm not one of them!), and they keep their composure with a smile on their face. that's just one example that separates them from other locations. chelsea that just moved from this location will be missed, as she was the best head massager ever.dana is definitely at the top of the list when it comes to a quality haircut. she listens, and cuts accurately! she can also put up with a rediculous non stop conversation from me. ask for her!"
"went in this morning, waited forever as the stylists chatted at length without barely cutting their clients hair.  the loud tvs made the wait unbearable."
"dana did a great job.good cut, good massage.had a migraine going in... no headache after leaving."
i live in tempe. i know there are several sport clips locations that are closer but this one is by far my favorite! it is worth the extra miles for a good quality haircut. jenn is by far my favorite stylist! :) she goes above and beyond in her mvp massages
was feeling brave one day and decided to change my old hairdo in for a new trendy one... the gal that cut my hair made sure to walk me through all of the decisions to make it my new haircut. thanks guys for what you do!
"do not recommend.  the lady who cut my hair had 11 years experience and still got it wrong. i asked for a taper and she gave me a fade. in addition i had to go back because how jagged the lines were. she was happy to fix it but made excuses why it looked that way, blaming my hair.  i'm white if that tells you anything about my hair.  i saw another guys haircut and it was crooked as well. ended up shaving it off."
"a year and a half later, and jessica is still the haircut girl of my dreams. there have been a couple of occasions where i've had to get cut by other girls at sport clips, and even cuts at places other than sportclips. the sportclips cuts were always good, far above the other places i went to . be sure to tell jessica hi for me if you go in!"
"ever since moving to az 4 years ago i have been coming to sportclips on ray and the 101. i have had several of the stylists cut my hair and they all do a fabulous job. i do admit that i have a very simple haircut and it comes out perfect every time. i prefer to have my haircut done by chelsea. why i prefer chelsea is when she washes my hair, to me, it is not just a wash but more like a massage on my head. she will get parts of my head and neck that gives me full body goosebumps. i have never had anything like this in the past.  chelsea is always happy to see me. i am a very loyal customer to awesome service and this place delivers."
the reviews didn't lie! had an awesome experience. received the mvp package for the introductory price since that was my first time there. chelsea did a great job!
"today on my way to groceries i stopped in to get my step son a hair cut. we had a short ten minute wait and then he was called back by jackie. she told us his cut was being upgraded to the ""mvp"" since we were first time customers. he got a shampoo, scalp massage and hot towels after his cut.jackie did a fantastic job! she listened and cut his hair exactly the way i wanted it. after trying so many places and being disappointed, i was thrilled with his cut and for only $13. his hair has never looked better. i hope jackie sticks around, we will definitely be back."
"having never been here before, we had no idea what to expect. my boyfriend has always loved having long hair and decided it was time to chop it off for a more professional look. he was super nervous! i brought a couple of pictures of ideas that he liked (knowing it wouldn't come out exactly like them but something along the lines of them). krista explained what was possible and what wasn't. she gave us her input and we talked and laughed the whole time. she did such an amazing job! i couldn't believe my boyfriend left so happy! krista is such a sweet girl who was so very accommodating, friendly and amazing at her job. no doubt he'll be back to see her!"
"first haircut in arizona after moving from ca.  kathryn went above and beyond to make me feel welcome, she took her time to understand what i want and spent about 40 minutes on my mvp - priceless...!!!  will defiantly be back."
horrible haircut. she didn't even listen to what i wanted. if you want to feel like a sheep and have electric shears run over your head for 5 minutes and then charged 18 bucks this is the place to go. i won't ever be going back!!!
"so i tried this place out after vowing not to return to great clips. the haircut was as expected with a short wait time, and what is cool is they will do a trim around your neck line and ears in between haircuts. i took them up on it prior to my trip to mobile. overall an ok experience. i don't expect a lot from getting my haircut, they met the need."
"this place has great ambiance! we were greeted with a ""welcome to sports clips"" in unison, and then  once we walked to the front to check in, one of their hairstylists said ""good morning"" and then asked if we had been there before. i'm pretty big on the small things that employees are not required to do- such as the "" good morning."" once we filled out  our name and phone number, we sat on folding chairs that had a cushion. the seats faced the front  where the stylists were. there was two screen tvs showing games. it's a sports lovers place for sure! the stylists have lockers to hold towels, and their supplies so it is not cluttered like other places. the prices are painted on the wall. when your sitting, it's a little hard to see, i had to stand up. they use the online check in system and i love that for time manage purposes. when we checked in it said wait time was 3 min. and it was exact! how often does that happen, right?  anyhow, linda cut my sons hair, and fixed what another company could not do. i asked for a one on the sides l, and short scissor cut on top with a little to comb and flip in the front.  what i thought should have been a quick 2 min fix, resulted in a full 13 min haircut. linda was thorough with the haircut, took her time, and once complete examined it and then said ""i'd like to tighten around the top if it's okay with you"" i appreciated this very much. again, how often does this happen?  as we exited, they have a box of combs at front that says ""take one free"" - huge perk! thanks! i will be back and hope to find the same service again!!"
there is always a long wait and never enough people cutting hair. i love sport clips but this location is never prepared enough. if you want an hour wait on a tuesday afternoon then this is the spot for you. don't even think about getting in and out on a weekend day in under an hour and a half.
"i've been getting my haircut here once a week for the last six months. i'm a huge fan of the sports clips brand. pro's: my stylist is the best. great fade, clean edge up.. really just the best. love the free neck trims!con's: the wait time is hit or miss. this place is always packed, but i don't mind waiting.. knowing that i'll get a great cut. not all of the stylists are friendly (or even attempt to be), but hey.. i'm good with mine lol."
place seems to always be packed which is always a good thing.jose always gives me a great haircut and the staff is always very polite and courteous
"good haircuts,  get the mvp deal, its worth it."
"it took me a while to find someone i was comfortable with, but when i finally stepped in, wow was i happy.my stylist knows my name and doesn't need to be told what i like. i know they make notes in their computer, but not having to explain my preferences over and over and over is refreshing. my son & i both have our hair done here and, i must admit, i'm a sucker for the massaging shampoo. the fact that i get to watch sports, then sit and chat for half an hour is cool with me. kudos to the nice staff and clean establishment. 5 stars!"
didn't honor my sports clip coupon i got off at high school coupon book in the area. i actually was already in my seat and got up and left. i feel like if the company is going to release coupon they should be city wide.
"its all about the individual stylist you get. i have gotten a decent haircut at this location, but this last one was pretty bad.  looked like i did it myself with a pocketknife. i know that if i go back they will cheerfully fix the uneven spots, but that would make it far shorter than what i wanted."
"friendly staff and a great haircut.  got the works, the massage chair was a little over the top but the shampoo with massage was very nice.  stylist took her time and we talked while cutting my hair.  just like all saloons, they try to upsale you  to their shampoo, styling products but not too much pressure.  thanks for supporting vets - got a free haircut and they treated me like a vip."
"ok, i'll admit that i'm a total sucker for having my head washed. the vip package is a great way to treat myself.  i just have to remember to avoid them on the weekends. seems like everyone gets their haircut on the weekend.  my only other complaint, seems like there is a lot of turn over. i've been going to this location for over 2 years and only had the same stylist do my hair once, all the other times, it was someone new to me."
"being in the military there are many things that you have to do upon moving to a completely new area, one of which being: ""where the heck am i going to get my hair cut?""sport clips has been my go-to place for about 2 years now, and upon moving to the san antonio area and needing my first haircut here, i naturally went to the closest sport clips and i was not disappointed!first time customers get the mvp treatment (hot towel, shampoo, massage) for only the price of a haircut, which for me with a military discount comes out to about $14.my hair looks great, the stylists are always nice, and this will be my new go-to location.my only suggestion is to make an appointment, because walk-ins on busy days will wait around 30 mins like i did. not a deal breaker, but will definitely try to work around the busy hours."
i am giving them 5 stars! however it is only 5 stars if you get dulce. its about a 3 star service if you get anybody else. dulce doesn't rush you and she ensures that your haircut is perfect and that you get your money's worth when you get a mvp. if you get anybody else you will feel rushed and feel like you paid to much.
"do you remember the flowbee? what a stupid idea. how about it's lesser known idiot cousin the robocut? that action had a picture of a human girl getting her hair cut on one side, and a long haired canine on the other. no, seriously.the moral of the story here is i never used any of those to cut my own hair, but i did in fact cut my own hair. once i got tired of doing it my self i set out to find a place that cost more then $5 for a mens hair cut, but less then $100. sport clips is where i ended up. they do try to fill a niche, however it's not one i'm completely that excited about. if you like watching sports instead of socializing with your barber(ess?) then this is the place for you.the one thing that i appreciate the most about the sport clips franchise is it's consistency. the fact that they specialize in mens haircuts also helps. i've gone to multiple locations both in and out of city and walked out with the same cut. of course i don't have anything ""flock of seagulls"" complicated, but still, the point is if i did i'd be able to get it at any sc location.seriously, the robocut. i mean. why? why?"
"absolutely the best place to get a haircut! no ifs, ands, or buts about it! the friendly staff, quick service, and fantastic atmosphere are all just a tip of the iceberg compared to the fantastic haircut that i received from laura! the absolute best haircut i have received since retiring from the navy. i like having hair after over 20 years of not having any and now i love my hair do! i can't give laura enough praises for her caring and professional work. i won't go anywhere else or let anyone else cut my hair!"
by far the best barbers i've gone to in  san antonio. couldn't find a barbershop that i liked since i moved here two years ago.    wait time is little to none. especially if you check-in online. upon entering through the doors there's always a warm-welcome and a followed through hand shake. they have in their system comments on what kind of haircut of always get. they listen to you and ask allot of questions before they start cutting your hair.    you can just tell and sense that they're eager to give you the best haircut possible. amazing staff!they're my official barbers now. keep up the good work!
"i popped in for a last minute haircut and one particular professional stuck out to me based on presentation alone. susy gave me the exact haircut i wanted and she had in-depth knowledge of the style that works well with my face, my hair type and product to go with it as well. i'll be the first to admit that i'm totally stand-offish when it comes to buying new products but susy discusses the what, how, and why behind it all and i'm sold. the best haircut i've had in a few years. i will be back!"
so pissed right now. i just got the shittiest fade ever.  how can something so basic get screwed up?! i would've paid her not to cut my hair. now i gotta go to work looking like shjt.never again.
for a sport clips i didn't expect much and i wouldn't be upset if it wasn't perfect but i had the lady by the name of bee cut my hair and i was really good actually. i just told her what i thought i wanted and make it look good and was honestly one of the best haircuts i've gotten. never left a review on yelp but definitely worth it.
"honestly best place to make conversation and get a great haircut!!  not to mention a hot towel and massage, 10/10 in my book!!  #winningif you go, ask for shanna!!  she's a superb stylist and is someone who keeps me going there"
"i used the online check-in and selected megan. i was greeted upon arriving and only had to wait a few minutes.  i'm not super picky or anything but the last time megan styled my hair i had a good experience and she recommended some products to help manage my gray. i had some gold tones that were bothering me and the shampoo she used and recommended for me to try at home is working.  megan is another go to stylist for me at sportclips,  andre and megan would be my two draft picks if there was a draft for stylist."
"thank god for sport clips, after a haircut that looked like something out of botched, the tv series, that i received from locker room hair cuts, charlene took time out of her day to give her best attempt at cleaning it up and making it look much much better. i'm so grateful for sport clips and their trained team of hair professionals. sport clips 10/10locker room haircuts -10/10 (that's even giving too much credit)."
awesome barber!  easy process to walk in and megan w. was great!!  also nice that they provide an option to donate to vets.  definitely recommend if you're in the area.
"i am new to the area, from louisiana and i had an old czechoslovakian barber there that used to cut my hair. an old man that went to world war 2, cursed, spat tobacco in a spitoon, and cut my hair with a pair of stainless steel scissors that sat in a jar of blue water. i'd get a shave too with a straight razor. well those days are over. i moved here and none of the barber's here are any good. they suck, they try too hard and they're not very likable. plus the last guy i went to jacked up my hair and did a horrible job on it. i found this place and it is what it is. you walk in and if you can wait, you wait. if you have a stylist you like you wait for her, if she's there, or you take whoever is available. i don't care so much about who does it, as my hair is easy to do and i wear a hat so when it gets long enough i go down here to have it trimmed down. those guy's complaining about their 'hair' not right or whining about something off, get over yourself. probably these same guys wearing tight shirts showing man nipple with slim jeans that will get them an ass kicking or man rape in certain parts of town. please. i go in here for an old school john unitas flattop buzzcut.it isn't what i'm used to but i hate everyone in the area here. the girls here are nice and haven't annoyed me yet so i will keep coming here."
"i've always had a great experience at this location. shanna is a great stylist! she's attentive to detail and has given me great advice on different hairstyles. she's very polite and professional, as is all the staff. i would definitely recommend this location."
worst hair cut ever!!!!! i will never ever bring my son to get a hair cut at this place ever again. they latterly chopped of pieces of his hair. we asked for a specific hair cut and were given a chop off. the stylist seems to cut her own hair as well since hers was chopped the same way. we were disappointed my son left that place crying because he had waited to let his hair grow for 2 mo. to have the hair cut we asked and showed a pic of. now we had to wait again to let it grow and took him to a more experience stylist to fix her mess up.
great service.  sharlene is the best!!!
nothing to write home about - nothing particularly special about this business.  i expected more because the location is an upscale new shopping center in san antonio.
do not go to this sport clips hey will mess up your hair. drive to other locations instead.
if you love your sports and a great haircut. this is the place. upbeat! always have product stocked. all the staff is friendly. they know the latest styles. always recommend the best product for your hair type.
great haircut from niki and she knew her products very well! even though i don't live in san antonio she made me feel like i was a regular i will definitely be coming back! great value!
never again! for the fifth time over looked and ignored. other patrons welcomed and helped while i waited.  had customer mention to stylist i was there before him and it did not matter.  can i give no stars?
"i'm really impressed my this franchises' consistency.  great location, given the enormous selection of shops and how close it is to a tourist spot like fiesta texas.  staff was quick and i got a great cut."
"traveling around san antonio with business the past 3 years , this is my place for a hair cut  . friendly atmosphere and enjoying going here . danny and kevisa is great . i highly recommend going here . they'll cut your hair the way you want it ."
everyone is always so friendly and professional. always have danny cut my hair.does an excellent job.always fun to talk to. has a one happy customer.
"i've been to sports clips in cali and va. this is the best know i've been to. i was really hesitant to come here because my previous experiences have been not good. but in sa this was the only open haircut place i could find open on a sunday. alex did a great job with my hair did everything i requested. actually she is the only barber i've been to that actually combed my hair the same way i do. usually the barber will put gel in my hair and comb it all crazy!! not alex, she did a great job cutting, shampooing, and re-styling it! she used a gel that worked really good. i may have to switch to a new gel! got the mvp service. cut, hot towel, shampoo, massage, and gel. i'll come back before i leave sa."
"hair stylist, danny rushed through a simple hair cut and did not ensure that my hair was even. i now have lines throughout my hair, never again sports clips. the only thing you have going for you is that you play sportscenter throughout the building."
i've been coming here for about a year and it's been a mixed of good and bad haircuts but lately it has been the latter. this hairstylist named britney cannot i repeat cannot cut hair. she has a bad attitude all the time and has already screwed up my hair twice.
hair stylist took over an hour to cut my hair then called for help. manager came and tried to salvage what was left of my hair of the terrible hair cut i received. it's been two months and and still my hair has grown evenly! all they offered was a free mvp upgrade ? so pretty much i paid for a terrible mess up they couldn't even fix. it's the worst comb over ever. the back side looked like i had a bowl hair cut.
last few times i was here they had a stylist who fudged up my hair so royally i told her she could never touch my hair again. ha. flash forward about 1 year. i still see some stylists that i'd seen time ago but i think these are the good ones that are still here. this time i had lisa cut my hair and she did a superb job. she cut it exactly the way i liked it so i thankfully think i have found someone in town who is worth visiting. a few more great visits and i'll change my review to 5 stars.
"i asked for a simple paid for my son. as you can see this is not a clean haircut. when i told them how i wanted it, she scoffed at the terminology i used. that should've been the first sign to leave right away. if you want a haircut that is clean, don't go here."
"been here twice now. each time i received a great haircut an using the mvp got a hot towel, shampoo and neck massage too. even though the place was busy both times (lunch hours) i was greeted warmly and served quickly. although they will use product in your hair of you want,they are not pushy with the sales pitch for it, which is nice. they also do a free touch-up service as well within a certain time window after your haircut."
"yelp really needs to add a no star option. we brought our son to get the ""mvp"" experience and boy were we disappointed. excuse my french, but the staff here sucks. i'm sure the other locations aren't as rude so we will take our buisness there. no greeting, no smiles and definitely no love.......some mvp experience most valueless personalities"
"dani is the best. i drive by 3 sports clips to see her. she is friendly, quick, and accurate."
"best haircut i've had in a while! crystal did an amazing job on my out of control hair. as usual the interior was awesome and clean. the staff is always friendly and skilled. i was in and out in about a half hour, which is pretty quick for most.i've been to many places to cut my hair over the years, i'm in love with sport clips!"
"5 stars for the service provided by jennifer.friendly, professional and quality work. i would highly recommend going here for a haircut and requesting that jennifer be your stylist. i also recommend that you go with the mvp. you will be treated like a star and leave very relaxed."
"this is probably the fastest i've gotten an mvp at a sports clips.  not complaining, but i guess i like the experience to be a little longer.  usually speedy haircut means bad haircut.  nope.  i went at the end of the work day too, so i'm sure the stylist was tired, but she did a great job.  after a cut and shampoo, i was out of there in probably 20 mins."
"i must have a weird head as i tend to get awful haircuts. anyways i went on post and the entire ait class was ahead of me. i left and searched for another barber shop that was open at 1100 on a sunday.  anyways, my son and i went to sports clips. i didn't wait long and i got a decent haircut.  i will probably go back. i have to admit the girls looked nothing like the ones in the advertisements, but otherwise everything was great."
went in for a haircut on my lunch break. don't know her name but one of the blonde stylists just was careless. hit my in the face with the cord for the sideburn trimmer and left dozens of hairs at different lengths on top. i've never had a bad experience with sports clips until now. i will never go to this location again.
"i got a really bad haircut here in december 2013. before that i had to go back to fix what another location(rim) missed. seems to be a trend with all sport clips, where it's all about numbers. i won't be going back. to any sport clips. ever."
"place is great! staff is courteous and are prompt to recognize you arrived to the store...greeting you. my husband cut his hair &was very quick, great service &clean."
"excellent place for guys' haircuts!  my boys have both come here in the past week and have come out looking great!!  the prices are reasonable, the place is absolutely spotless and everyone is super nice.  also, since it was their first time, they got the mvp treatment for the regular ""varsity"" price.  it included a cut, massaging shampoo, steamed towel and shoulder/back massage.  happy campers! :o)"
"always have a great experience at this location. the manager cuts my hair and always ensures it is right before she is done. consistent cut everytime, she is an outstanding stylist and highly recommend."
"i can expect the same haircut every time no matter who is working, same reasonable price."
"i always enjoy coming here. this is the only place me and my 3yr old son go. ask for claudia, she does an awesome job every time."
"waited 40 minutes to get my son in, it was busy when we got there. usually pretty good wait times. my son noticed one person got called that arrived after we did, i dismissed it, then they took a walk-in right back. after waiting that long my patience was gone. left and took him elsewhere and got him right in. i will never be going back to sport clips again."
always have a great stylist and haircut. great with the clippers.  i get a consistent cut even with different stylists.
"hair cuts for guys?! now that's what i'm talking about. tvs with sports and sports magazines and sports memorabilia if you want to buy some aggie banners. i've heard of other places offering a frosty brew as well for an additional $20 or so. no thanks, i don't need to drink beer at 11 o'clock in the morning on a tuesday, because that's usually when i steal away for a haircut. the ladies here are pros. no, not that kind of a pro. i expect their revolving door swings a bit more slowly based on how well they cut hair. they seem to have a knack for men's hair and i always get a great cut from them. by comparison once upon a time, many years ago in a fantastic sam's my ""stylist"" fresh out of cosmetology school immediately grabbed her clippers before even asking me how i wanted it cut. after i explained my scissor preference she replied "" oh, you gonna have all that wavy hair and stuff"", just before she butchered me in a way that took me back to my childhood and my aging barber in the shop with the hypnotic tri-colored pole out front. to make the occasion completely indelible to memory someone locked the door from without and we had to wait fifteen minutes for another employee to rescue us by sliding a spare key under the door. i could feel the stares of the other trapped customers as well as the employees towards my brutalized scalp. i felt like the kid down the street with piojos who got the mercy shave. no such treatment at sports clips. these people have it together and even offer free neck shaves from time to time as you need them. yuk! dude if you need a neck shave in between cuts, i might want to keep that a little more private. you will also get the scalding hot towel on the face and a solid massaging shampoo. ahhhhhh."
"been coming here for about a year now. the customer service is good. haircuts are hit or miss depending on who i get, however. i like the shampoo they use. not much else to say about this place."
great place for a haircut. i'm pretty picky about my haircut and every time i come here my haircut turns out great.
first time at this location and i had better service than i have at other locations. i got taken care of quickly and got a free mvp for it being my first time.
kind lady but worst haircut i've gotten in a long time. asked for a simple skin medium fade and to trim top if needed. she spent 30 mins trying to fade my hair. i finnaly had to ask how much longer then she said 3 mins. when she was done she had messed up the top  i had to ask another lady to fix it. she cut it up in mins. i left unhappy and not satisfied with how my hair is now. will not be back here.
"worst haircut experience ever... for my almost 3 year old and myself. ivette moved so slow my son quickly lost interest (him sitting in a salon chair has never once been an issue- he has gone every 2-3 weeks since he was 1!). then, instead of dusting the hair trimmings off like a normal stylist, she hits him with a blow dryer multiple times, covering him (and myself- sitting a chair away) in hair! who does that?! he was so irritable and itching his back, neck, and face the entire time. i finally picked him up and held him still so she could finish. we were there for far too long and then had to pay $15 for a 3 year olds haircut! we left with a crappy cut, both of us covered in hair, and a rash from all the hair that was blown down his shirt. on a positive note- the other woman working in there completed two men's cuts while my toddler wiggled miserably in ivette's chair. she did not blow their hair trimmings all over them either....  avoid ivette and you'll probably be ok!"
"absolute trash haircut from pattie. pretty much insulted me from start to finish. came in and she said my hair was off center, she fixed it now it looks so bad i've had to shave my head. more than that she told me the whole time how bad my eczema was. next she told me i have a midwestern accent, when i told her i was from california she just argued with me. it was all just obscene and abrasive and strange. run from pattie, terrible experience."
"myriah is very nice but gives very bad haircuts (picture attached).  manager was great she fixed it for me, but i think she should've offered to at least refund me my tip."
"the staff is extremely nice, but they are horrible at giving haircuts. when i ask for a certain cut, don't do it the way you think it should be. do what i asked for. both times i went, i asked for a certain way, and both times they went their own route. although they're extremely nice, i won't be going back after two times of awful haircuts. maybe they just can't do fades, i don't know."
"i have been coming here once a week for the past 18 months to get hair cuts. i know all of their staff very well. if you as an individual can't see that your hair isn't the way you want it until you drive home, then that is on you. i always get a nice high fade with a sub zero that draws many complements at work and around town. i encourage anyone that wants a good experience to come here for a cut."
great looking shop and great stylists! the staff is very friendly and always provide a excellent haircut. the mvp is an awesome experience. go sportclips!!
"this is the only place that can get my son's hair right consistently. we were tired of the bowl cut, and finally found a place that knows how to get that ""skater cut"" look right.for a little extra, he can get a hot towel neck massage with his professionally done look.the customer service has always been fast and friendly during the week. the weekend is a little bit of a wait, but they do have a tv playing entertainment with comfy chairs while you wait.these ladies have taken a situation that once caused nervous anxiety for both of us to an enjoyable experience, and a young man who can now leave without a bag over his head."
"brought my son in to get a haircut earlier. nice work, very polite staff. will definitely be returning soon."
took my 10 year old in to get a cut. stood and waited to be greeted for 5 minutes. nothing. man and son walks in and she goes right to them and takes them right away (white folks). they appeared not to be happy to see my black son looking to get a cut. life has taught me when i'm not welcome. i turned and walked out. unfortunately it's not the first time i've tried a barbershop and got this response.  i usually do my homework to be sure the place is black friendly (able and willing to cut black hair)hopefully i can save some other black family the insult.
"this place in theory is a great escape for a man or son to have their hair cut, especially with the option to have their hair washed in the back. my son thought he was special having that done. but unfortunately this place is hit or miss with stylists. some are great while some have left my husband with an uneven cut or fade."
"i've been coming to this location for years and always received great service! i've got my stylist who knows my preferences and we always enjoy visiting. the location is convenient and there's rarely a wait. great haircut, good friend and sports - almost everything one needs when getting a haircut. i highly recommend this sports clips location."
seemed to be more like a local barbershop than your typical chain brand. i've been to several sports clip location and this one was very friendly
"went in for the 1st time today and won't be back. i showed her a picture of what i wanted for my son and i showed her how i wanted it styled. she left it too long on the bottom. i had a feeling she was going to, so i asked her is it going to be a little shorter later and she said yes she was going to go back and do that part later, well at the end of the cut it was still to long and you could hardly even tell he had a new cut. i didn't want to be rude and come right out and ask her to do it again so i just asked her to put it in the notes next time for it to be a a little shorter and to do a 1 up to a 2 and she said sure i'll put it in there, didn't offer to go back and fix it. i showed her two pics of how i wanted it and after cutting the top she just combed it over!? i showed her how i liked the front styled up and she didn't use any products and didn't style it at all!? i styled it my self in the parking lot for him. i paid extra to take him here because i thought they would know more and be more up to date with the current styles but to be honest he got a better hair cut from great clips for half the price last time. like i said this was my first time there and it'll be my last time, very unhappy, wish i would have went to a real barber shop."
my son has been going there for a few years now.  they are fast and professional.  he is always happy with the cut.
"the cut for my son was pretty good.   shorter than we asked but good quality. however, my son had his hair washed with cold water and got not hot towel.  when i pay $22 for a haircut at sport clips, i expect something better, including a hot towel.  i probably won't be going back again since the hot towel is the whole reason i would go to sport clips, & getting your hair washed not in cold water is kind of a bare minimum."
"do. not. visit. this. location!!!i brought my seven year old nephew here to get his haircut the other day and instead of leaving with a fresh new cut he left with brutally disturbing marks and scars around his skull.the hair stylist failed to take precaution while edging and this caused scarring and scabbing on my nephew's head. he was bleeding and wincing throughout the cut then was told he simply had ""sensitive skin""not only am i disgusted at the possibility of there being other customer's blood on the blade they used that sliced into his head, but also offended that not one employee or manager has reached out or responded to my phone calls or e-mails about this horrendous and life-scarring occurrence."
to be short: i had to touch up my hair when i got home. i will probably not use sports clips again.
"the staff here was amazing! i am from dallas and i am visit here for the weekend, compared to the locations in dallas, i felt that this place was top of the line. my stylist was asking questions to make sure i was happy. she was super personable and did a great job. she upgraded my to mvp, just because she was frustrated with the dallas locations not providing a good service!"
"i came here today for the first time and the woman who cut my hair was very good at her job but also is very kind. i don't remember her name but she has a little girl who graduates from preschool tomorrow. the young lady who cut my hair did a better job than even other sports clips i have been to. she took her time, for those of us with thick and wiry hair it's important, and went over difficult areas several times. needless to say, she did an incredible job and i will return because of her customer service and attention to detail with my difficult hair."
they always do a nice job and are friendly. sometimes the wait gets a bit long but for not making an appointment it goes fast enough. they have a great product line and the mvp with wash and massage it worth it.
"i've had mixed experiences here so i'll detail each shortly:first time i came here, jason was my barber and he did an excellent job.  most franchised barbershops don't usually cut ""ethnic"" hair properly nor do they understand common trends (i.e. a taper fade).  jason nailed it!  i would like to formally give him recognition for his great attitude and barber skills and i highly recommend him. the second time i dropped in jason wasn't there and some lady was my barber and she completely botched it and actually didn't cut it at the right measurements - i usually get my hair cut really short because it grows fast and she completely disregarded the measurements i told her and unfortunately on this particular morning, i had to be at work and didn't have time for her to go back and correct it.  the past few times i've visited this location have been on monday mornings and it seems like management is doing a poor job of matching labor to business traffic. each time the floor has been full with at least 4 people in the waiting room.  in other words, this may not be the place if you're on a time crunch."
"bad bad day today at sports clips on huebner oaks. i came in to get a haircut around 10:30 this morning. ive been coming here since 2005. ive had this location rated at 5 stars but after dealing with the smart mouth of this girl i know she's only been at this location less than a year i have no choice but to drop the store's rating.just to be fair, ive had this little girl cut my hair a few months back. she didn't cut it the way i wanted it but didnt make a big fuss about it. she's not who i normally get to cut my hair but there were only two stylists all together.she eventually called my name and when i sat on her chair she started reading the notes from previous times ive been there. i told not to focus on that because that's why i get my hair cut wrong and i offered to show her a picture of me when they cut it the way i like it. she said she can only go by those notes and looking at a picture wouldn't help her get an idea how i like my hair. im 41 years old and i have never had a stylist impose their ineptituds on me. so when i questioned her, her immediate answer was that i can go somewhere else. so i did. needles to say, not coming back. which sucks because there are other stylists at this location that know what they're doing. i'll post her picture so hopefully management takes care of this problem. girls like her belong working at hooters because she is a cutie but doesnt ""make the cut"" as a stylist."
"i have been to this location mutliple times & always experience horrible attitudes (from all but two of the stylists).  i went in on 7/1 for a trim & in addition to dealing with horrible attitude i received a horrible haircut.  she cut way more off than i asked for, completely changing my look (not for the better).  the two stylists i mentioned having good attitudes gave amazing haircuts as well (i wish i could remember their names, one is an older hispanic lady & the other is a young red haired lady).  my last experience, and sportclips lack of response to this issue, has me looking for a new barber; which is unforutnate because i have been a sportclips customer for over 9 years, but this last experience was truly horrendous enough to never return (and this location & corporate have failed to even reach out to offer an apology."
"i've been here several times over the past couple months and each time they botched the cut in a different way. this last time they managed to fade my hair all the way to the top of my head. like... i've literally never seen a fade this jacked up. i would be impressed if i wasn't so pissed. if you're older than twelve, chances are this place isn't for you."
they don't listen just use the razor and shave everything off and not even very good at that. after leaving i see many spots she missed. all they are trying to do is flip customers. i
do not go here they don't know how to cut hair took my hairline up and then blamed it on the shape of my head
i usually go to the one at sonterra cause i've known that stylist for years however i went to this location on saturday and arrived at about 20 minutes till 7:00 which is the time they're supposed to close i requested marisela and therefore had to wait got in the seat about 20 minutes till 8:00 and never felt rushed or pressured about being there way past closing time the stylist did an awesome job with my hair and took her time which i must admit i was concerned about getting rushed out not the case at all the other employees were just as patient and professional it's customer service and employees like those girls that night that create an awesome experience and repeat customers definitely my new go to sport clips
"the worst franchise haircut store.i am a year long customer in this store, and the experience wasn't the best but wasn't the worst either. today, a girl (who had a piercing on a tongue) did my haircut. and she was rushing through my haircut as if she was trying to get rid of me from the store. she didn't even ask how my neck part would be trimmed (which is something they usually asked: rounded or square, and i always get rounded). this time she did it square without asking me, and she couldn't fix it because it's already trimmed.also she was spinning my chair often just so she didn't have to move herself to cut my other side of hair. how lazy and rude is that.later, i realized there were many other customers in front of me, and she was just trying to earn one more customer's tip by finishing my haircut as fast as she can; basically stealing other hairstylist's customers. unbelievable.never going to this store again."
"the lady did a horrible job on my hair.  she asked if i wanted my part slightly defined, so i said yes.  instead of finding and cutting where my hair naturally parted, she just went and made a new part."
"i've had inconsistent haircuts here over the past several months.  generally, i have found the haircut length, etc. to be appropriate.  however, i have had issues with details like sideburns being cut to different lengths and uneven trim along the neck line.  due to the convenient location, i may continue going here if i'm crunched for time, but will try other places as well."
great haircut and good price with nearly no wait. i've been here several times over the last month and have been happy with the cut and service each time. i recommend to everyone.
been coming here around 6 months and this has to be the best place ive been to for pampering.  jessica knows what she is doing i highly recommend her to anyone that want a great cut.
"after using the same barber for over 20 years, i ventured out to try something new and closer to my work. sport clips is a chain of hair-cutting stores that are staffed by stylists mostly of the female species and the decor of the place is you guessed it, sport themed. i almost didn't give this place a shot, but went ahead and was surprised at the job my stylist did. it was like she had cut my hair for years and the best part of the experience was getting the wash and hot face towel/massage. that is something that i never been offered at my barber's place. give it a try. i have been to a few different stylists over the months and my favorite are in this order: alexa, celinda and diana. all do a great job for me and i am sure the others do too, i just haven't had a chance to try them yet."
"refused to cut my hair when i wouldn't give them my full telephone number.  it's a haircut, wtf"
"two-thumbs down!i'm a pretty clean cut guy with hair that's about as easy as it comes per cutting.  while everyone gets a crappy haircut once in a while...okay it happens, but....the lady that was butchering my hair didn't listen to a word i said when i told her how i wanted it cut!  i think she decided in her mind of minds how my hair would look best if she cut it how she felt.blah!my instructions were pretty complicated i guess, ""take about an inch off the top""translation for her i guess was, ""leave about an inch on top""blah again!"
got a haircut by briana. she was great and friendly. overall it was great and good hair cut. i've been going to sport clips for 3 years but never here. i will be back. only bad thing i have to say is that the sign in window said no wait and i waited 25 minutes for a haircut and but the time i left there were a lot of people waiting. all staff was friendly and good stylist. all the equipment was in good shape and store was very clean. if you don't mind waiting it's worth it.
cool place to get a good hair cut was in and out in a short amount of time.people were extremely nice and my do came out great.
"pretty nice place to get a haircut. the employees have a great attitude about working an good environment to get a haircut. although overall it is just a sportsclips. if youre picky about your hair, prolly not the best choice. but if youre looking for a basic cheap haircut then this is a very good choice for it."
sport clips in point loma is great!! all the ladies there are friendly and very helpful if you have any questions about the product they sell. great hair cuts and service!!
"sarah at the point loma shop was very friendly and explained everything to as a first time customer. i am used to an old school barber shop with an old school decor and vibe inside with old school hours (which made it hard for me to get in for hair cut due to my work schedule. i was in awe of atmosphere with tv's with sport on them all around you. i thought sarah was amazing as she took her time and made sure i was satisfied with my haircut and beard trim. it was nice to have soft gentle hands touch me vs the big rough n' brawly man hands of my old barber. the hot towel, shampoo wash with head massage was icing on the cake! definitely my new place for haircuts and i will be requesting sarah! it's nice to see a modern day barber shop for guy... sports clips is like a day spy designed for guys, love it!"
this place has become my go to for haircuts. every other place i've been to is hit or miss every time i go and just want to get you in and out as fast as possible. the staff here have all been very friendly and i've yet to be unhappy with a haircut. it feels very worth the extra two or three bucks for consistently perfect haircuts and great service.
"visited for my second time. first time was good, i was looking forward to becoming a regular. nice stylist, good haircut, close location to me, good value. i arrived today. it was busy with a customer in each chair. i signed in on the empty sign-in sheet and sat down knowing i would be next. then a guy comes in and says he was already signed in. a call out from the back... ""you will be next"". ok i suppose. he was here before me. then a second... then a third. same thing, 'i already signed in', 'ok, you'll be third'.if there was a sign-in sheet with three guys before me i could have determined if i wanted to wait or not... but to allow me to sit there for 15 minutes and announce one-by-one that others will be seen before me is simply insulting.either leave the filled up sign-in sheet there or tell the wanderers they lost their place because they left. you've lost a client."
"i like this chain, they have a good business model and provide good service for a decent price. i always go for the mvp treatment, which includes shampoo, head massage, hot towel and shoulder massage. this particular location does a great job. i've liked both the stylists i've had since moving to sd. parking has always been easy, and i've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes."
great long layers and face framing from one of the stylist. professional conversation and nice appearance from all the stylists.
"husband has gone to a sports clips once before, so we tried this location, i cannot describe how upset i am with the quality of the hair cut, two completely different lengths on top, my husband has a natural wave in his hair, and the hairdresser (natalie) thinned out his hair, causing the cut to look lopsided no matter what we attempt to do to fix it, and the fade isn't fully blended, the only way to make it even now would be a buzz cut. severely disappointed, not worth $22"
"nice people, the staff was great, friendly and professional, i got the mvp and i really liked how they wash your hair and do the massage after your cut, it made you feel cleaner after the cut, than getting it before, it removes all the sm.hairs so you are not itchy from them falling off your head and down your shirt on the way home.  i like the whole mvp experience!! i wish my hair grew faster so i could come more often."
"i don't understand why there are so many negative reviews, staff is always friendly, fast, and courteous.  my son always like this place, they have his hair cut preferences in there computer so it's always a quick chat as to what he wants, and if he changes it up every so often, it's never a problem.  i myself have long hair so i rarely get hair cuts, but when i do i come here, no expensive $60 price like other places that cut long hair, massage, wash, and good looking women, what else could the clientele want?also a couple times, i've come in with coffee and a danish just to watch tv while my wife did some grocery shopping next store, never an issue with the staff."
"there are actual experts giving the haircut. sarah was a professional who knew how to give me the haircut that could get that second look. also the products i was offered there to style my hair will last me as long as, if not longer, than my next dozen haircuts."
"i bring my son here for his haircuts. they do a great job. he likes coming here for the mvp experience. which is just a few dollars more for a shampoo, scalp massage, & hot towel. my son loves it!i would give them 5 stars if the service was better. it's been my experience that no one greets you when you walk in. you just sign in & wait. if the women were a bit more welcoming & friendly, it would be appreciated."
"this review is for johanna, and i meant to write it about a month ago. sports clips is decent as a franchise in general, where you can get a fairly decent cut at a fairly decent price. i have been to multiple locations, and pretty much go there when i don't want to spend the money on a more expensive cut, but have never been blown away by the experience. johanna was my last stylist, and she turned me into a loyal fan. first off, she actually cut my hair damn near perfectly in terms of what i wanted, and we had a great conversation about life. during this conversation, i learned of her dedication to the business and her owners where she works very hard and takes her job seriously. she dreams of owning her own franchise one day and i have no doubt she will make that happen. she is exactly the kind of person who takes a mundane business and adds layers of awesomeness to make you want to come back. bravo."
"back again for another haircut. wait was not too long, my stylist was very helpful and professional..."
rebekah gave a superb haircut per usual! she did exactly what was requested. scissor cut all around and a little longer in the front. she's always nice and pleasant. such relaxing mvp. we'll done.
"amazing job by every one of the girls who work here! always friendly and good service. i have had my hair cut by almost every person who works at this location and they all do a great job. michelle was my stylist today and it was great as always. happy with the service and the haircut. good conversation and a professional job, what more can you ask for.location is good, convenient and almost always parking available."
"johanna is the best! yes, i am a female that goes to sports clips. i followed johanna to this establishment once she stopped working at another salon. i go in about every two months for a trim. tuesday i went in and got several inches cut off so i got to go back in the locker room and get a wash, it was great! i loved the massage chairs with the hot towel on the face. also liked the hand held massager she used on my shoulders. men, if you're looking for a great place to get a haircut i recommend this location and ask for johanna. all of her customers look great & leave smiling once they're finished."
"great customer service and hardly ever a wait! this has quickly become my ""go to"" barbershop in san diego. the location is great, and the ladies do a fantastic job every time i come in for a visit. i've been going to sport clips consistently for the last three months and this one ranks up at the top. my first visit i was welcomed in with open arms and offered discounts for my military service. they are extremely military friendly here at this particular location. violeta was my first stylist, and she was near perfect. there are tons of great hair products here for men. if you want value size tea tree shampoo, this is your spot. there's a 66 fl oz bottle that will last you a few months if you're doing it right. like all sport clips, you have the option of getting your hair washed with a head massage, and a shoulder massage. this is known as the mvp. i don't know about you, but after a long day at work, a little relaxation like that goes a long way.i've only left this sport clips looking and feeling better than when i entered, so i'll be going back until that trend comes to an end."
"as a first timer i was offered a light massage and shampooing which worked seamlessly after a quick haircut. workers were professional and on point for each customer entering. the wait could be a problem, as a few gentlemen had come and left before my time arrived. worth the wait this time, but not so sure another. happy with my results."
"enjoy the mvp treatment. super friendly employees, great haircut. highly recommend."
"i've seen sportsclips around before but never went in to one. this place is great!  sports, sports, sports on all tvs. my stylist gave me the mvp treatment which includes a neck massage, hot towel facial, shampoo and haircut.  i felt like a new man when i left, and got several compliments on my cut. johanna, the manager, is the happiest most optimistic person i met in the service industry. i will be back."
"this place is "" absolutely amazing ""!  i've lived in rancho del rey for 18 years now and never knew the level of care and customer service they offered.  they treat you like royalty! the bar has been set sky high! i always judge a business from the moment i enter the doors and they get 5 stars across the board! a simple hair cut turned into a mini spa day! lourdes is awesome! she put a hot mint towel on my face as she washed my hair, followed by a quick back massage.  she not only had me looking good .... she also had me feeling rejuvenated!  i highly recommend this place.  you will not be disappointed!  plenty of bang for your buck! it's important to get great service these days.  #loyal #customer"
"hello ,since many years it was my son's favorite place,yesterday we went and the stylist lady refuse to give him a haircut saying he had to some  flakes, i show it to her it was from the excess of  gel ,my son felt very bad about it , she was not nice and she shouldn't do it,i will agree if somebody have a contiguous infection or so but not because of this,my son wash his hair every day .my son is 15 years old i will never go back to this place."
"this place is great! stopped while my wife was shopping. so friendly! my stylist jessie was fantastic. definitely my new spot for me and my songot in out quick, now i don't have to wait in the car while she shops! highly recommended"
"i bring my sons here (4 and 9). they don't sit still. at all. however, no matter who has cut their hair, they always leave looking perfect. i will say that the level of friendliness and professionalism has gone up exponentially the last time we went (may 2017). prior to this, grumpy was what you received with your great haircut. i highly recommend bridget. she is the opposite of grumpy. she engages with my boys and is bubbly and kind. we'll be back soon."
"today while in between business i took my son to have his hair cut. jennifer greeted us with a smile and interacted with my son very well.she asked me how i would like his hair cut, from his bangs, to his sides, the back & his little side burns.she was really friendly and inviting.she gave him the best haircut i have seen so far.we will be back !thank you jennifer!!!"
"i asked for a low fade with about a third cut off the top.  i also asked for the top to be rounded(dense curly hair) and a line-up. first the fade wasn't blended really at all. there were spots left off and the cut seemed to have no real attention to detail. the top was a mess. the woman who cut my hair scissor cut my hair barely combing it out, which was an alarming sign that this individual had limited experience on curly hair like mine. ultimately, it led to a very uneven cut on the top(my hair looked more like a triangle than rounded). the lineup was ultra fast and awful. the lady, instead of lining it up top to bottom, she lined it up bottom to the line if that makes sense. this just pushed my baby hairs back to make it seem like i recieved a lineup. the massage and the spa like treatment serves as a distraction to that sub-par(at best) haircut that you had just recieved. now i am not bashing on the lady. i do believe she did the best she could have with such limited experience, however it was mind boggling on the lack of detail assigned to this cut. i seriously recommend that there is extensive training on how to properly cut all types of hair. i will say that sports clips is a great place for anyone who probably isnt too concerned or their haircut isn't too demanding and for one to have a good hospitable environment to be surrounded by. by the way, my hair is fixed now by a barber who knows what they are doing so dont worry about me."
"this is not a place i plan on revisiting.  i took both my kids for haircuts. one of the stylists was friend and took the time to make sure his cut looked good, which is why they didn't just get one star.  my other son the stylist was not friendly and spent most of the time watching tv and not cutting hair. maybe she didn't like kids, but couldn't be bothered talking to him.  i felt like him being in her chair was a huge inconvenience. *someone reached out to apologize and my son asked to go back. the next visit was so much better!"
long wait times. come off peak hours so you don't sit and wait. this place is where to go when your son out grows the kid salon  pigtails & crewcuts.
i recently went here and got my haircut and they did a great job. they did it in a timely fashion and were very helpful.
"i can only vouch for jessica she knows how to cut hair. she is bomb and i don't mind waiting for her to cut my sons hair. it's a decent price, fair for eastlake. my son is super particular too, so this is a major recommendation."
"this place sucks. the women are rude, they suck at cutting hair and they'll expect a huge tip for the nothing they barely do. most recently, the event that provoked me to write this review, is when i took my children (i have two boys and one girl) to this shop hoping they'd cut my daughters hair the way she wants (she's in middle school but identities as a boy, which should be respected by everyone) and i got denied service! i repeat, they denied me service flat out. when i asked to talk to a manager, i was told by the manager that they don't cut female hair, & when i tried to explain the situation i got asked to leave. it's 2015, approaching 2016 and my transgender daughter got refused service. this place is disgusting and i will boycott it until the day i die."
from when you first walk in you're greater and tended to immediately. you notice right away this is not your typical barber/ hair salon. everyone there is really nice and they offer a variety of services to meet anyone's needs. i recommend any guy to go there. once yougo there you'll never want to get your hair cut anywhere else.
"i give five stars for one stylist who always does a great job cutting my hair and doesn't make pointless conversation. for me jessica is the best. i can sit in silence and watch whatever game is on tv. she remembers how i like my hair and gets it done quick and clean. i don't want to be friends with my hair stylist, i just want them to cut my hair.sheena is good too, but i wouldn't chance anyone else. i've had some bad cuts here with other stylist. no matter where you go there are always a few bad apples."
"so my job took me away from my home town sd where i was born and raised and i started using sports clips in az and loved it. great customer service which is odd because az is not known for customer service at all people hate their lives in az and it reflects in their service in most things. but the service was better, the haircuts were better and the price was less if i remember correctly. now we're near $30 for an mvp which is pathetic because you get 2 minuntes if youre lucky of a massage you spend and extra $10 for and the customer service from this elderly lady (my age 50+) was horrid the buzz cut i got was worse the the $5 buzz cuts i used to get in the navy. i changed a year ago from sportsclips eastlake due to subpar cuts and horrid waste of money 2 minute massages that aren't worth it to gent's corner by the mall. i had a couple shady cuts there until i met patrick and his cuts have been flawless every time. so, i say it's a new year sportsclips sent me $5 off so 22 vice 27 woohoo im treating myself to an mvp. biggest mistake of this new year.  first don't bother paying for the mvp if you come here it's not ever been worth it here and second if you want a real haircut you might as well go somewhere where they care about what they're doing because this lady certainly didn't care about me or my hair.  good riddance!"
"walked in with my husband and two boys  and stood in the front for about 5 min. nobody greeted us. decided to sit in waiting area. still no acknowledgement at all. there were four girls cutting hair and not a single one even smiled at us or said hello. i understand they were busy but there was a very unfriendly vibe. would it hurt to acknowledge a customer and say ""we will be right with you"" ??? walked out after 10 minutes and won't be back."
"i took my son to this sports clips, i had been to one before, but told myself i would never go there again because the service was horrible and so was the cut. i decided to give it another shot and i am so glad that i did! jessica, i believe that's her name, was so amazing. my son was nervous about getting his haircut there again, but this time was different. my son cannot wait to go back and i just wanted to take the time to let sports clips know that if it wasn't for her, i wouldn't return. see you soon jessica, i told all my friends to come find you!"
i was hoodwinked. first time i went in there as a new customer i was given the royal treatment and upgraded for free. i tipped $15 and subsequently three other haircuts after that i tip $10 each time based on a decent job. my last haircut prior with denise was fine but overall friendliness with conversation was void for some reason. i tipped her $5 and felt guilty. i go in three days ago request sheena while waiting probably 30 minutes as i was next in line and she proceeded to take another customer who could have gone with another stylist about 1 minute later and i ended up waiting even longer. i walked out vowing never to return. i did call sheena and she apologized but obviously i wasn't of any priority or importance...even though i've been loyal. something happened to the overall friendliness in that place as i became just a number i suppose.
"kinda disappointed...came here for a trim a few months ago and a barber (stylist?) named jaimee killed it. gave me a phenomenal haircut which just adds to my disappointment when 2 months later, a different lady cuts my hair and leaves my bangs too long then i go in a few days later to get it touched up and now my bangs are too short!! i look like shit. i'm gonna have to buzz my head to look halfway decent now. they touched it up for free, so at least they have good customer service but i recommend calling ahead to get a stylist you like cuz you're kinda playing russian roulette w/your hair here."
"worst haircut by far! i could have give myself this haircut! there were two ladies in there and 3 clients walked in and none of them sat those people. literally those guys waited about 20 minutes to sit in a chair! i paid 22 bucks for something i could have done, i asked for a shorter haircut because i was growing my hair out for a specific cut, and she buzzed my head! worst by far!"
"worse service ever! my husband took my son yesterday for the first time, and this lady with blonde hair (i wish i had her name) was the most unprofessional, and rude person ever! i don't know why she is working on this field where you need to have good costumer service. as soon as they walked in, she looked like she didn't want to be there, not even a little smile...never going back."
"fast, efficient, and great cuts! web check-in is a plus. helen is one of the best i've had cut my hair but can say that i've never had a bad cut from anyone there. (although i've had a few at other establishments...)"
"very good, if it's slow.if you check in online, expect to wait if they get busy in the interim. if you find a good stylist, stay with them. there is high variability in the quality of the haircut and experience depending on who you get. i checked in online and then waited 28 minutes beyond the recommended arrival time. while i was waiting, the chatter amongst the unoccupied staff was a bit annoying. speaking about relationships and other personal information i'd rather not have heard. this was among the stylists who did not have customers. i really don't need to hear about someone's relationship issues loudly spoken for the whole room to hear. anyway, i used up my last season ticket today and i must say, the haircut quality is above average. however, the waiting time and the drama i don't need. i wish this facility all the best. i'd recommend you let people book appointments so they aren't wasting time waiting. if you're afraid of wasted appointments, make the client place a non-refundable down payment to book."
"i continue to go here. in fact, i got a haircut yesterday. the new online check in works well. when i got to the store, i didn't have to check in again. i was able to choose my haircutter (jenny) and i received a time that i should show up at the store. worked pretty dang well. i was also able to add a guest to my ticket (through online checkin), which is nice. i added my son, who went right after me. it was his first haircut at sports clips and jenny did a terrific job. my son says that he no longer wants his mom to cut his hair! i guess that's that. anyhow, the old manager is still at this location. she still doesn't seem very happy. and i still get the feeling that employees are more at ease and happy when she isn't there. i hope that manager finds happiness in her life!"
"i have been going to this location since it opened. i have seen a gradual decline in service and a not so gradual incline in the price. i had always requested a ""triple play"" cut which was slightly lower in price than the mvp because the 3 minute back massage to me was not worth it.on my last visit i was told that the triple play was no longer an option and it would either be a haircut for $22 or mvp for $27.  after the computerized checkout kiosk suggests a tip, we're talking $32.i am not sure if other sportclip locations are following suit, but this will be my last visit here. the stylists are nice but i think the management does not understand that customer choice is important."
"love the mvp - it's an experience- after the haircut you get a relaxing shampoo in a massage chair with a steamed towel on your face, and neck and shoulder massage with a professional grade massage machine. all the stylists do a great job. i always stop in for a free neck trim in between haircuts too. this place is the real deal!"
"this is by far the best ""barber shop"" i have been to. i have lived in scripps ranch for 18 years now and this is the only place i will ever get my haircut at. the customer service is superb and all of the employees are extremely friendly and i have even made close friends with some of the employees. the place is always extremely clean and i get the pleasure of watching sports while i am getting my hair cut. my favorite barber is lola as she has years of experience and you can tell she knows exactly what you want and will work with you to ensure you are satisfied by the end of the haircut. i would and do recommend this place to anyone and everyone in the area or just visiting. i love you lola!"
we won't be going here anymore.  all the good stylists are gone.   we've had numerous experiences here where a every stylist insists that they can cut black hair but that's not true. my son's hair has been lined up crookedly or with uneven lengths in his hair.   the last time a stylist had to have the manager finish and fix my son's haircut.  i guess these ladies cannot admit their own limitations.  this week we called a day in advance and came during the hours they told us the manager donna would be there and when we got there we were told the she was leaving early and could not cut my son's hair.  she was still there and insisted that anyone could do it.  not true and so unprofessional.  so having had so many bad experiences here at scripps location we left without a hair cut.  so disappointing to have such bad customer service from a manager.  you just lost a customer.
complete shit.does not listen.  does not now what a fade is either.  took a 1 all the way up to the crown.  paid 25 dollars for something a lawnmower didwent home and buzzed it off.do not come here!!!
service at this location is really a hit or miss. you either get a good haircut with a good barber - or in my most recent case - someone who can barely speak english and completely butchers your haircut. i'm not sure who i had - but they literally like did what they thought they wanted even after i told them what i wanted. completely screwed up my hair and i don't recommend here.
"i love coming to sport clips. i have had the same person a couple of times, but it's always a great experience no matter what. love the mvp as well!"
"i came here on saturday april 30th to get my haircut (obviously, that's why i went).  it was mid-day and it was what you would expect for the level of business for that time of day and for being the weekend.  i had been here a couple times before with no complaints and my complaint isn't necessarily with the establishment itself because i've been to another location and have had great experiences.  my complaint is specifically with the manager which just so happened to be the person cut my hair.  from the very get go my experience was horrible.  the stylist said hi, but didn't smile. we proceeded to talk about what i had wanted and i had even showed her a picture.  she didn't say anything and kind of looked at me like i wasn't making sense so i had asked her if she understood because she didn't respond to what i was talking about.  from there the service was just downhill.  i looked around and saw all the other stylists engaging their patrons.  mine didn't say one word to me.  she looked flustered.  i don't know if she was having a bad day or if it was normal for her to be so rude.  but....it got worse.  she rushed through my haircut and it was absolutely an awful haircut.  i prefer scissors but she used a buzzer and comb.  she was slamming her cupboards.  she was extremely rough with my head and was pulling at my hair an unwarranted amount.  she didn't smile.  half way through she asked my what i was up to for the day but it seemed forced.  i was so irritated that it was difficult for me to answer the question.  i wanted the vip treatment but after my haircut i was so done with her that i cancelled it and just wanted to pay and go.  i asked the clerk at the counter if i could speak with the manager and she just pointed to the lady who cut my hair.  really?  that's the manager!?  what a horrible role model and leader you are for your staff members.  i complained to the assistant manager outside who was incredibly nice and heard my concerns.  to the manager:  have some pride in what you do.  if not find another line of work.  be a leader and show your co-workers how to engage with other customers the right way.  all your other stylists looked like they were having fun - take some notes from them.   the assistant manager encouraged me to come back for a free haircut but honestly i don't know if i'll be back to that location.  the manager should be fired."
"no matter what location i go too, i always get treated like an mvp which i love. sport clips will always be one of my favorite hair cut spots, i get to watch sports center while getting my haircut, add on a hot steam towel, back massage as well as a head rub and you got yourself a happy camper. thanks for always making my experience great! i definitely recommend coming and getting the mvp experience if you have yet to try it out, you will thank me later."
"beware/avoid: the little old ill mannered hot tempered lady (aka the manager).came in saturday, june 4th to get  my 20-month old son's head shaved. the barber was friendly, and i want to make it clear this review is not about the barber, but directed to her ill-mannered manager. the barber nipped my sons scalp. it bled, but ok let's move on because my son was crying from the top of his lungs, and it would have been hard for any barber. the barber was apologetic, and said she will see what the mgr can do about it. the staff tried to help the situation w lollipops, balloons, etc.finally, they rang me up full price. so i asked the reception what was the verdict between the barber and the mgr? she was timid in answering and had the mgr talk to me. this little old lady who is in her late 40s-50s came charging at me with words loaded like a machine gun....'there is always risk in shaving a child's head without a guard...and even more so with the way your son was acting!"" she just kept coming at me repeating what she said in variations. her words, tone, and attitude completely threw me off my game... what happened to the nice staff i was dealing with?! there was almost no end in her verbal regurgitation... so i finally put my foot down and told her straight out - i specifically asked what are the dangers to shaving with a 0 (no guard), and the barber told me there is no danger at all, she does this all the time, and she too has a 6 month old baby at home so she knows what it's like....this hot headed mgr finally softened up a little and said well i didn't know you asked the barber all those questions but still there are still risks , and continued her rant. i said listen i asked all the questions i needed to ask to ensure my sons safety and if you say there is no danger at all then i believe you because as a female i have never had to shave my own head before and i trust what you as a professional says. she turns to the receptionist and says what do you want to do?? the receptionist said she will remove $5 from the cut. the little old ill mannered hot tempered mean lady said that's too much for a nip! and threw a coupon at the receptionist for $2 off , and turned to me and said ""well at least he looks cute!"" damn old manager lady! you are lucky your entire staff is nice ! i don't know how you are in the business of consumer service with no idea what customer service is. you didn't have to give me a discount, just don't give me grief. i would have been fine with an apology , compassion, or a grain of sympathy . any type of lip service would have made any mother whose son was bleeding on the scalp feel better. but you thought it be appropriate to put the blame back on my son, and my ignorance of what no guard meant... and that is why you will always be that little old ill mannered hot temper lady cutting hair.  i pity you!"
we love this sport clips location. the staff and manager are always friendly. my boys get super cute cuts and they treat their customers with respect!
"after sitting there for 20 minutes and seeing people start to go ahead of me i asked how many more appointments there were before me, a walk in, would get a haircut. apparently there is a sign in sheet to get service?! how amature is that? not greeted by anyone and definitely not told i had to sign in to get service...i am sorry this is my first visit here, but seriously how about, ""good morning, are you here for a haircut? make sure to sign in...""but no, now i have wasted my lunch hour on a fruitless journey to sport clips...the minor leagues of hair cut establishments."
"been here a few times, but exceptionally poor service when i was in this morning. no acknowledgement, no estimate of wait time, particularly if you're going to call people before me that came in after. i understand if they called ahead or something, but you need to open your mouth and communicate."
nora is the best i am so glad she is back.  she makes my haircuts last months. i have cowlicks so most people make my hair do crazy things when there done.  nora your the best keep up the hard work.
great place for haircuts! my son and husband both go to fiona for haircuts and she does a great job. i like that i can call when i'm on my way so we don't have sit and wait.
"alright fellas.  i usually like to keep my reviews a little more lighthearted and anecdotal but let's skip the foreplay and get down to business.  just the facts.i've been coming to this sports clips for about 3 years now so it's safe to say i like coming here.  i'm always greeted with a friendly smile by the young lady at the front desk.  99% of the time i get my haircut by nora.  nora's very friendly and easy going but don't let her laid back persona fool you.  she cares about her craft and wants to make sure my haircut comes out great and that i am satisfied with the cut.  the other 1% of the time when nora isn't available, i go with a stylist she knows that is working and i am just as happy.if you want to know how the location looks inside, look at any of their commercials.  it's spot on.  tvs everywhere!  in the waiting room.  at each stylist station.  in the bathroom.  ok maybe not the bathroom.  but you get the idea.  they keep the floors and stations clean at all times.  my recommendation is to get the season tickets which gives me 6 mvp experiences (haircut, steamed towel, shampoo, shoulder massage) for the price of 6 varsity cuts (standard haircut).  makes the checkout quick and easy.yelp tip: call in about 15 minutes before you get there to put your name down on the list.  this will save you some wait time if they are busy."
"this place is great!  i have been going here for a few years now and always get a good haircut.  nora has been my go to and she never disappoints!!  they provide a great full service mens haircut.if your looking to get fancy and dye your gray hair or something, this is not that type of place!  great people, haircut, and mvp."
"i have been going to sports clips for the past 8 years and to this particular one for the past 4. as far as sports clips go this is the best i have been to. i like the stylists here a lot (i have tried several and they are all great) and they are very nice to students (even offering a $5 discount with ucsd id). it can be a little pricey and sometimes there can be a bit of a wait (~30 min max usually) but it is worth the time! the mvp haircut is very relaxing and is a nice way to treat yourself after studying hard for a midterm or staying up all week to do homework. overall, i usually walk out very satisfied with my haircut and happy with the service."
great service and consistently good haircut. very happy with the service i've received here. i'm a regular. i really appreciate the way this place is run and managed.  it's top notch.
"i went here for a walk-in appointment and got their mvp option. i was fourth on the list, so at first i was tempted to try again another day, but i figured i had time to wait. turns out it was a pretty short wait! less than 20 minutes. these guys are fast, friendly, and skilled enough to do a quality cut in 30 minutes or less."
"the location is clean and looks like every other spirt clips. staff are friendly enough, but i feel like they rush through the mvp experience. my haircut is always good, though. i've sometimes had to wait a bit to be served: even though they seem to rush through service, they seem to dawdle between clients. that might be a misimpression on my part due to the fact i happened to arrive during a shift change today, but even though there were four stylists present, for a while i was the only person being served while several people were stacking up in the waiting area."
great place for a quick cut and a good styling! i went to this place for 5+ years and without a hitch was happy every time i went and have them show you the cut book.
"worst haircut i've gotten in my life. period. i even showed her a picture of a past haircut that i've gotten that i was going for, or something similar to it. it wasn't even close. when i asked her to fix the side/front, she literally snipped off a chunk of my hair. asked her to fix the back of my hair, whatever she did, it was either unfixable or she doesn't know what it means to 'fix' anything about my hair.went there on saturday february 18th in the evening, didn't even bother to remember her name because i'd hate to put anyone in a spot that'll ruin her career, but i just want her and the management to know that first, she did a really bad job, and second, she was unprofessional. when i say unprofessional, it doesn't mean that she was 'rude', but like she spent more time trying to convince me how good of a job she was doing, rather than really taking the time to understand what i was going for.never going back."
never again - hairdresser was resistant to doing what i wanted. a extra star given for managers attempt of offering a free redo. did not go again though.
"decent wait. great haircut. was able to get a free shampoo, hot towel, and massage since it was my first time."
omg awful!! the lady smelled like cigarettes and was very unprofessional. uneven haircut .. now have to pay someone else to fix it.
not very good. fade was ok but i asked the girl to only take a half an inch off and she completely butchered the top. if you're looking for a fade you're probably ok but if you want a hair cut you might want to look for a professional. completely no bueno~
"went on a wednesday at 10:45 am. wasn't too busy, but still a 5-10 minute wait since there were only two people working. kiki was the one who cut my hair, she was nice and asked me if the way she cut it looked good. and for first time customers i got a free upgrade to the mvp, which included haircut, shampoo, heated towel on the face, and a shoulder massage. overall a pretty good experience, the cut was not bad either. took around 15 minutes total."
"always a wait, but this place offer so many perks it's hard to ignore. free touch-ups is the biggest convenience because i grow neck hair like a grizzly bear. the shampoo and massage is really nice and tvs means i don't miss a game. hope they have the game you want though because all the tvs are tuned to the same channel. they also have high quality products at pretty decent prices if you're low on conditioner or pomade. problem is always the wait and sometimes the stylists can be subpar."
"what can i say about this place other than, my stylist kiki is the only reason i come here. i followed her when she moved to this location, despite it being a considerable distance from my house; she's that good! kiki absolutely makes this place! she's funny, professional, and does an amazing job every time. if you are considering this sport clips, ask for kiki, she is a notch above. this place is fortunate to have someone like her working there... she is the only reason i drive as far as i do to frequent this establishment, and i couldn't be happier with her as my stylist!"
"short version:1) ignore the decor because this place is not just for men!!!2) ask for mary- she is a therapist, a stylist and a hair professor all in one.3) my sisters, you will want to weep openly for the super spa treatment you receive for a pittance compared to what you've been getting at ""salons.""4) despite the bargain basement prices, do not skimp on the tip.long version:i walked in here with my guy to wait for his trim and when i heard that the mvp came w/ hot towel, face and neck massage and massage shampoo for $24 and for $5 more you would get 2 for 1, i was like ""can i get that?""  oh sure, said mary, the helpful patient lady at the front desk.and then i said ""i'm ready to cut it all off."" mary suggested i look up a photo before she went for the clippers. so i found something decent- she looked at it and said- ""ok, you are going all the way. we'll take it slow and see how you like it."" she then spent a good long time giving me a great haircut, tweaking it periodically and adjusting until it was just right. and then i got the double double- two shampoos w/ aromatic product, head rub, and two hot towels applied w/ face massage all while i was in a vibrating massage chair. no, that has never happened to me. it was magical.  then i got the neck and shoulder rubdown w/ a massage machine.not only the treatment, i got schooled while my hair got tamed. did you know you need to train your hair? that applying product to wet or dry hair produces different effects? i picked up a good deal of info on my hair and how to deal with it. yup. i went from long to short with a totally unknown stylist at a mall chain and you know what- it was the best thing that ever happened to me or my hair.  that fancy $100 salon experience with slightly disdainful ""stylists"" (you know who you are) is a thing of the past for me. i'll look past the locker room wallpaper and sports broadcasts- or better yet, i'll close my eyes and let mary work her magic while i relax."
i use to go here often but today was plain awful. i waited for 15 minutes with my name first in line to only get bypassed by two other people with name lower than mine. why they wouldn't take me borders on racism. not recommended
"this was my first visit to any sports clips. i went at 1:00 pm and there was hardly any wait. my stylist's name was loan and she was very friendly. she upgraded me to the mvp haircut without me having to ask. it includes haircut, hot towel, shampoo, and shoulder massage. she made sure i was comfortable and that she was cutting my hair the way i liked."
"**my review reflects the service i have been receiving from one of the hair stylists and has nothing to do with my overall satisfaction with this place. **last time i went there jenny cut my hair. haircut was ok but her trimmer injured my neck and actually it was burning and red when i came home with sign of blood on the napkin i used to disinfect my neck. my poor luck this time ended up with her again and didn't want to be rude and ask for another stylist. and same bad unacceptable attitude and did the same thing to my neck. i simply said "" your trimmer seems to be too sharp and rough on skin"" her reply "" you always complain, next time ask for another stylist"". she was very rude and insulting. i have been going to this place for over five years and will keep going because i like everybody else over there but would never get a haircut with her again!!"
"overpriced for the quality of cut. in terms of technical skills, christina did not seem at all comfortable handling the clippers or scissors. she gave me a 1 on the sides and a 5 up top which is what i asked for, but her inability to blend between the two lengths confirms a lack of training. in terms of professionalism, she came off as defensive when i politely asked her to adjust the shape of my cut. during the attempted adjistment, her fidgety scissor technique managed to pluck a few of my hairs all while explaining to me how 90% of their clients ask for a haircut the correct way. it was at this moment i knew i would not come back. can't speak for the other barbers, but would not risk it regardless."
"i asked for a fohawk. after all the fade and adjustment, the lady shaves off like a tiny bit of the front part of my hair right in the middle right above the forehead. now its growing and it looks like a little hanger dangling off. now its short and stiff, so no hair product could fix this either. its been like this for about 6 months now. never going back here again."
"good haircut, very convenient and price is reasonable for the services provided (higher end men's haircut). christina did an excellent job."
"i was in desperate need of a trim, christina was very helpful and took it slow and made sure to remove my dead ends while keeping the length and style i wanted. she recommended a conditioning leave in spray that she used on me during the cut and i purchased it because it smelled so good and made my hair feel super soft."
"the last two times i've been in have me never wanting to return. it's obviously not a good time to show up at 7 pm. they are all tired and just want to be done. i was barely acknowledged and the kiosk said 10 min. two stylish there both finishing cuts. at 12 min in one finished. she collected fee and then disappeared into the back. then 10 min later she apparently had gone into the back to eat. she was still chewing as she was now cleaning up her station! still did not acknowledge me as i got up to leave. so, i guess i'm back to the la mesa one. puzzles me why none of the stores are managed or zero ownership present. one mvp always on the search of better treatment....."
all i have to say is trina is incredible. professional and one of the best haircuts i ever had the pleasure of getting. do yourself a favor and head on in and ask for trina. your welcome.
"kori is amazing - provides great customer service and she is wonderful - always happy to see us. we found her by walking in about 4 yrs ago due to a bad cut for my son and she fixed it and since that episode my son who is now 12 yrs old would not go to get hair cut from anyone else just from kori  thank you sport clips for having such an amazing person with skills and great personality working for your company and having her in santee location, thank you stepanka and eddie hastings"
"the best haircut i have ever had. the stylist, chris, made me feel like a million bucks. great place. excellent treatment and super stylist. i'm going back, for sure."
"updating my review because it's just not fair to judge a business on a single bad experience. i've had so many other positive visits here, and i will continue to come and visit my regular stylist kori. she is outstanding, and in the future will just wait as long as it takes to get my hair cut by her. thanks to the manager for reaching out to make this right."
didn't get a hair cut for my son after waiting 30 minutes even though he was next merely because we felt uncomfortable taking the girls time. i know we walked in at 7:30p and the girls were exhausted but that's the only time we have to get these chores done after i've worked along day and my kids are finished with sports. the two girls seemed more annoyed and bothered by our business than pleasant to serve us. it was really uncomfortable. we won't be returning
i came in at 3 and didn't leave till 4 when there was only 2 people ahead of me and the service was horrible they took no time to check on their work.
service was quick. i had a regular haircut which was sort of pricey for no shampoo option. i would recommend shopping around
"lost me! you do a decent haircut, but really the damned kiosk that won't let you sign in without email, phone, address?  screw that!  i need a haircut, not more crap in my inbox!"
"my husband loves this place and describes it as such (i can vouch for him):- friendly ladies... great conversationists.- fast... cuts never lasted more than 15 minutes- consistant... good cuts every time- good price... military discount!- no bs... you get your cut and you're donethey also show you that they sterilize everything at your first visit. they have a rewards program for those who get hair cuts all the time as well. my husband bypasses all other barbers to come here for his military cut... he really likes the no hassle... you're in and out. he isn't even a football fan (but i am, i love going with to watch the sports networks.) they have a big screen for the waiting area. works fine with me. sometimes i wish they took longer with his haircut haha.seriously, the best you can get out there for consistent, no hassle, in and out haircuts. 5 stars."
always a fun time going in there. great stylists and make sure i get the style i want
"recently took my 11 year old in for a hair cut. i really like the new way to check in. our wait wasn't to long. in the end, he had a really great, clean cut."
"great haircut and great service. a bit more than i was used to, but worth it. i especially love that they do free neck trim between haircuts. i'm definitely coming back here."
"jessica is awesome!! super-talented, always cheerful, & does a fantastic job for my boys.  she gets pretty busy, but she's worth the wait : )!"
"the experience was amazing for my boys. they are 8&7 but felt like ""men"" as they watched sports and got pampered. trina was so patient and worked around their movement as they could not stay still. she made them feel so comfortable and talked with them as well as made them laugh. :) we will be back and will be recommending this location to all of our friends!"
"i always have a great experience here, and my haircuts come off perfect.  trina is quick with the experience, and you can tell by how she cuts she's an expert.  i've gone elsewhere and the stylists seem lost, and make mistakes.  the amenities here speak for themselves of you're a sports lover.  once a month i visit, never disappointed.  docked one star for the price, but that's life in 'merica, everything up-charged based on what people are willing to pay."
wish i could give no stars. horrible customer service and a mediocre haircut at best. the place looks decent but i didn't go there to watch tv. there are so many other places to go. stay away from this joke of a barbershop.
my 14 year old went today and got a horrible cut.  his stylist must be drunk.  not even close to straight.  i would post a picture if i could.  he is traumatized and has to go to school and be the subject of ridicule.  this could be a life shaping event for a high schooler.
"my sweetheart has been going to the same barber for over 15 years but one day he was near the santee sports clips and decided to give it a try. i don't think he'll be going anywhere else. friendly, personable barbers give great cuts, and the scalp massage is to write home about!"
pam is an incredible stylist who always cuts my hair the perfect length!i always enjoy going to this location as everyone is friendly and super professional!
"it had been over 6 or so years since the last time i tried out a sports clips. i stopped going to this chain because the quality was so inconsistent. unlike supercuts which is guaranteed mediocrity, sports clips is bi-polar. amazing, or terrible.. but i've started to try this place out again. i came in late afternoon (3pm) and the wait was only 5 minutes. the cut was great...i came back a month later and someone else cut my hair..the cut was terrible..- enough with the attitude if you don't put your phone number on the wait list. - enough with blacking out the windows so you can't tell if it's busy or not from the street.- inconsistency, it's a sports clips thing..risk / reward... i think i'll stick with mediocrity with supercuts."
"my son was really pissed-off after his barber lady simply used a ""military style"" too short & zero style clipper cut this past friday afternoon. she didn't deserve her two-dollar tip..."
"a bit intimidating at first walking into this masculating steroid wonderful customer experience. they are accommodating and try everything to make it right. too bad a handful of people who live in del mar feel privileged and give them a hard time. this place has a good system going on, just pop your name onto a computer and it'll give you a wait time that shows up on a tv screen. come 5 minutes earlier than the expected time and you're ready to go."
"anne is hands down the best stylist i've ever had. i recently moved to los angeles and still schedule my haircuts around the times when i visit sd just to get my hair cut with her--no one else really compares. she always greets me with a smile and she knows exactly what to do to make my hair look great. the first time i got my hair cut with her she gave me a play-by-play and asked me questions to make sure she was doing what i wanted. after that first cut, she's never had to ask again because she has my full trust. the other stylists are very friendly as well. the place is usually very clean and the wait times aren't too long. highly recommended!"
"after years of seeing ads for the sport clips franchise in airline magazines whenever i traveled for business, and being fascinated by the concept of a haircut place geared towards guys, i was excited to try them out when sport clips entered the san diego market.  nearly a decade later, i am still a loyal fan.over the years, i've visited nearly every location throughout the county but continued to remain loyal to the location closest to my home until a year or two ago when i could no longer take the deterioration of the brand at that other location.  while that other location certainly had the sport clips look and branding, the ""feel"" and ""vibe"" were gone and, after taking a seat in the chair, you felt like you were sitting in the stereotypical nail salon where all of the workers were talking, gossiping and griping amongst themselves.  i was at my breaking point and even considered returning to my college days of frequenting supercuts.  before going down that path, i decided to hop on yelp and check out the other sport clips locations.  i'm glad i did because that connected me with sport clips del mar and the amazing crew they have there.venturing in that first day and being greeted with their trademark ""welcome to sport clips"" (something the other location had long ago abandoned or forgotten about) put a smile on my face.  i was sold.  although there are two other locations closer to my home, i continue to go out of my way to visit this location every month and they have earned my loyalty visit after visit.in looking at the other reviews, a number of commenters complained about the previous waiting system and them being ""passed over"" for other clients.  the previous system used a clipboard where you would sign in and wait just like every other location.  confusion might arise when someone would sign in, find out there was a 45 minute wait, go next door for a sandwich and return in time to reclaim their place in line.  when that client was called next, the other people waiting in the lobby thought that the client had jumped ahead of them.  that problem no longer exists.recently, this location invested a lot of time, money and training to implement a new tablet based sign in system.  with the new system, you sign in on a tablet, select your preferred stylist, if you have one, and you receive an estimated wait time.  the flatscreen tv on the wall displays where you are in the ""line up,"" how long your wait is and who is next ""on deck.""  while the new system took some getting used to, it is an awesome addition and has seemed to alleviate a lot of the confusion i used to witness sitting in the lobby while i waited.in the real estate business, they talk about location, location, location.  location is great but what matters in the service industry, is service.  despite being one of, if not the most established sport clips location in san diego county, the ownership at the del mar location has not forgotten its roots nor the sport clips brand - they remember the sport clips motto - ""it's good to be a guy!""while any owner can put together a nice, clean and shiny store, what sets this location apart from the others i visited is the staff and the management's dedication to retaining stylists who believe in the brand and the sport clips concept.  although every stylist i have encountered believes in the brand and treats the client like an all-star, one stylist in particular, is the store's mvp - brittney w.  brit's consistency and attention to detail are always spot on and she treats every client, whether they are a first timer or a longstanding client, like they are the most important client there.  brit - keep doing what you're doing... you make the store what it is!"
have been a fan of sports clips for over 8 years. this is an awesome location! kiri is incredible! you won't regret it!!
this is a nice place with friendly people. kiri cut my hair and she did a great job! all the girls there were very nice. i was in n out in no time. thanks!
"this review is for the stylist, not the location. pam is the best... hands down. attention to detail, genuine care and concern and overall great attitude is what keeps me coming back every three weeks. only a matter time until she opens her own studio with the demand she has, so make sure to see her soon! you won't be disappointed."
my barber was unable to take me due to illness for a few months so i was on the search to find a great haircut. luckily i contacted brittney and there was no wait time at all. right off the bat she asked me how i wanted it cut and she was done in less than 20 minutes. great haircut and fantastic personality! see you next month brittney!
"i don't like sports. unless you count combat sports, i suppose.. but on paper i have absolutely no reason to be in this very.. 'macho' oriented place. i don't follow baseball, basketball, football, hockey, etc, etc.  that being said, i am a creature of habit.. and after having a 'falling out' with my previous barber of 7 years (he was refusing to do what i was asking him to), i needed a new hair stylist. on a complete whim whilst in my local shopping mall, i thought to myself 'wouldn't it be hilarious if i ended up getting my hair cut at sportclips?'. so i walked in, and fate introduced me to brittney. she's charming, charismatic, and actually passionate about what she does - the most admirable trait in anyone, which makes the the inner-turmoil i feel whilst being bombarded by sports-related messaging so much easier to manage. everyone else who works here seems nice too, but specifically i cannot recommend brittney enough. even if you're like me and avoid the sports media at all costs, they do a good job of making you feel comfortable here."
"i like this place! i come in about once a month and i usually get clipped up by a lady named kiri. she's friendly and professional and the place is always clean, and cool on those hot days. sometimes too cool, but that's better than too hot when you're sitting in the chair. prices are fair and i've never had a bad cut there, so i'll keep coming back."
"great haircuts, awesome crew products and a super friendly staff. taylor castillo is the best out there!"
"all smiles here. brittney just killed it again with an awesome haircut & mvp! it certainly doesn't hurt that she also works quickly, is an engaging conversationalist, and doesn't get overwhelmed/distracted even when the salon gets incredibly busy. such a positive experience overall."
epic service once again today by britney. she is the only stylist i've seen for the past three years and was actually one of her first customers. mvp is the way to go and make sure to ask for britney!
"diana is not only drop dead gorgeous and pleasant, but a great haircutter to boot. get a shampoo from her. her fingers are magic."
typically i can drop in and be seen in less that 15 min. the cuts are good and the providers are professional.
"unpleasant experience this morning, and nothing to do with the wait time of 45 minutes. stylist started off ok, shaved my sides and back of neck area. then, she asked if she could do something to the two areas on either side at the top of my head, because they look 'elongated' and it made me look like a conehead. being that i'm close to 50 and no longer have the hair of a 20-year old, i shrugged and said i'm kind of used to it at this point, no biggie. stylist went on to say - not once, not even twice - but three times said ""if you don't care about your hair that's your problem, but as your stylist.. "" and went on with some self-prophecizing rant. i had to say ""i didn't say i didn't care"", but didn't want the situation to blow out any further. when it was time to checkout, sportsclips' pinpad offers $5 as the minimum tip - more than 20% - so you have to hit the other button for a different amount, which i did. i still tipped her, of course, but it'll be the last time this location sees my business."
"i've been going to the del mar, ca location for sometime now and very happy with them. professional staff and my stylist ""diana"" always takes the time to make sure hair comes out perfect. always kept clean and just a pleasant visit."
"nice people but i got botched like never before. stick to barber shops, twice the talent for half the price."
"amazing service!  the shop is super clean, and the staff is very friendly. even at 9am, they make you feel like you are at home. i'll keep coming back here. the mvp is something to die for. i mean those good chairs put me right to sleep, and those massages are the bomb. you guys rock! i won't be going anywhere else in the city but here. thank you for an amazing experience!"
"i initially came to this location because of its' proximity to my work but what made me a returning customer was their excellent service. throughout my returning visits i have consistently received great haircuts and customer service, specifically by kay and liz.    this location is great if you're looking for knowledgeable and friendly staff, who clearly care about their profession. i always look forward to my next visit!"
"love this place and kay is the best but the whole staff is great too. friendly, reasonable and typically pretty fast."
visited this location yesterday for the first time. had the pleasure of getting an mvp haircut from liz. definitely recommend her & i'll be going back! the hot towel and scalp treatments are second to none!
kay is awesome and they always take care of me :) i definitely recommend picking up some tea tree product for your hair and getting the mvp. always a nice conversation and professional staff. i highly reccommend this location!
"first time customer here. it was definitely unique to any local barber shop i've ever been to.  if it's your first time you get a complimentary upgrade to the mvp experience.  it's only a few bucks to upgrade for future cuts (definitely always gonna go with the mvp treatment).  once you walk in, you're asked to check in with a tablet at the counter. was immediately greeted by jasmine after i completed my check in. she was very receptive to what i was looking to do with my haircut. she was also pretty experienced and well-versed with cutting asian men's hair. after the fresh cut, she took me to the back to wash my hair and laid a hot towel on my face, while the chair started massaging away.  that was all followed by a long, relaxing scalp massage by jasmine.  overall, got a good haircut and got the vip treatment from sport clips all thanks to jasmine. would definitely recommend jasmine for anyone looking for a sweet, friendly and skilled stylist."
every time i go in and see kay and her staff i am very pleased. good cut every time! thanks ladies for making my head look good lol:)
kay is the absolute best. i like most sport clips but this location is above and beyond. hardly ever a wait and parking is good.
"this place is goodish. for the price i would want a better haircut, but the stylists are really ice, riana was very sweet. i wanted it to look more even, but it always seems a little off.i would recommend forking over the money to see a real stylist."
i came in yesterday for a haircut and riana did an awesome job! she really knows what she's doing. it was cut at the right length on the top and on the sides. she's also the only one that asks to cut my eyebrows! nobody does that!  that's attention to detail!i was very satisfied and will go back again.
great location friendly staff clean clean clean.kids love it with sports on the tv and great communication.
"one and a half years ago, my boyfriend and i were heading to miami and realized our hairs were a mess. we didn't have time to go to a barber shop, so we just headed to this sports clips. ever since, we go here every two weeks to get our hairs cut because every single stylist here does an amazing job. not only that, but they all remember us and we've built relationships with them.we'll never stop coming here because of the right prices, deals, and amazing people. our favorite is erika, shhh!"
"sportclips is a great place for a guy to come relax, take in some sports, and get a great hair cut.     the mvp is the best value and includes a wash and little massage.    i've been a regular customer for years."
"kay g is the best!! just moved to sd and it took me 3 barber shops before i stumbled into sport clips and got my hair cut by kay. needless to say i have officially found my new home. always does a great job, very impressed!!"
"came here to get my sons hair cut- 3years old & 2 years old. the 2 ladies didn't greet them, didn't talk to them, and anyone with kids knows you have to be overly accommodating to get kids to trust you and listen. they did the job, cut their hair. weren't helpful or creative- very dry. and my 2 year olds ""fade"" is anything but a fade. as a business owner, its disappointing to see employees have such a disregard for hospitality and customer service- at the owners expense. i would not return here."
"first time to sport clips in clairemont mesa,kay and her staff were awesome!!! perfect haircut and a teatree shampoo after #spoiled is all i can say cause it was great!!! will defintely be coming back and going to tell my friends and co-workers."
worst haircut ive ever had! dont go here unless you want some terrible hair stylist to f*** up your hair
"went in for a hair cut and beard trim today. i had the please of getting my hair cut by the store manager kay g. super friendly, great conversation during my hair cut. she did a great job! recommend going through this location."
thank you kay! my girlfriend loves my haircut. :)
number 1 rule of getting a haircut is to always stick with the person that knows your hair better. mine has always been kay because she does a great job doing it right.
kailani is the very best. very detail oriented and pleasant. friday evenings there is no line. score!!
"after the second time saying, ""no, i said short,"" i finally gave up, went home and trimmed it myself. it's even and straight now too."
"first time was great, my boys were lucky to get tara.  today we walked in and literally were barked at by cait as we entered the door.  i was afraid to have her cut my son's hair after that!  she hardly cut anything off and copped an attitude when i called her out on it.  won't be returning."
"definitely call ahead!  we walked in and had 8 min to go after waiting 30 minutes.  we then were bumped to 30 minutes and now the wait says 50 minutes... not sure how they run their ""line"" but something was not working in our favor. still haven't had the hair cut so hopefully it was worth the wait.  there are a lot of other options out there."
"not the place to go if you have a son with long hair.  we usually go to the sports clips in carlsbad but we were in encinitas so stopped here.  the young lady who cut my son's hair was clearly not happy to be at work that day and was very grumpy.  she tried to wash my son's shoulder length hair and was not even able to get it all wet or pull it out from under his shoulders.  the haircut was a disaster, it was uneven in the front and when i mentioned that and asked that she check it she actually said ""i don't know how to do that""! i was shocked.  i gave up and we just paid for the cut and left.  the uneven bits were really annoying so we took him to the carlsbad sports clips yesterday to have it fixed. the lady there noted the front was very uneven but it was hard to fix it without cutting a lot more off.  she got it pretty good and fixed the rest of his hair.  she was surprised that we got such a bad cut at a sports clips.  i was not happy to have to pay twice for a basic hair cut."
"only my second visit today, but both times i've been impressed with rhia. friendly, makes me feel relaxed, gently upsells but doesn't press me. recent trips to other sportsclips have been unfavorable experiences - and so it's welcomed to feel at ease for even a 20 minute haircut."
they give good haircuts here. the hard stylists are nice. but they're online reservation is a disaster. i've reserved a spot numerous times and when i get there the wait time is significantly longer than indicated or i'm not registered at all. this is only a problem because the place is always busy. so if you go simply walk in you'll very likely end up having to sit and wait 30min or even over an hour. i saw many people walk in while i was waiting experiencing this.
"this sportclips actually yields some pretty strong cuts, assuming you get the right stylist. as with most chain hair cutting places, it's all about the stylist in order to obtain your desired style and the quality of cut. if you'd like a bit of a treat, i'd recommend you upgrade to mvp in order to get a bit of hot towel treatment, shampoo and a shoulder massage along with your cut. pros-mvpgreat location lots of stylists call ahead prior to arriving cons-subjective selection of stylists sometimes inconsistent gets crowded"
"great place for a haircut! friendly staff who will listen and give you exactly what you ask for, and the mvp treatment is the best! also the online check in is a great feature and really cuts down on any potential wait time."
"always call aheaad! the girls over here always do a great job with my hairs on my head. $20 for a cut and the clean ups are free to keep your cut fresh longer. i am a fan, but like i said always call ahead as it will likely save you time and often bumps you ahead of people. rookies!"
"we went last night around 6:30 and the girl in front desk she look at me and the moment she saw i was not american she look at her book wish was empty then her computer and said , im sorry you need to wait 25 min and the place was  empty and not even thank or sorry , nothing she just went and start talking to another girl in there and started moping , this is my first time that i have this experience and i always took my son there , make me and my son very sad and confused about why she treated us like we didn't matter. i just wish the owners really see why their business is going bad :(now we need to find another place to cut our hair"
"always a great cut!friendly staff, not usually much wait time,centrally located. the go-to place for my teenage son."
i needed to get a haircut and once again not enough time in the day. i had my hair cut at this shop about a year prior and wasn't happy with the result at all. i thought i would give em another shot to see if the gal who seemed to be timed by a stopwatch was a fluke. well once again i received the worst haircut since previous visit. for $ 20 you would think someone would give you a top notch detailed cut as well as razor cut your neck and side burns. with the volume of customers you would think these gals would have great skills. not. i'm never going there again i could probably hack my hair better myself!! also it's kind of hard to tell when they put goo in your hair and comb it until you wash your hair and try to do it yourself. horrible uneven scissor cut. my wife asked me what the hell happened to me
"i was working nearby and was in need of a haircut so i stopped in and i'm glad i did!!!for me haircuts are not all that exciting just something that needs to be done, so sports clips was kind of unusual for me because i felt pampere!!so let's get started my haircut was excellent! then it was followed up with my hair being washed and a warm towel for my face !!! it was nice i won't lie !!then it was back of the chair where she dried my hair a little and cleaned up my neck and eyebrows for me but if that wasn't enough i got a little massage with electric massager on my shoulders and neck !!! so now i'm relaxation mode!i am going to have to make a special effort to come back here on a regular basis in between the regular cut cut kick you out the door places !the staff there was very friendly and i look forward to seeing them again!thank you very much for the great cut and experience"
"very friendly and accommodating.  walk in and no wait.  and watch sports, great deal.  quick too."
my son loves this place. he loves the massage and the hot towel and always gets the mvp. this time he worked with cait and she was awesome!
great place to get your hair cut.  nice and professional stylists.  avoid going right before holidays at it gets very busy!
this sport clips is great. very nice women working here. i didn't have to wait long even though it was saturday morning. i needed a nice cut for my baby shower i had and they did a great job.
best hair cut for men in encinitas. where else can u watch sports and get your hair cut?
"this franchise as a whole is genius. it's basically a man cave with cheap haircuts. at first i was kind of embarrassed about getting their ""mvp"" treatment - which includes a shoulder rub at the end. hahaha. but hey, why not right?i like this spot and the concept so i bought their season pass too. let's you get haircuts at a discount by buying 5 in advance or something. it's actually a relaxing experience for guys, imagine that. anyway, i recommend it for boys and men. chicks might dig it too, but they're definitely not sport clips' target market. the hairdressers are very nice, professional and so far i haven't had any mishaps like that time at supercuts when i waked out with an inch of scalp over my ears. yikes that was horrible. they get my deal of approval."
"great haircut. after having long hair for a few years i was hesitant to have somebody new take clippers to my head. elisa cut my hair and knocked it out of the park! gotten a handful of compliments since i got it, will definitely be back."
we come to this location all the way from 4s ranch just to get my 13 year old twin boys' haircut! they love coming here to see polly!  she's really good and knows the popular styles for teenagers!  plus my boys do hip hop and they love the cool haircuts polly recommends and my boys are very picky!
i've submitted a review before for sports clips but not for cynthia! she is awesome! she did such a great job with my haircut and definitely gave the mvp service with my mvp cut. she's cut my hair a few times and has always done an awesome job! thank you cynthia!
"have been coming to get my hair cut here ever since my girl polly started working here!she's the best, very meticulous cutting my hair and i can tell she cares about the end result.very cool to talk to, great hair cut every time, can't say enough about the great experience i get every time here!"
i took my son to get his haircut. his bangs were right above his eyes and the last person i took him to (not sports clips) cut them crooked as well. i mentioned twice that the person who gave him his last haircut cut his bangs crooked too.  i specifically said not to cut that much off his bangs and just to even them up but a picture is worth 1000 words. it wasn't because my son was moving around because he was very cooperative. i would have given 1 star but the back was okay.
"my son loves coming here!they always take the time to ask him what he wants and make sure he is happy with the cut and give styling ideas and tips.great service, and i love that they have him in their system and he can handle this on his own."
"my son and i went in with full on mops on our head. with the summer in full blown 80's-90's at the beaches in san diego i felt it was time to trim it all. tracie took me right away. she was great!!! very pleasant, confident, made me feel very comfortable and trimmed my hair to my exact description."
awesome service! convenient online check ins. pretty stylists who are great what they do. always a welcoming environment as soon as you open the doors. i always come to polly at this location. she's awesome and i went to her at her previous location. great conversationalist! she does a great job with my hair!!!
"pholly is simply incredible. i drive out of my way to go and see her at sports clips. pholly is always friendly, professional and goes above beyond the needs of her customers. she leads with example and makes a great name for sports clips."
"first time there, alix was very helpful and great hairstyles. i'll be recommending people to go back to them - thanks"
polly is the absolute best.  i've been seeing since her mission valley sports clips days and followed her to this location.  great service and good value!
"the idea of listing the way i like my haircut on my file in the computer so i get the perfect haircut every time! the free neck trims anytime! the mvp & season pass! the products for sale which i only need to use a small portion and i get to try after my haircut! the kindness and customer service! i could go on & on. i've been a sports clips fan for years! almost forgot to mention, the new sign in addition with the computer tablet!"
"honestly i'm freaking pissed the hair cut wasn't what we asked for my 7 year old kept complaining about his ear so we check it and she had cut it and there was blood coming out, who the heck are you hiring have some kind of quality control and next time if you cut a kids ear tell the parents, i'm deeply disappointed."
always satisfied with the cut and mvp treatment. thanks! definitely get the whole mvp
almost always have a great haircut here. very nice people. mvp with wash and neck message are excellent.  had one bad haircut but the manager tried to fix it and comped the haircut. plus you can watch sports there. i've been coming here for years and get the mvp package. highly recommended
"i been here a few times when my regular girl is out of town & my haircut is very easy, just get the sides and back shaved..  there was no wait and all the workers were very nice but the girl who did my hair shaved the back of my neck with a razor to get the stuble a lil to hard and now my neck has razor burn & it took several days to heal. needless to say i wont be returning."
i had taken my two year old son to get his hair cut at a different business and he was so scared we left with a lopsided head of hair. i came in worried the same thing may happen. but as soon as veronika started cutting i could tell my son was comfortable with her and distracted. i was so happy with the experience. thank you!
"riana does not know how to cut hair. and quite frankly she had an attitude, from the very beginning when she chuckled at me because she did not know what a ""quiff"" was when i told her that is what i'm aiming for, to not even smiling or saying thank you when i gave her a $4 tip even though she missed a lot of long hairs on the top and in general just did a lazy job with my haircut. i will not be going back here again, which is a shame because the ladies here knew their stuff before they changed management. congrats riana, you win the award for the worst haircut i've ever got in my life. which is a pretty big achievement. work on your people skills girl."
"ive been going to sport clips for 4 years now, three different locations, and all of them provide great service, and a quality cut thats easy to fit in to your schedule. i am a fan favorite of polly, the new manager at this store. she is friendly, professional, and always does a great job. having someone who knows what you want each time you get your hair cut is a huge value to me. i highly recommend this place!"
"quinn is a very good barber!  i got a great haircut, shampoo, and neck rub. they offer a free neck trim in two weeks as well.  lots of tvs with ball games on in an atmosphere resembling a pro locker room."
great haircut at a good price!lori is the best...although try someone else so you don't give me a wait when i come in! ;)
"find a real barber. don't go here. first time going there today (7/18/18) wait was over 30 mins with only a handful of people inside. i asked for a medium fade. showed her were i wanted it with my hand on the side of my head. and....i got a high fade. i couldn't see what she was doing bc they put stickers on the mirrors so you can't really see yourself. she faded the hair into the top of my hair, a medium fade should be blended into the sides of the head. not the top. besides the fact she gave me a high fade, it was a terrible fade. waste or time and money. don't go. find a real barber. now i have to let my hair grow out for at least a month just to have it fixed with my next hair cut, which will never be at any of these chain haircut places again."
"jamie was my hairstylist she didnt waste a second of my time. very considerate and helpful, pretty too. i never rate anything 5 stars.."
"this place was great.  i got the mvp package which included the haircut, shampoo, steam towel, and head and neck massage.  all of this while watching sports on tv.  best of all, the price was great. all of that for 27 dlls.  i recommend hannah, who was very professional, polite, and highly skilled at her craft."
"come to sport clips pretty regularly...  sport theme, tv screens all throughout the store so you wont ever miss that sat college football game or sunday football.. maybe you are there on a monday! games games games!staff is pretty friendly,.... and their system has gone digital now you can check the wait times online for a specific stylist or just the wait in general, it is pretty easy set-up, it took me around 30 secs. give them your email, cell, verification and you are set.note: you will still to put in your info when you get to the store, just basically to say that you are there... you have around 30 mins. from when you go through the online process to get to the store before you are booted.prices vary depending on what you are getting anywhere from $5 to $30, i will also say get their stamp card! so you can get a half off on your 5th or 6th cut.parking can be hit and miss, sundays tend to be busy, but i have yet to wait longer that 30 mins to get a cut. thanks for going digital!!!"
got a nice hair cut there but it's definitely not a barber . they also don't do line ups really well.
my son an i went in today to get our haircut. good customer service but both of our haircuts are jacked up. my son's haircut is worse than mine i wanted to shave it bald when i got home. i wouldn't even take a homeless person here to get a free haircut that's how bad it is. never going back!!!
"sports clips is a fine substitute for supercuts. prices are very reasonable, haircut can be very good to bad. pluses:friendly staff. not too talkative which is what i prefer.decent stylists. i've had 3 very good stylists at this location and one really, really bad one. i haven't seen her since which is a good sign. avoid the 20 year old something looking girls. go for someone older and more experienced.good prices. $22 for a regular cut, $27 for the works. also, every time you try a new sport clips location you're upgraded to mvp haircut for free.they store your specific style in their system. regardless of who you have, notes of what the previous stylist executed is saved on a store to store basis. minus that one time i got the terrible girl who finished my cut in 5 minutes and my hair looked like skrillix.bad:monumental wait times. it is absolutely terrible. i've been an hour before closing, at 1pm on a tuesday, almost every time there is a ridiculous wait time. easily 30-45 minutes. if you go in when there's less than a 15 minute wait drive to vegas after, you'll have luck on your side."
this place closed early on a tuesday but i can still see staff inside horsing around at 5pm wtf!!? drove to another location in clairemount mesa and got better treatment instead of being told to leave
"got a good cut for 22 bucks. if you like sports, then you won't miss a game here. interesting place."
"when i don't feel like spending $50+ at a real barber, this is my spot. sometimes the wait can be long, but they do a decent job for a decent price."
been going here for about 3 years now. they recently upgraded their system so you can see how long the wait time will be. the staff has been super friendly every time i go.
lori was very helpful and listened to exactly what i wanted and did a great job. i will for sure be going back to see her.
awesome service! convenient online check ins. pretty stylists who are great at what they do. always a welcoming environment as soon as you open the doors. i always come to see melissia when i come to this location! (this is my main location) she's the best!!! highly recommend her!!! great conversationalist! she does a great job with my hair!!!
"amazing place to get a haircut! everyone is super nice and friendly, definitely coming back again. (:"
"i was sad when my barber of 20 years retired.  i tried a couple of places and then found trish at sport clips.  excellent cuts, nice person, good conversation or quiet when needed, and vip massages are outstanding.   she's a find.  usually a wait for her but she's worth it. this sports clip location is well kept & clean, a tv with sports while you wait, and an overall great environment.  customer service is excellent."
"i always receive great service and a great haircut from all the staff. the stylists are all friendly and professional. i especially like joanna because she is very down to earth,  we always have great conversations and i always get a great haircut from her."
"my husband had his hair butchered here back in december and they gave him several coupons to come back for free haircuts (at this location only). i happened to be with him on this particular visit and i did not appreciate the poor customer service we received. first of all yelp says they close at 5pm on sunday so we scheduled our plans around that. we got there at 4:45pm to find out they were open until 6 (annoying but at least they were still open). it was packed, only two seats open on the waiting area, so my husband went inside to put his name on the list and we were waiting outside until some seats opened up. my husband wanted to go to starbucks because it appeared to be a long wait, but he went inside to ask how long so we could make it back in time. he stood at the counter and lori came up to the counter and rudely said ""do you have a question?!""  he asked how long she thought the wait would be and she rudely replied ""25 min, is that ok with you?!"" he said sure and we went to starbucks while we waited. this place already left a bad taste in our mouths after butchering his hair, and they just put the final nail in that coffin today. this was his last free haircut that could only be used at this location, so we are much happier going to the one closer to our house were they are actually nice to us and appreciate our business. i don't care if you're having a bad day or whatever, you have no right to give someone an attitude when they are being nice to you."
"get the mvp but ask for joanna,her hands are like little miracles massaging your head. with the steam towel and the shampoo,you leave feeling fresh. i have always had good experiences here."
"clean store, friendly and skilled staff. hair cut always looks great. started getting a double mvp for 5 bucks more and it is just what i need to get me through my day. tue-thur seem to be better as far as not being as busy, but they do a great job of getting you in and out of there pretty fast.  thanks ladies!"
"tired of stylists rushing through your cut? not listening to anything you said? putting their own ""touch"" on your cut? go see amy h. and never worry about this again - she will take her time, ask you plenty of questions before cutting and make sure you're happy with the result."
our stylist was very attentive to please both my sons and mine concerns wants and needs. we came in on a sunday and there was no wait. the atmosphere was welcoming and clean.we both left very happy with his haircut and he always gets pampered with the mvp massage and steam towel.our stylist was jan. she took her time and did not rush.  the thing i hate more is paying for a rushed haircut.  i appreciate that she took her time and did an awesome haircut!  thanks
"quick service and watched some games during it, the lady who helped me was very nicegot starbucks while waiting"
"excellent haircut from amy, the new store manager. listened to what i wanted and did a great job making sure it was done right. highly recommend her as your stylist"
"my 2 teen sons live this place.  i love that you can schedule online.  love having trader joe's, restaurants and starbucks.  mom has to multitask!"
amy did an amazing job. she took her time and the attention to detail was just what i wanted. thank you!!
walked in to a store that was clean cool and all the staff where very friendly.. sat down with amy h to get a hair cut and received 5 star treatment and a excellent hair cut.. deffinatly going back again and i recommend this place to everyone...
just had a great experience here thanks to the manager amy. came in for a haircut first time ever & unfortunately either i wasn't making sense or the stylist who originally started cutting my hair was confused about what i wanted but amy noticed things were about to be a train wreck once we got started. thankfullllllly she stopped the hair cut & had me move over to her station where she turned what would've been a disasterous hair cut to one of the best of my life. thank you sports clips & thank you amy! i will definitely be back! satisfied & very happy !
"nice experience. the shoulder massage is a farce, thus 4 stars. everything else is good in the mvp service."
"if you want a fresh cut, go here!  my husband and two little boys visited this place for the first time and loved it!  the appt set up is super easy and we loved all of the tv's with sports games.  amy was our stylist and she was great.  we will become regulars!"
"i stopped in to get a haircut a few weeks ago on father's day weekedn and left very happy. juiliana, did a great job. she was very sweet. she even mentioned that she could trim my beard.  i agreed.  i walked out looking great and feeling awesome. thanks a lot, juiliana."
the manager i believe her name was jill was amazing!she cut both my sons hair and they were very happy with the service. teenage boys these days never know what they want but she listened to them and helped figure out exactly what style they wanted! she made them feel comfortable and i didn't feel like she was just trying to sell me stuff she explained what and why we needed things for our hair. couldn't be happier! loyal customer!
"jill the manager did a great job. she heard me and gave me the haircut i wanted, this is called great customer service.sorry gentlemen, no shaving of the beard. otherwise, great place for a guy to get a cut-style-hair wash."
conviniently located near my place. has sports playing while i wait and staff is nice. relaxing experience getting the triple play service.
well maintained and amazing service. the mvp is completely worth it. afternoon time is the best time to visit since there isn't much crowd!
"horrible customer service.  nobody greets you when you walk in.  you enter your name in a computer, and it goes on an electronic board that is supposed to tell you an approximate wait time.  all employees at this location were too lazy to update the board, so the wait time was blank next to everybody's name.  they also didn't serve people people in the order they arrived.  they just arbitrarily called names from the board.  after waiting 30 minutes with only one person in front of me when i arrived, i decided to leave.  so, i can't comment on the quality of cuts they provide.  however, if their attention to detail on something as simple as managing the lobby is that deplorable, i can imagine their hair cuts are average at best."
i've been going to this place for years now and have never been disappointed. jill is easily the best and most consistent barber. ask for her when you go.
"i recently decided to visit this sport clips location to get a haircut. i usually go to another shop to get my haircut, but my normal person was out of town and i had an upcoming business trip. this was my first time visiting a sport clips location. i did not have an appointment and signed up at the front as a walk-in. within a couple of minutes i was warmly greeted by julie. i explained that i was going on a business trip soon and that i normally go elsewhere to get my haircut. i'm always nervous letting a new person cutting my hair, but julie made me feel right at ease. she quickly assessed how i normally had my haircut and we discussed how she would be cutting it. she made some recommendations and adjusted the fade as well to make it look better.in the end i was pleasantly surprised by how much more i liked my haircut than the one i get at my normal place. i received a number of compliments on it and i plan to go see julie again next time i am in need!"
they spent a lot of time to make my haircut look great! was in and out in less than 45 minutes!
short wait. excellent haircut.  knowledgable and helpful stylists.  thumbs up to sport clips @ cherry orchard shopping center in s'vale.
"i went for my son's hair cut today. kate did an excellent job with hair cut, gave him a new look, was patient with all the subtle cuts my son wanted she took a lot of time and did a very good and thorough job with her. we will definitely come back. thanks kate."
"great spot, amy is awesome. takes her time and makes sure you're happy with the cut. also for the uninitiated, the credit card machine workflow is as follows:- insert card- remove card after error- press ""swipe""- swipe card- pin- done -"
"i had some business at fed ex office next door, and stopped here on a whim.  i simply wanted a neck trim and light cleanup on the edges.  i was fortunate to meet norma.  norma is exceptional.  we discussed what i wanted, my experiences with other barbers, etc.  once she understood, she did gave me what i wanted.  it was obvious she is a professional in her handling of the clippers.  she has a light touch and an eye for detail.  she's also a fine, interesting person, whose energy and personality i found very stimulating.  i just simply got the neck trim, nothing more, and felt i had met a good friend.  i was so impressed with her that i brought my son in the next day.my son is very particular about where he gets his haircut, and wasn't pleased with the cuts he's been getting here throughout the bay area.  norma took care of him, giving him an excellent cut, one that he was very pleased with.  she's very knowledgeable about the different styles, what might work best, and she took the time to understand what he wanted.  he said he'd get his cuts from her from now on.can't say enough about norma, but i give this place five stars."
"i went in scruffy and looking like i hadn't done a thing in quite some time and kate absolutely crushed the new look. easily best hair cut/beard trim experience ever! will be doing my hair cuts whenever i'm in town, i live in l.a., but best hair cute ever! before and after included"
"you know when it is a perfect match, when you get the best blend of courtesy, professionalism and talent. just got the best haircut i've ever had. i've  had some great hair stylists over the years but i never felt compelled to write a review until now. extremely courteous staff and talented hairstylists. the mvp experience is top notch( i almost dozed off during the neck massage and shampoo), very relaxing. i see now why this place has all 5 start reviews , truly deserves it. i'll say , if you truly care about your hair and a sucker for good service, you are in for a treat. keep it up guys"
"this was my first time at a sport clips, and i must say it was great! better service than any other salon i've been to. in fact it rebuffed me of the salon experience i had on a cruise ship!the staff is friendly and professional, and the owner is great!"
"disappointed yet again- this is the second time you guys messed up on my son's hair. specific directions were given to not touch his bangs or his sideburns, but yet again, sideburns shaved off and bangs cut short!  i'm not sure where the misunderstanding is?  seems like pretty straightforward and easy directions.  because i was not there in the salon with my son, i did not get to voice my disappointment in person or be a helicopter parent to monitor the hairstylist's every move. what's especially annoying is that my son now has to take school pictures looking like this. its too bad- i really wanted to like this place and my kids really liked the experience of coming here but having hairstylists that don't listen to simple directions is just not worth it- we won't be back."
love it. great cut. affordable price. they even massage your shoulder and head while putting a hot towel on your face while washing hair after cut. highly recommended.
i was in town for work and didn't have time before i left my home in nyc to get a haircut.  this location was close by and had great reviews.  i'm glad i dropped by.  the cut was even better then my regular barber and service was second to none.  i would highly recommend this location to everyone and will be sure to visit again on my next trip in the future.
"i came here for the first time last week for a haircut. nice environment, courteous staff and a great haircut. this is likely the place i'll go to for haircuts from now on. thank you!"
this is one of the best haircut places i have been to. we were visiting bay area from seattle and my two little boys needed urgent haircut. this was closest to our hotel so we stopped by and my kids had a lot of fun in addition to very smart haircut. they both got chance to chat about ca versus seattle weather and many other things with the employees there. such an amazing and friendly environment this store has. i would definitely go back there with my kids during my next visit. :)
"so just to start off, sport clips is amazing! i have gone to many places to get my hair cut like haircuts 2000, supercuts etc... and it is the same old thing every time poor service with poorly trained hair stylist just out of school... not to say that is true with every stylist that i came across there were a couple that were good and experienced but for the most part you got what you paid for. the first time i walked into sport clips i was really impressed with the decor and the way everything was laid out somebody definitely thought about how to have a hair salon for men with a amazing sports theme, flat screen tvs everywhere, sports memorabilia on the walls, cool seats while you wait and even a really cool tablet for when you check in to enter your information on! to top it off they have a refrigerator in the front while you wait and you can grab a water a sparkling water or even my favorite a kern's nectar fruit drink! i asked the owner to stock extra for me for when i come in and i was happy to see that a whole shelf was stocked the next time i came in! this is the kind of attention to detail that the owners have. being a business owner myself i am very impressed. i continue to frequent sports clips regularly for haircuts and weekly for their mvp if you don't know what that is go check it out is is worth every penny! you get a shampoo, hot towel on your face and massage it is amazing! i can't say enough good things about this place! go check it out!"
"this was my first experience at sport clips and i have to say i was extremely impressed! amy was amazing! she really took the time and listened to my issues i have had at other salons and also the issues i have with my hair. she offered some great products for me to use on my hair which they had in the salon and were 20% off! great deal! i also took advantage of the mvp treatment and it was amazing! i almost fall asleep, it was so relaxing! i don't live in san jose just visiting family but i will tell you that every time i come now to visit i will be stopping by to see amy!"
"i really wish you could give 0 stars. this was our 2nd try at this place, only because of how nice the stylist was the first time around. haircut was just ok, but i wanted to give it another try before abandoning the place. wow, what a mistake that was, my poor son came home looking like he needed a haircut more than ever. it was just awful. the woman couldn't comprehend what my husband was trying to tell her and gave up hoping she knew what she was doing. unfortunately, we are left trying to figure out how someone can be employed cutting hair, yet clearly cannot cut hair. do yourself a favor and save your hair, go somewhere else."
this is a great place for a mens haircut. the owner and staff are very kind. i took my african american son here and he was very happy with his haircut. i appreciated not having to smell hairspray or nail toxins while i waited. we will go back.
"the staff opened at ten am on the dot and the two hair stylists were incredibly nice and attentive with me and with my 18 month old son. they were nice, on time, caring, and extremely attentive. i will definitely be back for a haircut for me and my son. i always get a number five on top and a number three on the sides. my son got a cut with scissors and came out looking totally dapper! this was a great experience for baby's second haircut and daddy's umpteenth haircut."
"i'm really curious as to why this place as 5 stars?!? maybe we just had a bad experience! fiancé went to get his hair cut and he looked exactly the same when he came out as he went in? the person didn't understand was numbers he wanted and barely cut anything, he even requested more off but they didn't know how and called the manager over to make sure it was right. only cool thing was the hot towel since he was a first time guest but not our favorite place."
"was such a great experience.  i just had my hair mutilated at another hair salon that literally should have just been shaved off. i walked into sport clips never expected the treatment i received.  i had my hair cut repaired, got a rinse in a messaging chair with a steam towel and and neck message. i had a relaxing great experience with this place when i thought i couldn't have a worse day. to top it all off at a great price too. disappointed i'm from out of town, i would definitely make this my regular spot if i was local."
"to make a long story short: replace the barbers who are terrible please. i normally don't write reviews on yelp but this haircut was so disgusting i just couldn't not write one. i'm going around san jose trying out different barbers so it was my first time here. the barber i had seemed to have little experience cutting mens hair. my taper fade was so off it wasn't even close to a fade?? (they just cut the sides right off) she also cut like double the length of my hair that i asked and the front of my hair was so uneven. you get a special treatment if it's your first time here which i guess is nice of them. but seriously, replace some of the barbers in your shop cause they are really bad. ruined my day :("
"i'm not sure why anyone would give this place five stars. both stylists were rude, and didn't seem to know how to handle the front desk, let alone givemy sons decent haircuts.the younger one, who was obnoxious, was surprisingly the better stylist. my son's cut, though, was okay, not great.the older one gave my other son a buzz cut, which i didn't want. she kept asking me what number i wanted the razor on, and i told her i would prefer she use scissors instead. the result was an ugly, awkward style that even gel won't fix.we won't be returning."
"love the mvp package, great service, clean place, water cooler, several tv's tuned to sports, and ghinet is the best! check-in online during peak hours, other times little to no wait.ghinet is very detailed, thorough, and consistent. after several other hairstylists elsewhere, she's about the only one that cuts my hair the way i like it and repeats it ""just like last time"" lol. apparently this is hard for some. she is also very nice, respectful, and social, but won't talk your ear off if you're not engaging her. as always, thanks ghinet and see ya soon!"
"fine haircuts but the magazine selection is totally off here. martha stewart living, better homes and garden, and stars--not a single car magazine. i guess they're for mothers who take their kids here but throw me a fricking dog bone!"
just moved into the area and got my first hair cut done from evette who was very nice and took time to cut my hair. got the mvp package which was great. i was very pleased with the overall experience and would recommend it to anyone looking to have a haircut done.
"i so happy to do hair cut in sports clips , because today i did hair cut i really like to be here and also he gave me compliment for steam and relax because they're running promotion anyway thank you"
"i have been constantly going to this specific sports clips and choosing evette to always cut my hair! she's always warm and welcoming and she makes sure she takes her time when she cuts my hair. a few months ago she recommended that i should purchase the nioxin shampoo for fine hair! ever since then my hair has been stronger, more healthy and has been regrowing at a great rate. if any of you guys end up coming here make sure you pick evette as your stylist!"
the wait at this place is honestly unbearable . i only took my two little boys here because of the sports theme but the prices are a little on the high side for kids haircuts and one of the ladies that cut my sons hair(jeanette) gave my son a really crappy haircut-uneven. don't waste your time and money here. plenty of other places.
theresa is amazing! she's extremely thorough and pays attention to detail. i am so relieved to have finally found a great barber that i can trust. thank you theresa!
"this is a review of yanet with sports clips. i used to get my hair cut from a stylist friend, but he moved a few years ago and i began coming to yanet. she does a terrific job and i highly recommend her to you.note: to the reviewers that think they were past up while waiting. sorry, but we put our names on the list before you and then leave the shop. we return later for our haircut appointments. to eliminate any confusion, sports clips has installed a new computerized system with a tv screen on the wall with the waiting list of the customers name and their approximate wait time."
this is the absolute worst place to get a hair cut. the ladies working there have no clue what in the world they are doing. the asian lady that jacked my hair up barely spoke english and shaved off half of the hair on one side of my head. i even showed her a picture and she still had zero clue what to do. never going here again
horrible horrible horrible. worst haircut ever. she just cut away without giving any time to actually give a decent haircut. all of them can't cut. no wonder they've been trying to hire new stylists for at least two months now.
"waiting is too long, haircut was average, and they really push you to buy hair products or upgrade to their higher priced services. customer service is below average. person cutting my hair was rude"
"this is my first time to this sport clips location, i have been to some in the past and they always do a great job. every time i get my hair cut i get the mvp and i never regret it because how can you not like a hair cut with a shampoo, hot towel on your face and a massage, plus you can not beat the tvs they have on with football."
i took my 11 year old son here for haircut. the lady really rushed through his haircut because she had someone waiting for her. my son was a little bit fidgety and i could see her getting frustrated and raising her voice at him. the haircut she gave him was decent. however i paid full price and even tipped her and my son didn't receive all the services that i paid for. i now find out that part of the service that is included in the haircut includes a shampoo and a hot towel which my son did not receive. i understand that she had someone waiting but we also our customers and we are paying as well. i will not be recommending other people to be coming here and most likely will not come here myself. each customer should be treated respectfully and receive the services they pay for
"first of all please update your cover photo. i don't think any of those girls work there anymore. number two please get rid of the online booking ahead. not fair to somebody waiting in the parking lot for you to open where i was first in the parking lot and then someone else pulls in after me like us to sit down first. other than that yanet, is awesome and i will continue to be going there as long as she is there."
"very friendly staff! my son loves the mvp hair cut, includes steamed towel, massage shampoo, neck & shoulder massage for $23 ($27 for adult). lucky kid! slow in here right now! no wait!"
"sport clips is my new go to place for a nice clean hair cut. i highly recommend the mvp package. it is well worth the money. i had the pleasure of having yanet cut my hair the first time. she cut my hair so well that when i went back for the second time. i requested her to cut my hair. she does a job and know how to cut hair well. she is very good at blending in my fade from a ""0"" to ""1"" nicely, she makes me feel comfortable every time. she is very detail oriented and i like that she remembered me from the first time. thank you yanet, i will definitely be coming back for my next cut. mvp deal is the best by far."
i took my 10 year old son for a haircut. he wanted to try a new haircut and get a cristiano ronaldo type of style. yanet was great! this is the best haircut my son has had! i highly recommend yenet! the atmosphere is good and we enjoyed watching the game while we waited
worst place to come for haircut . if you like a quick rushed haircut where they just want to get to the next customer this place is for you . the lady tried to tell me what i want which is never good because you only saw me one time i know what i want and what i usually get i dont need them to do what they feel like doing . she literally spent 5 minutes on my hair and only used the buzzer i wanted a scissor cut  . i would never come back to this place who disguises their bad hair stylist for dumb gimmics like massages ... people come to get a haircut if the stylist were as good as their gimmics this would be a go to spot . spend some extra money and go to a real stylist .
"i ve been coming to sport clips in blossom hill for over a year, and i have to say that i really like this place.  i especially like yanet.  she is very professional and courteous and does an exceptional job.  she understands and helps achieve the style you want.  my teenage sons are really picky, and they will (now) only wait for yanet to cut their hair. i'm amazed at how she can multi task, as a manager and a stylist, and deliver a great customer experience. i highly recommend yanet!  ps you can't go wrong with the mvp package either!"
besides the wait a fairly good place. probably only the second place i've gone to( out of 7) that actually can cut my hair to the specifications i state while making it nice. the star taken off was only due to price(22$ for haircut... so w/ tips probably 26-27) as well as the wait.
