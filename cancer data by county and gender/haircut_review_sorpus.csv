"i walked in with a lot of ""hair baggage"" - heavy processing, regrowth, etc. i needed to get damaged hair cut off while retaining as much length as possible. stacey nailed it. she was easy to talk to and understood what i needed pretty quickly."
"if zero stars were an option. checked in on line, when we arrived i explained that my daughter needed a shampoo/blow dry. the girl that came up to the counter began to act strangely and rudely said she could do a shampoo and 'i can do a finger dry"".apparently they didn't have time to dry hair with a brush because they are having a hair cut sale and ""customers for haircuts might come in""i have never heard of a business that didn't want to take your money for services.my daughter spent almost 2 months in a burn hospital and is unable to wash and blow dry her own hair. this was the most ridiculous display of customer service, i have ever experienced. wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.maybe they should display a huge sign on their door and on line...stating....""we are only able to do $7.99 haircuts right now even if no one else is in here...because they might come in at any moment!"
"this review should be negative stars! do not get your hair cut by the older hispanic lady with the glasses, she will butcher your hair!!! she messed up my kid so bad he had to buy a hat just to cover what she did to him  it was such an easy cut..smdh! this lady cut half of his head bald, honestly she should not be cutting hair! she should be fired!"
"crummy service.  seems like every time i come here they shorten the time they spend with you.  hurried cut, leaving hair all over your clothes, face, forehead.  don't even think about going back to work or anywhere after this cut except straight to a shower.  pathetic.and now let's talk about the actual haircut.  crappy to say the least.  shoddy job, crummy uneven cut by all stylists, not even a fraction of what a true barbershop could accomplish.  simply put don't go here unless you want pure garbage."
bad experience. i went there because i had a coupon but apparently they don't take electronic coupons. we live in an electronic world. would never go back
some new girl just gave me a crew cut. said my customer info said that was my cut. week before big business. trip.  i am not a vain person but this is ridiculous. never going here again.  told girl i get it cut every month of 6 weeks.  can't she tell i don't get a crew cut.  ignorant and inexperienced.
"crappy place, does not take expired coupons. doesn't state on window about there coupon policy. will not go there again"
"if i had known that i was going to get my hair chop-chopped  by edward scissorhands then i wouldn't have even entrusted my precious hair to them.  i realize, of course, that by going to great clips i wasn't going to be getting a grade-a  haircut but then again i wasn't going to great clips for anything but a trim.  a very minimal trim that should have been anything but difficult...instead i got a hair trim where way too much length was taken off and the cut itself looked too, top choppy.  my hair now looks as if i had taken a pair of kitchen scissors to my hair and just started cutting away.  when i went in i specifically asked for a teeny tiny trim so that my dead ends could be done away with and i also specified that i did not want any thinning or layering of my hair.  what did i get?  an inch and a half cut off of my hair and the most choppy layers imaginable.  the cost of the haircut was $14 and for females (who, sorry guys, need much more effort and acute attention put into our hair) you get what you pay for.  if i'd known they'd be so incompetent at simply trimming the ends i'd never have step foot in here. i'd never have come for an actual haircut and i guarantee that i never will.  however, for males, great clips is a good option and in fact my fiancé comes here and gets his hair cut regularly and it always turns out well."
"been coming here for years and love this place. so much so that even after i moved to the city i still find myself coming back to them. go see ross, wait for him if he's busy with another customer. he is absolutely worth the wait. i promise you that you will not be disappointed."
"stopped in today for a haircut. i have been to great clips before so they have a write up on how i like my hair cut. things seemed to be going smoothly when the lady cut off a large chunk of my hair. it was late and dark, so i paid for my haircut, tipped her and left. i get home to better light...the lines around my ears look like an impressionist painting. it is basically a buzz cut because she left so little of my hair long on the top of my head. i will never return to this location. waist of time and money. guess i have to wait for my hair to grow back."
went for a quick haircut during lunch and got a great one from ross.  he was attentive to exactly the haircut i wanted.  made sure the top was the length i wanted before he actually cut.  i would definitely come back here for another cut from him.  in and out in less than 30 minutes too!
"horrible service. checked in online, arrived on time, and was asked at the counter if i checked in online to which i confirmed. then sat there and was repeatedly skipped for 20 minutes beyond my time until had to ask why i was being skipped for people walking in without appointments and i was blamed for not checking in at the desk when the lady obviously failed to mark it after asking me initially. what is the point of an online app if you ignore those that use it? and where is the customer service to ask why 1 guy has been sitting there for 30 minutes while the person walking in now gets helped."
"great place for an inexpensive but decent hair cut. bill (owner) is very friendly, and makes sure his service standards are kept high whether he is there or not. a great plus when the place is open long hours for your convenience. most stylists do decent with my frizzy, thinning hair. as with most things, some do better than others.a great option is to sign up online to save your place and cut wait times! you can't pick a stylist, but can save 15 minutes by getting in line before you leave the house!also check for coupons. great deals in the mail! tip well if you like the service, too."
"went in to have about 2 inches cut off the bottom of my straight long hair. i asked her for a perfectly straight even bottom line cut. also stated that i absolutely did not want the front to be any shorter then the back & that i did not want a curved look. started with a shampoo which was optional by the way, and a conditioning treatment to detangle. the shampoo job was ok but i didn't think she rinsed much of the conditioner out. the stylist didn't organize the hair very well as she was cutting it, and literally she finished in slightly over 5 minutes. when she was finished she showed me the results whilemy hair was still wet. well , you can't tell anything when the hair is still wet. i guess at that point i was done and expected to leave. so i asked if she was able to blow dry it and style it which is pretty easy with straight hair that's all one length. she used the blow dryer and tossed my hair around with her fingers a little bit and then asked if that was ok. now it was worse and even harder to tell if she cut it straight. my head was still very wet so i asked her to finish drying it. i think she was bothered by this because now a couple people had come in the front door and were waiting. she never used a brush to assist in the drying process. when she said she was done the 2nd time, i still had wet sections throughout my hair and it wasn't even brushed or combed to lay flat so there was no way to tell if this was a good haircut. once i got home i rewashed my hair because it felt like there was still a sticky layer of conditioner left in it from the stylist, and i wanted to check and see if my hair was cut straight. after i dried and styled and smoothed my hair as i usually do i saw that the haircut was a disappointment and a fail ... it is not a continuous straight line, the front is shorter then the back and there are areas that are jagged throughout. so, skip this location if you're looking for a nice simple straight line . mine turned out crooked and the overall experience was not great . the conversation she initiated was a downer too. all she talked about was cancer... i should probably go back and ask someone else if they'd be willing to correct my cut, but i'm reluctant thinking the place is really centered on the ""quick get em in and get em out"" business mode, not quality. i'm not sure why i even gave it a 2 star rating . it did however appear to be clean."
friendly and clean in and out 30 min no appointment just walked in. they did a great job. i've used them every time i'm at the all state arena doing a show. i've used great clips all over the u.s. never been dissatisfied or disappointed!!
"so i just witnessed one of the most rude customers in my life at this great clips. i was patiently waiting for my haircut when this lady starts yelling at the one of the employees about how she's getting screwed in her prepaid haircuts. i don't know the background and whole story why she was so upset. it doesn't matter. there's absolutely no reason to yell across the store when the person you're speaking with is two feet away, especially when your children are with you. what a wonderful example to set for you kids. throughout it all, the employee was professional, helpful and kept her calm. at one point she did end up tearing up, excused herself and walked to the back room to compose herself. the customer then complained and yelled about how she just left her and didn't resolve her problem. ridiculous and embarrassing. she should be ashamed of herself, but she won't. she never will. she's ignorant to the world and will always think she's right no matter what and will teach those lessons to her kids. let's continue the cycle. as for the employee? thank you so much. you are an amazing person to be able to put up with people like that. i couldn't have done it."
"i respectfully disagree with a previous comment, this place was over priced and not a good haircut.   i actually went to another barber shop after leaving this place.   this was easier than to keep on trying to explain what was wrong."
"been here twice. i had different styists each time but i don't mind not having the same stylist every time i get a hair cut.  service is always super friendly and courteous. the owner/manager (guy who greets customers) is always friendly & accomodating. super clean place. hair on the floor are swept/cleaned right away. called ahead to set up appointment but owner said no appointment necessary for a hair cut. service is straight-forward, quick, no muss/no fuss, and affordable (i believe approx. $15 per hair cut).  keep up the great work!"
"ross cut off my long hair into a short style on my lunch! when i got back to the office everyone complimented me on the beautiful cut. 5 stars for ross talented, professional, personable ."
"if i could put no stars in i would. i went in here today with my mom. both of us have been in before and had good and bad experiences. after today though, my entire family will never return. i was there a month ago and the man who cut my hair did not really do what i asked. when i got home, i wasn't too happy but i decided to wait and see if it would grow on me. it didn't. and everyone i talked to about it said my hair looked uneven and everything i did didn't help. i went in today and started to explain how unhappy i was and the stylist began arguing with me about it. she told me i was wrong and that it wasn't uneven. i told her i had even consulted with another stylist before going in today and that the stylist said it was uneven and needed to be fixed. she continued to say i was wrong and i decided to get up and leave without a haircut. i'm not a big believer in ""the customer is always right"" but i do know that i am the one who has to style my hair everyday for work and no matter what i do it looked horrible. my teenage students could even tell that it was a bad cut. my mom received a haircut that was way shorter than she asked for and it was uneven as well. we will not ever return to this salon. we are currently at another place altogether and getting our hair fixed; we will go here from now on."
they cut extensions!! hair cuts for purchased hair (lol) is getting increasingly difficult to find. stephanie cut my hair and did an amazing job. very happy.
my hair is pretty simple to do. and mike took all of 5 minutes to do it. the top seems ok but the back is asymmetrical and with a weird invected half circle instead of a straight line. maybe at 9am they are still a little groggy.. dunno. i expected a little more attention to detail. disappointing.
"mike is my absolute favorite stylist in chicago. i've gone to other places to get my hair cut and even sat in other stylists' chairs at this great clips location, but nobody listens and cuts like mike.i'm growing out my hair right now so i'm a relatively ""easy"" trim, but it makes such a difference when i can walk out the door still feeling like my hair is long. mike is also great at evening up my bangs and layers each time so i don't look too scraggly.i've loved coming here for the past three years and will continue to stop in no matter what neighborhood i move to!"
i came here right when they opened at 9 am to get about 4 inches cut off my obnoxiously long hair. they offer a special where you can get your haircut for 10 bucks between 9 am and noon on weekdays. stephanie was my stylist and she was amazing! very kind and gentle with my hair. the salon was clean and the service was amazing.
"i always come here to get my hair cut or trimmed because of it's convenience and also because it offers a great student discount. i've never been one to pay $20+ for a trim so great clips is the perfect option. i never check-in online (their version of an appointment) but there never is much of a wait which is nice. the hair cut itself, since it is a trim usually lasts pretty short so it's quick and easy! however, last time i was here the hair stylist was so rough with my head by the end i was sure he had pulled out more hairs than cut. i understand my hair may have been tangled but he was really going at it with the comb to get the knots out and i feel like it could have been done a lot gentler. in general he was rough during the cut as well and while the final look ended up fine it wasn't the most enjoyable hair cut i've had.the venue is nice and clean but this experience really caught me off guard and i will have to check who is working next time before i walk in so as not to experience the same thing."
"walked in this morning and was seated immediately! just wanted to leave a review thanking stephanie, you did a great job with my fade and it was really nice chatting with you about school and chicago!hope to be back soon if i'm in the area. good luck with your upcoming internship too! thank you stephanie!"
"mike, the manager here, is the only person that i go to for a haircut.  there are 20 other places to get a haircut that's closer to me, but mike is the absolute best so i go here.  the overall vibe here is very lively and very friendly"
"we recently moved to california but i needed to leave a review for the wonderful, fabulous mike at great clips. he cut my family's hair for the 3+ years we lived off clark street in lincoln park. he is a wonderful person and a very talented stylist! we miss you mike!"
"they dont know how to cut hair, i literally asked for a trim. how hard can that be? its uneven its a wreck. they are not professionals."
"i have been to this salon before and generally get a decent cut, but tonight i am unhappy because i explained that i was growing out my hair on top and i just wanted the sides and back cut with as little as possible cut from the top. it looked fine when i left the salon because my hair was still wet. when i arrived home and it was dry, it was much shorter than i wanted. i am very disappointed since i have been growing out my hair for months. i think i will start looking for a new place to get my hair cut where they actually listen to you."
"stephanie is easily the best hair stylist i ever had the pleasure to go to.she likes her work, does it to perfection and has an awesome sense of humor too.i, personally, have a kinda weird style statement and i mostly don't listen to stylists, etc. but stephanie definitely understands what i look for and gives me perfect suggestions, which i listen."
"this great clips is alright. the staff is friendly but the few times that i've visited, they made mistakes. the first girl that cut my hair was excellent, so i came back. the next one gave me a slightly uneven hair cut but it wasn't anything i couldn't touch up myself. the most recent experience was embarrassing because the stylist said my previous haircut didn't look great, which i agreed with but after she gave me a trim and tried to fix the uneven sections, she said she still didn't like it but there was nothing else she could do. i let her know that i didn't mind losing length as long as the mistakes were corrected. my hair at the time was mostly all one length so i thought it would be a fairly simple correction.i decided to pay more at another salon to receive more consistent cuts. i hope to return in the future because it's so close to home and reasonable in price but unfortunately it's not an option at this point in time."
"this shop just relocated but i went to their previous location on diversey several times and i've always come out with a good haircut at a great price. this may not be the place if you have some complicated haircut that you're anal about but for a basic haircut they get the job done.  they usually have three or more people working so there usually isn't much of a wait.  if you can get in weekdays between 9:00 a.m. and noon, a haircut is only $9.99. otherwise, it's $14."
alex is a real star:) she is amazing! i went and had an up-due for a very important event with her and for a fraction of the salon price she absolutely knocked my socks off with her creation. please ask for alex and you will have blow out of a lifetime... love love love my experience!
"i love this salon! i have a boyish pixie cut that i am very particular about, and a fear of haircuts has had me cutting it myself for years. this is the only place i've been to with stylists who seem to really listen to what i want and give such satisfactory results! i've been seeing stephanie here for months (by coincidence! she always ends up the one cutting my hair) and she's incredibly sweet and funny, and so easy to talk to! she always does a great job -- i know i'm going to have a great day every time i see her! she's really respectful of me trimming my bangs and sides in between haircuts, too, which i appreciate! she cuts off the extra bulk, but leaves my style exactly the way it is. i am so grateful for this great clips!"
"definitely a great deal. i was paying double + tip for a great haircut nearby so decided to try and cutback on expenses and check out great clips. the shop is clean, the price is great (i had a coupon but weekdays 9-12 are $9.99 and usual price is $14) and my barber joey helped alleviate some of the usual awkwardness of a haircut by adding some decent conversation!"
"great haircut, great service, and what a clean shop.  mike gave me one of the best haircuts i've had in a long time!"
"great new place- they just moved from their old location on clark/diversey.  this new place is very clean, nice, and the service was great.  i was in and out in under 15 minutes with a great haircut."
"checked in online way before noon, braved the - 25 windchills to get there, ended up arriving due to traffic and weather at 12:02, and they wouldn't honor the early bird special that ended at 12. the former store on diversey would have honored it as long as i was checked in, and in fact did so in the past. not the way to treat a regular customer, so they lost this one."
"i went in for a simple 1inch trim of my hair and ended up loosing about 4inches. i had long hair with a slight angle, i don't think the girl knew what that meant because before i knew it i was missing half of my hair in the front. it was a waste of money and now i'll have to wait months for my hair to grow back out."
never too busy when i come in. they always have great staff and a cheery demeanor. the cuts i get are always what i want and they have no problem fixing up anything i want touched up. consistently great men's cuts!edit: after waiting 20 minutes a couple who had called in were bumped in front of me. i was not told they might have someone in front of me and they didn't let me know what was going on when they took them instead of me until i asked.
"i wish i can give this salon a zero stars but i can't. walked into the great clips on elston in chicago; i asked for a haircut. first of all they stylist both were so rude. one literally screamed across the salon to get the attention of the other person who would eventually cut my hair. so few things about this stylist who serviced me, 1. she had dirty clothes on and just messy ( the insoles on her shoes were out and flapping as she walked )2. she took literally 5 mins to cut my hair. i asked her for a bob i even showed her pictures. she split my hair in 3 and cut all the same length. i've gotten plenty of bob haircuts and no one has taken that approach would not be back to any great clips. even that 15 $ i paid was too much."
"the owner of this location is garbage, and so is the staff. hence why it shut down quickly after new ownership. it's sad how they tarnish the name of a big company simply because the owner of this specific location puts zero quality into it's establishment. zero customer service whatsoever and terrible haircuts all around."
i receive by far the worst hair cut i've every had and will never go back to a great clips ever again. this women should not be allow to cut anyone else's hair. beware!!!
wow these people are terrible. they closed to early when online it says 6pm. and when you call them they literally hang up on you. i understand it's sunday you want to go home and rest but do your job right. especially if it says open until 6pm it's 4:28. stop hanging up on your customers.
5:34 on sunday store closes at 6:00 but the guy won't cut my sons hair . doors are locked and he is cleaning . thanks great clips i
"this place is busy,but i understand why.. lydia is very nice. she was able to cut my daughter's hair with no issues. very friendly staff. if you want to get in on time, use their app. you can schedule your cut. nice touch..."
"sometimes this place gets really busy and the wait can be 45 minutes.  but the workers are friendly, and the interior is clean.  they do give out these coupons for savings off of cuts and since it is next to me i been going here.  shares the lot where i work so it has huge parking, and if you do have to wait, there is a subway and a starbucks walking distance."
being a huge fan of great clips i went by and picked up a haircut. this seems to be a new location. the lady who cut my hair did a great job and i have no complaints. the store was clean and service was fine. i'll probably go back here again since it's kind of close to where i live. nothing else really to report. just another great clips.../shrug
lydia the manager was very friendly & helpful after i had a bad incident there. since then i only go there to get my haircut now & i always make sure she is the one to do it. i am quite satisfied.
"went here for a haircut two weeks ago, it was my second time. i say, wasn't too crowded. was called and said that i wanted a shampoo and wash. so, i have very thick and wavy hair. i had rose who was nice.  went out to dinner with my friend tonight and she informed me that my hair is completely lopsided and uneven.  i was mortified.  she took a pic for me to see and since i wasn't offered a blow dry with the haircut i guess that's why it wasn't noticed. i wish i never wasted my time or money here, and i wish i went to gallery of hair instead.  more money,  but at least i would have been happy the first time.  now i have to go get it redone and even shorter than what i wanted.  on my job interview tomorrow i have to wear my hair down, but not with this embarrassing haircut, that looks like i did it myself."
"friendly staff, clean atmosphere, quick service and extra coupons to save you a few bucks!!! i get my hair cut here regularly and i use the handy app to check in... in and out in approximately 20 minutes with a great haircut!"
"i never actually got my haircut here...i was in the shopping center and thought i would get a haircut. when i walked in a women from behind the counter barked out ""phone number?""  i was the only person there so i knew she was talking to me. why does an off-price/chain hair cut place that doesn't take appointments need my phone number? what happened to the canned chain store greeting? ""welcome to our mega company""i quickly realized why i was the only person there and left."
"i love this place. you can get a great, top notch haircut for under $20 including tip! eyebrows trimmed/cleaned up for free....as a guy i am not good with my eyebrows! parking is also very easy as it's located in a strip mall type setting with lots of available spaces ... the stylists (espcially lydia) are very knowledgeable and friendly.... all of the information about your haircut is saved in the computer for next time...for example the number buzzer you need, length on top etc...i also was told you can check into the waiting list online to save time.....(though i've never waited that long ). and they also have an early bird special and free haircut after ten cuts...... really happy with this place and location!!"
"well .. walked in about an hour after they opened. one stylist working .. one client in the chair .. on in the waiting area. she checked me in, and told me to ""run an errand for 20 minutes."" .. no worries , i was a walk-in, and it was only 20 min. ran my errand , came back .. apparently, when i was told to ""run and errand"" .. 4 clients before me were also told to ""run an errand"".. waiting area was full, still one stylist, and i was 4th in order .. translation , and hour and a half / 2 hour wait for a basic cut. if the stylists would have been more honest upfront , or a bit more welcoming , perhaps i would have stayed or tried it again.. i know it's a cheap, assembly line haircut. you get what you pay for ..thankfully due to the one stylist and several clients , i didn't even get the chance to pay for anything."
"very good customer service, usually in and out pretty quick. i've seen them be very understanding in tough situations and i've never had an issue."
"very friendly service, open minded staff who is open to anything i want adjusted in a haircut. always clean when i come. or stylists are cleaning. love the clip notes, they know what to do before i sit down unless i want to change it!"
horrible! rose cut my hair. she was rude and chopped up my hair like one of the previous reviews on here. it was not busy when i went. she was complaining about previous clients while she cut my hair to the other hairstylist that was there. she complained because of my online check in. she did not let me check my hair. stating it was all even. never again. i should have checked yelp before coming here. do not let rose cut your hair!
"force of habit:  i've been using great clips at home in california for years, so i naturally gravitated to the one in my temporary chicago neighborhood .  no surprises.  not busy at 10:00 on a monday morning; two clippeuses on duty, tending to two clippees, out of a total of five barber chairs.  i sat for just a few minutes in the seven-seat waiting area rather grandly referred to as the lobby.  i'm a pretty un-fussy customer; ""lob six weeks offa this"" is about as persnickety as i get.  and the lobbing proceeded quickly and efficiently.  i noticed that my clipper made more use of scissors than most great clips personnel.  i walked out fifteen minutes later and only fourteen dollars lighter (senior rate).  not bad."
"third bad cut here. are we sure they're licensed? do i need to explain what a pixie cut means? first time the dude left it misshapen. second time, lady left one side longer than the other. that grew out ugly. just left the place, i've got the worst haircut i've ever had in my life. i sat down and she reads the notes from last time which should say a 2 and 3 on the sides then finger length on top. she goes so ""so it's a 2 and a 3? i said yes because i thought she was just clarifying razor lengths. she used a 3 on the whole thing and it took 3 minutes. i know it's a cheap haircut place, but when someone comes in with an overgrown pixie wouldn't you ask twice before giving them a buzzcut? don't just look at your ""last time"" notes. talk it thru with the customer. that's my dignity you're messing with. god, i don't know shit about grooming but do i really have to hold miss beauty school's hands thru a haircut? at least i wear a hat at work and don't have to get another for like 6 months.and the thing that's been an issue the last 3 times, they're not paying attention to you because they're chatting with their co-workers the entire time. they just want you in and out. sometimes it baffles me how much people in customer service don't care."
"debbie = avoid. do not get your hair cut by debbie. i love great clips and have been going for years (and still plan on going) but this is by far the worst haircut i've had as an adult. debbie sat me down, and asked me what i wanted. i told her ""i normally have a combover on top but i just want it shortened and thinned out a little, and that i normally do a 3 on the sides faded nicely into a 2 near the neck"". interestingly, she wasn't paying attention to me while i was talking, but i just assumed that she was experienced and she was listening. apparently not. of what i said, the only things she seemingly heard were ""top want shortened"" and ""sides faded"". so the end result is i have essentially a buzz cut on top like someone had gone over it with a 5 or 6 razor (combover completely lost), and the sides are completely buzzed as she went over it with a 0.5 or no guard at all. when i put my glasses on at the end, i was shocked at how short everything was, and i told her this is not what i wanted. debbie responded ""you asked for a fade, this is what a fade is"". i told her that i said i wanted a 3 faded into a 2 on the sides and neck, not a straight up fade. debbie said ""well nothing we can do now"". on top of that, there was essentially a ""military look"" where there was hair on the top and no hair on the sides without a clean fade/transition between the two. when i told debbie that this was way shorter than i had wanted and it's too choppy and not transitioned well, she said ""well you don't have to pay for it if you don't want to"". i said that wasn't my concern, i just wanted it improved or fixed as best as possible in the situation. her response was to turn her back to me, walk away and stand by the register, as if to imply that her job is done and i need to check out. no attempts to fix anything, or improve anything. she literally walked over and leaned on the register counter and started staring out the front windows. of note, she also didn't say a single thing to me during the haircut. no ""how's your day"", ""any plans for the holidays"", etc. she just wanted to get the haircut over with. i believe the haircut lasted 7 minutes total..i still plan on going to great clips, as i've had great experiences in the past. i've definitely let store managers know when their stylists do great jobs and are very personable (i.e. maria at great clips on s halsted is phenomenal). but i felt the need to warn people about this stylist in particular."
"god why didn't i read these reviews first!!! horrible what a joke this place is they should be ashamed of themselves and they're not ""stylists"" there butchers. my hair was beautiful before walking into this place and i should have walked out the min this guy said they don't flat iron or style just damp blow dry. i always go to great clips so i figured this place would be fine. hey jerk off if you don't know what an inch is look down your pants. i specifically said 1 inch not 10. my hair was as long as my arm now it's a little longer then shoulders length. i stopped him 5 times and told him he was cutting it to short and then he wants to argue with me!!! are you kidding me!!!!! then has the nerve to say is it ok do i have a choice anymore.  stay away from this place you give all great clips and quick service salons a bad name"
"want a cheap haircut, expect a cheap result.....i went to see gilma today who gave me what might have been the worst haircut of my life. i don't need much as i'm a 2 on the sides and needed a general trim. my bangs are completely uneven as she chose to cut it without using the brush to ensure evenness. it turned out completely uneven with a gap in the middle. i asked her to please even out the front and she free eyed it again. now my bangs are   short compared to the rest of my hair and still uneven. i'm going to another shop to see if they can fix this mistake as i can't go into a work setting looking like this. if you need a buzz cut, sure come here. if you're a business person, i'd avoid."
"what's so great about great clips, i ain't never goin back againcut my bangs down to the quiff, made me look like a lesbiansittin in that chair with a thousand yard stair, anything to kill timegot a b***** names sally byrd, committing a hate crimei tipped you too, tanya. how you gonna mess up a 4 guard with a 2 guard - unless you're rick pettinos trying to play zone defense.-db"
"luis was fantastic! i was in town for a conference and in desperate need of a haircut, this was open until 6 and walking distance. the staff was courteous and professional, i showed luis a picture of what i wanted and he got it done in 20 minutes, with quick precision. he was a consummate professional and i could not be happier. i've had haircuts that were twice as expensive and took twice as long and were only half as satisfying! would definitely recommend. great quality for a great value"
"less than average. in first place i never felt welcome and was never greeted well on arrival. haircut was decently done - but below expectations. it was a dry experience overall.on review of the recent haircut after the shower, i  noticed it was a cut horribly done..completely uneven on my head and very unprofessionally dealt with..cant believe i even tipped for this..never going back there.."
stay away from luis. he seriously messed up my hair. the couple of other times i am cut my hair here i have had no issues but this time was really bad.
"we went there to get my husband a much required haircut. checked in online beforehand which is great. you get coupon for a dollar off with your receipt so don't forget to bring it next time. they have a regulars card as well where you collect points and you get a free haircut after a particular points value. now about haircut, my husband is hard to please when it comes to his hair but he was satisfied with the cut. we will be going there again surely. i think it's a good place for male haircuts with a decent price of 15$ only. with coupons and points it gets even better."
"went i for a cut before important meeting, the guy who cut it just lopped it off as i wasn't even facing mirror, i always go to great clips in columbus and had to get it recut the next day when i was home. my regular stylist said ""how long did he take, five minutes??? what did he use to cut it??"" she was able to restyle it the way it should look and i will never go back to the one in chicago. had to pay for two cuts in one week but second one worth it."
"the staff was courteous. the experience was the same as any other great clips i've gone too. quick, affordable, and friendly. i was glad that this location was near my hotel as i needed a last minute haircut."
"my hair is easy to cut and i'm not super anal about my hair anyway. the lady that cut my hair never attempted to talk to me, which didn't really bother me but a simple ""hello, how are you?"" would have been nice. she cut my hair exactly how i wanted and was done in about 10 mins. i'm all about saving time when it comes to haircuts. i have much better things to do then sit in that chair and wonder what the hell is the blue stuff the combs sit in comprised of."
they have new staff who i guess are first timers. they are generally good but i had a bad experience last time
john did a great job .. in and out fastreasonably priced  in a good location
"my hair is kind of sad--it's thin, long, straight, i dye it with the same $7 box of hair dye every 6 weeks, and i don't have any layers in it. so i balk at the prospect of spending $50+ on a haircut. this is why i love great clips--cheap, quick, and gets the job done. granted, because i have long hair and i just get 1.5inch trims, there's a very low likelihood that someone can mess it up. i'm not sure i would come here for anything more complicated than that. i went for the first time today to this brand new location, and i'm glad i did. there was actually a 40-minute wait, but they happily took down my name and i left to go shopping for a bit. when i came back, i got right in. amber was a great stylist--extremely friendly and helpful. today they were running a $9.99 special--i'm not sure how long that extends. one of these days, i should probably realize that i'm a ""professional"" and should pay good money for my hair. until then, there's great clips."
debbie was great! i'd gone way too long without a cut (months) and needed a quick cut before an 11am gig. i didn't know anywhere else i could get a quick walk in so i apprehensively went here. so glad i did! i've gotten $60 cuts routinely in the past but debbie made my cut look just as good for $15! plus! i checked in on fb as a newbie and got $5 off! so boom: $10 hair cut and a new go-to stylist.
"needed a quick haircut so i walked in without an appointment and was assigned to this guy..he was so unskilled and clumsy with the razor/scissors, he must have at least grazed my neck area 2-3 times!  at one time, he even grazed my ears so badly that it started to bleed..no apologies whatsoever and he didn't even bother cleaning up the blood..haircut was pretty bad too..wasn't happy with it at all..reminded me why i avoid places like this...i did't catch his name, but he's of hispanic origins i think...avoid!"
probably the worst salon ever. i tried three different people at this place and they are sucked.
"you get what you pay for at great clips.  i've been to them twice and they either cut it too short or too long, and don't bother asking me if i like it or not.  i realize they're one of the bargain basement hair salons, but i've been to hair cuttery many times, and they've always done a stellar job.  the difference is communication, which the great clips stylists need to learn."
"i went to joe's barbershop in chicago for a few years, and while i appreciated the great work by joe and his cadre of barbers, i got to a point where i didn't have 2 hours to give to wait in line for a haircut.i have been going to this great clips for over a year now. it's close to work and i really like being able to check in online and then jump in a chair right when i get there. i've had quite a few different women cut my hair and all have done a great job. $17 is fair price and they have haircut sales now and then, which is nice. highly recommend if you have easy to cut hair and need to get in and out quick."
worst haircut i've ever had. i'm not sure the lady that cut my hair could be trusted with a steak knife.
horrible is the word. a young lady did the haircut. no sectioning of the hair just snipping from any directions. without a doubt it turned out asymmetrical. never going back.
"i been coming to this greatclips for over a year and it's always been a great experience. online check-in is useful, it will save you time! my stylist ariana is absolutely amazing! she is super friendly, professional, and she understands what you want. i will definitely recommend this great clips to a friend."
had a great experience at the great clips at presidential towers. the staff was very friendly plus the cut was great. this is definitely going to be my go to spot for a haircut!
this is my second time coming to this location. great experience both time. first time i had monica and this second time i had ariana. both great! will definitely come back again.
"i'm a huge fan of this place for a three main reasons: 1. the location is amazing for those that work in the area2. checking in ahead of time via the app or their website is incredibly convenient and a huge time saver3. in my experience the stylists there do an amazing job and are super friendlyi typically go after work on thursdays while danny and/or sam are working - one or the other has been cutting my hair every few weeks for a little over a year now and i am always satisfied with how their cuts turn out. i'll switch my hair style up every now and then and they are both very good at hearing me out for what i'm looking for and translating it into a finished product. danny actually cut and styled my hair in the weeks leading up to my wedding in march 2016 and i will forever be grateful, i received numerous comments on how polished it looked. as long as they are working at this location it will continue to be my go-to hair cut stop!"
"efficient check in process with their online app. they get super busy during peak times, like lunch and 5pm, so definitely download the app and check in online. at times they will sell their ""great card"" where you can pre-purchase haircuts for $9.99. if you are regular customer, this is a great value."
"super convenient location. really nice people, you can tell the owner really cares and it flows from there."
"ok seriously all these chain haircut places are the same right?  super cuts, great clips, hair cutlery?  yes!   well, usually...that is, unless  you visit this particular great clips.  i feel these chains all hire the latest licensed stylists right off the hair-u bus, the good ones get experience and move to a  fancy salon.  if thats really the case, this location has amazing campus recruiters b/c all the stylists are awesome!  but, what is more likely realistic is here you have quality experienced stylists and not newbies.  thankfully that means you won't have the roll-the-dice after check-in and hope you get the good one experience - here they're all great!!!  disclaimer:  i'm not 24 anymore and wearing the latest bieber or whatever is trending hair style, nor do i have the same amount of hair i had when i was 24 (damn you propecia side effects...) so all i require is a pretty simple cut and they do an amazing job.bonus: near work and open early and can check wait time online?  score!  did i just get excited about a chain haircut place...? don't tell anyone, mmmmkay?"
"i have low expectations for any kind of great clips, super cuts, sport clips, or any other mass-produced high volume places where guys can get a haircut for 10 bucks. and, yeah i still only go to those places.   but, seriously, this is the worst great clips i've ever been to.   both times i've been there, my hair came out looking totally uneven, and the salonists who work there were super spacey and bordering on rude.   only redeeming feature to this place is that it's close to work. even the great clips on elston ave is far better."
"hair cut was ok however the hair dresser messed up my side locks as she was in a hurry to finish up & attend to other customers. this was my second time so i would not recommend this place to anyone. the first time experience was just fine, hair dresser was a bit curt but i guess it has to do with the fact that this is a big chain so they do not really care. now the second time they have really messed up big time - went there the second time only because i live in pt.will not recommend this place to anyone."
"i'm a fan. great value haircuts for $16, and the barbers are friendly. this venue fulfills both location and speed, with very experienced salonists. on a weekday evening, most of the customers were male. i wish i remembered my barber's name.will be back."
"where do i start. i'm on a student budget and have been going to this establishment for years because the prices are under $20. today was the last time i step foot in great clips. the hot and ready of haircuts has officially pushed me away. over the years i've had a few minor issues but i've always gone back because mistakes happen (and i'm broke) but this is it. my hair is pretty easy to cut. 2 on the sides and leave it longer on top. they save your information in their system because turnover at these places are higher than 2012 gas prices. this lady called my name and right away i knew i was f*****. she was dressed like we were at underground on a saturday night. she confirmed what i wanted (2 on the sides and longer on top) but said ""eh that doesn't look good, i got you"". she didn't ""get me"" guys. this chick went ham on my head. cut the hell out of it like she was salt bae and i was some lean sirloin fresh out the grill. i kept telling her over and over to please keep it long but she wasn't listening. all she was hearing was snip snip snip snip snip. i couldn't jump out of the chair because i didn't want to walk out with half a hair cut, but now i realized i should have done that. i started to give in and looked into her eyes noticing that my displeasure was kind of turning her on. it was as if she took a lawnmower to my head.  i don't know what i did to deserve this. finally she stopped cutting my hair and she ran to get hair gel. i told her ""no please don't i'm about to go home and shower"". she didn't care, she dumped a bucket of pomade on my head and made me look like a jersey shore character. at this point, i wanted to cry. i was about to jump from the seat but she held me down and started shaving my eyebrows( no joke). i started laughing uncontrollably and i begged her to stop. ""nope, i'm not letting you leave here with these eyebrows like that"". i finally escaped fearing that she was going to shave my legs and arms. paid with no tip and ran out. i currently look like a circumcised penis but i've learned my lesson. spend $20 guys. god bless."
"yup i am giving this review 5 stars - as good as it gets. before i moved back to chicago i hadn't paid for a hair cut in over 2 years. my friend was a stylist. she would cut my hair every two weeks if not every week and never charged me for it. i cringed at the thought of someone else cutting my hair - screwing it up - and having to pay for it.well i went to a few places before i visited the west loop great clips. i originally had danny cut my hair. he was good, had great conversation, and was pretty consistent. life wasn't so bad. then one day i met sam. she cut my hair since danny wasn't available. i was immediately in love with the cut. she was great, easy going, and best of all took the direction i gave her and made my hair look awesome.however, its not just her talent that is making me come back consistently. her customer service is exceptional and it shone through during my last visit. my last visit i decided to take a sunday run to do my errands. before i got to great clips i severely sprained my ankle but was still able to hobble to the store front (barely). sam went above and beyond during this visit. after she cut my hair she took a break and assisted me to wal-mart. she insisted i rested while she got the appropriate aids to take care of my ankle.  she went above and beyond and i am forever grateful.thanks again sam! you made a customer for life!"
"lately i have been choosing businesses that are conveniently located to either work or home. this great clips fit the bill and they are synonymous for affordable haircuts. i gave them a chance and i was very pleased with my first trim. jasmine put my previous 30 plus dollar haircut to shame.this recently opened location on madison sits a street level connected to one the presidential towers. very clean as one would expect, brand new build, and welcoming staff. you can check-in online and arrive within 20 minutes and you get to hop the line. almost like an appointment but different. if you can't check beforehand your name gets added to the queue when you arrive. i haven't had to wait more than 10 minutes at this location after work. the stylist keeps notes on each visit so there is no guessing the next time you come in. they pay attention to the details and provide you with what you want. this is important when providing a service and they do it well.men's haircuts run $15.99 and they seem to hand out coupons on the street often. first time at his location? your next visit will run you $6.99. they also offer a prepaid gift card providing 5 cuts for $49.99 and you get that haircut free when purchasing. you do the math it's a good deal."
"i found this gem about a block away from ogilve transportation center, where i work. i walked in and was immediately taken care of. my haircut was fast, cheap, and exactly aligned with my specifications. i am pleased with the results, and will make a return appearance!"
"the hairstylist sam is great here.  she understands what you want.  she is careful, efficient, and friendly."
"i passed by at saturday and asked about something they told me it called "" outline trimming""i went there today and asked for the "" outline trimming "" and told him i don't want to cut my hair cuz i want to grow it tall but he gave me a haircut. i kept telling him that i only want the outline trimming and he kept saying he have to cut a little bit so it blind in. then he called it a misunderstanding and wanted to charge me for the haircut ...i think this is my last visit to them"
worst salon ever !! you would rather not visit this place !! only this store at presidential towers is bad other great clips stores are better !! the staff come up with lamest excuses not to take up appointments ... bad customer service !!
"environment: (1/5)only one employee at the time. there was a man sitting directly behind you in a small room with security cameras, staring at you and the stylist the entire time. very awkward and i felt very uncomfortable.  very small space and felt cramped. service: (4/5)stylist was great.  gave me recommendations based off my style and the products i use. very helpful and was very thorough. appreciated the time she put into giving me a haircut that i liked. pricing (2/5)with tip this cut cost me around twenty bucks. i'm sorry but if i'm going to a greatclips, then i'm going for affordability."
"terrible experience, maryan golzanez a name like this...she ruined my hair!she cut my hair so bad i am very very very very sad with her work. dont go there"
"walked in with no wait. hair cut with alex started immediately and went really well. she was professional, nice, and made me very comfortable. the hair cut looks good too! will definitely be going back."
"i've been coming here for about 4 months and usually they're pretty consistent. however, today is the final straw. today, i think they have a new hire and she completely destroys my hair. i had a combover look and in 5 minutes she turns it into a fohawk/mohawk. wtf?! i told her i wanted a one on the sides and thin out the top keeping the same length. literally i can not emphasize how simple the cut can be. i give people the benefit of the doubt but she just uses the razor and shaved away. in my mind, i knew i wasted ~15 dollars. maria is the only best stylist for men's haircut, but i was never fortunate enough to actually book an appointment with her. but seriously, bruh do you guys hire ladies who says they know how to cut hair and they actually don't? do you even train them? my hair legit looks almost like puck's hair from glee! how can you mess it up!!!!! how?!?!?!?!? peace out great clips."
"terrible. short latino lady cut my hair and literally the entire time would not stop critiquing my hair! yes i know i have split ends... which is why im here. i never once asked her her opinion yet from start to finish she kept making rude comments about my hair cut, dye job, and apparent damage. like calm down, thats no way to treat a customer.horrible experience."
"i didn't even want to give one star. i never do bad reviews but the ""workers"" here didn't have the courtesy to greet me at the door. she insisted on engaging in her conversation rather than assisting the customer. i see why there was no one in the facility. you would think they're closed because the barbers are not working. terrible service. matter of fact i can't even say that because i wasn't serviced. they probably would have jacked me up anyway."
"i highly suggest you make an appointment to come here because you'll find yourself waiting 40-60 minutes after lunch hours. you can make an appointment online and it's super easy. all of the barbers are great and they all have their own ways of cutting hair. my hair style is super easy, i usually just get the fade with a scissor cut on top and these guys do an excellent job with it. it's $13 without tip. you can walk over from uic, or meter park on halsted. make sure you make an appointment otherwise you'll be sitting their bored for an hour."
"bad experience!i have been coming to this great clips (our family) for years and the experience we've had worsened throughout the years (it is close to home). we purchased a great clips card (with discount) and each time when my teenage daughter comes in for a haircut (twice),the card machine does not work. first, they don't tell you that it does not work when you come in, when her haircut was done they told her the card machine is not working and my daughter felt so embarrased (the staff were all just standing around her talking to each other that she should be charged full price without consideration [she can hear them talking like she was not there- rude and without manners]) and they insisted that she pay the full price. second, they have poor choice of staff (beware!). the people who have been working here definitely lack customer service. we will not be coming back. we would rather travel a couple of miles than go back to this salon in halsted st. it won't be missed. i would not recommend this place, you can find other salon with reasonable price with ""fine"" customer service."
"i generally review after a few times to get a better understanding of a business. in general they do their job, simple and quick. i recently had two haircuts there and found one of their employees to be racist. this is a very bad way to treat customers. there are other employees who are mexican who treat customers better. i would suggest great clips management to better train employees on social diversity as they clearly lack experience in communication towards a multicultural group of customers."
"this place is a total joke! check-in online only to arrive and have them take walk-in after walk-in ahead of us. brought my three sons in for haircuts and it took 20 minutes of arguing because i would not register them under their own phone numbers. who the hell are they, the nsa? the woman told me that they need it ""to monitor their haircuts."" i told them they do not need my childrens' phone numbers nor do they need to monitor my childrens' haircuts. then today was the last straw. i checked in online and arrived only to have them take walk-ins ahead of me, again. bye, felicia."
"dont go to this place, one african american woman fucked up my hair.... donot go here, and donot deal with her.peace"
"very nice job. i am actually very particular about my bangs and length. based on the reviews i was hesitant at first but given my budget and the convenience of location, i gave this place a shot. honestly, if you want ombres and the fancier services then go somewhere else. for $13, i was delighted that i could get the same quality and style cut i paid $35-50 at my regular salon. even if it's just a trim and style cut. i had julia and she was great. i waited about 5 minutes before being seen and julia took less than 20 minutes to finish my style. quick, simple and affordable place. but be aware that their services and capacity are limited."
i needed a haircut and found this place while driving by one day at about 11:00am on a weekday. my hair is curly and i wear it medium length. i did not have a wait. fern spoke to me and asked me what i wanted. she took the time to show me some pictures. she gave me a great layered cut. she had good suggestions and was very attentive. i paid $13.00 for the cut. i also bought a good product she recommended for my frizzy hair.i advise anyone who is on a budget and needs a decent haircut to give this place a try.
"i have short hair. i don't need to spend more than $15 for a haircut. came here on a weekday morning where they have a $10 haircut deal if it's before noon. if you come here after then or during the weekend, i believe it's $14. since i'm a guy and my hair is short, it was done quickly and efficiently. if you need a fancier cut and you believe you're high maintenance, go to paul mitchell across the street and do all that head massage and such. how do you if you're high maintenance? one way to tell is check your bottle of shampoo and see if you paid $50 or not for it. if you have a family size head and shoulders from costco because you thought it was a good deal or your mom bought it for you, then this place is for you. fyi, my wife buys my shampoo.   if you like to keep it simple and short, walk-ins are welcomed. it's a haircut. it will grow back if you are unhappy with it. i was happy with after my first visit. as long as they don't spit in my hair, i'm good. i will see all you fellow head and shoulder shampooers here in the future. all others, i'll see you crossing the street to the paul mitchell. who the heck is paul mitchell anyways? he's madonna's stylist or something?"
"for the last 2 years i walk down to this location about every 10 days to get a buzz cut, very simple and quick. the last 6 times i have waited close to an hour and have had at least 3-4 people go ahead of me that checked in online. if you don't appreciate walk ins then take it off your advertisement. additionally i always get a hair cut and shampoo and can't remember not paying at least 25 bucks, because they work hard. they are way to under staffed and i will no longer be coming here. the manager obviously does not care about customers"
i've been very happy with my haircuts from cecilia here.  she listens and cuts my hair better than much pricier salons. and i've had terrible experiences across the street at paul mitchell.
"first of all, why the heck are you looking at great clips! there is a wonderful paul mitchell's *right across the street*. if you need a haircut more complicated than a buzz, call up paul mitchell's and book an appointment with their level 2 trainees (about to graduate). it costs 15$ and will be one of the best haircuts you can get in chicago.so why do i come to great clips? because i'm lazy and don't need to make an appointment. i get a 4 on top and a 2 on the sides and i'm done with it - 20 to 30 minutes on a saturday. even that can be a bit dodgy though (how can you not cut my hair evenly using a freakin' buzzer!)."
"great clips is, as a chain, nothing special.  but today, i was in the neighborhood, and needed a quick haircut.  cecilia was friendly, efficient, and left me with a respectable looking haircut.  here's a hint for folks-- don't expect a $100 haircut for $13.  you get what you pay for.  these quick mchaircut places never promised you a $100 cut.    but, if you're fairly low-maintenance, are looking a bit of a beast and need your 'do' trimmed, this great clips will meet your needs."
"i come here every 2-3 weeks to get my fade or faux hawk done by maria or whoever is on staff.  the girls all have their different methods of giving fades, but the end result is normally pretty good.  they keep your ""style"" in their computer so when you come back they already know what kind of hair cut you normally get.  while the price of $13 for a haircut is high for a fade, they do a good job overall so i can't complain.  depending on when you arrive, there could be a 15-20 min wait, but again it depends if you come after work which could be busier, or just during a weekday (9-5) its not so busy.overall for the type of hairstyle i get, they do a great job."
"just took my nearly 3-year old boy in for a haircut and was very happy with the result.  his hair is fine and curly, and i wanted to keep the curls but shape it up.  the woman (leticia?) was nice and patient and she did exactly what i asked her to do.  she also trimmed my 1-year old's bangs. total cost was $11. i should add that i've always taken my boys to snippets or kid snips in the past (yeah, i know), and this was just as good.  will definitely keep coming back."
"this place is great. i use their app to reserve a spot for my haircut, and i never have to wait more than five minutes after i get there to get started (frequently i don't have to wait at all). the stylists are great at what they do, and they're always friendly. the affordable price is great, too!"
"style: mid-long face frame with long layers, rounded back, and point cut. when i was checked my hair at the end of the cut, sue assured it was beautiful and perfect for me.  once i got home to check again with better lighting, i noticed the back was jagged, the layers were choppy, and no point cutting was used.  so i went back to get it fixed.  sue assured me she did it correctly and used a point cut method.  she kept defending the cut, and saying it was fine.  thankfully, edith was kind enough to fix my hair.  she apologized for sue's attitude, and did exactly what i asked for.  edith made nice conversation and wanted to make sure everything was the way i wanted it to be.  my hair looks great now.  she also gave a coupon for the whole mishap.  next time i'll be requesting edith to cut my hair."
so i came in for a hair cut for my son for school pictures tomorrow. he grew his hair for the past 4 months to be able to get it styled the way he wanted. this lady went took it to about 2 inches from his scalp! i'm so livid! the ugly hair phase he had to go thru just to do it all over again. uugghhhjoel's hair cut came out great. the white haired lady does a great job.
"hi, i visit to great clips once a month. you cannot beat the parking, there's plenty of it.my stylist this time was kristina. i had never had her before. she seemed to know a lot about cutting hair and gave me plenty of interesting advice. in the end i walked out with a haircut that i really liked. you cannot beat the price of a cut here and you never have to wait very long. i liked kristina and would sign up with her again."
"sloppy cuts, don't go. uneven neck line, got one sideburn cut higher than the other. also i've never been able to see the same stylist. there's always new faces. other than that they're fine but won't be returning."
"samantha cut my hair well, chatted up the bristol renaissance faire, video games, and the angst of adulthood. friendly staff and good value. other favorite stylists are sue, diana, and esperanza (hope i spelled that right)."
"my new go to place for haircuts since i moved to bridgeport. everyone is always nice, i always get served quick, the quality of my haircuts are always good, i def recommend!"
"one of the worst great clips in the states. the inexperienced stylist does not even care about what customer says. the just want to finish up early that's it and go home. she didn't even spend 10 minutes for hair cut, according to them greatclips is supposed to work  very fast. she even told me don't tell me what i have to do and don't argue."
"my last visit about a month ago i arrived before 1pm was told i could get the early bird price.  sue cut my hair and when i got ready to pay, she said i got there later & charged me the higher price.  i also heard her whisper to the other stylist to charge customers the higher price.  i thought that sounded rather unprofessional,  especially since i could hear her.  she used to be customer friendly.   she will never cut my hair again.   she always seems to like to use the shaver without asking if it's okay.   it burns my skin."
"i had such an awful experience here yesterday. i have been growing my pixie out for the majority of the year, so all i needed was the back trimmed and i wanted it thinned out a little. i had gotten my hair cut here before by this stylist, i wish i knew her name. she told me very rudely that thinning it was wrong, and i politely told her i prefer how it lays when it's thinned out. long story short i walked out of here with the back 3 inches of my hair shaved and the top left long. i was literally in tears when i got home and saw how bad it was. i was forced to go to another salon to get it fixed and the stylist laughed and said it looked like a mushroom. the only way she could fix it was to cut in back into a pixie. all the time i spent growing my hair down the drain..and stupid me still tipped this woman. the other stylists are very nice,  but i will never come here again after yesterday."
"it's last minute on sunday at 5pm and this was basically my only option. i think this place is only good for simple haircuts. i went in there with hair up to my butt and the shortest length past my shoulders. i specified that i wanted it cut shorter in a simple v-shape, no crazy layers, to have the length at about my bra strap and the shortest starting below my chin. i got off the chair with the length i wanted but the shortest was above my chin. there were basically two noticeable layers-nowhere near v-shape and was not even. i'm not one to complain about a haircut but as soon as i walked out of there i cried my eyes out. never have i ever had such a bad haircut experience. i was told i didn't have to pay and was offered to come back the next day to have it fixed. honestly i'm going to pass. i'm not going to chance it and rather go to my usual stylist. i thank the lady for spending so much time on my hair because there was so much of it and it's thick. but i will never go back to any great clips again."
"the older lady was so rude! my boyfriends haircut turned out soooooo ugly. i asked politely for her to trim the bangs and she questioned if i was a stylist and if i even know about styles. i'm like can you trim it? she raised her voice and said no no no no no no thats the style. idk what style that is, but the haircut is ugly. when she was fixing my boyfriends haircut, she was so rude and kept on instigating an argument. i don't even know why!!! the chinese lady cut better hair."
"this place is unprofessional.  the manager eddy is a thief.  she will take your money for a gift card and not give you credit.  she is dishonest.  the owner marylou pretends not to know that the staff is stealing, but won't do anything to change it.  don't trust these people with your credit cards."
i was not at all satisfied. first- i only went here because it was close and i needed a desperate trim. i got there and the wait was fine.. the staff was friendly and the facility was clean! i checked in at the front desk and asked for a wash and cut. when it was my turn - the last took me straight to the chair without washing my hair at all! (at the time it wasn't a big deal because i had showered the night before.) my haircut took about 5 minutes (which is unusual because i had hair halfway down my back and it's super thick). at the time it looked fine but who really knew.. i got home and went to put my hair in a braid and bam!! my hair is uneven and all these hairs stick out and aren't long enough to complete the braid. the next day i straightened my hair and could see the unevenness and physically had to take scissors and even it out. needless to say i will never be going back here and i suggest you just stick to a salon that you know will provide you with a great service.
"walked in and was immediately attended by sammi. i had a great experience and will be definitely coming back. i had curly thick hair that was hard to manage, especially with a toddler running around. sammi took in what i felt and she worked miracles on my hair. she gave me a long bob cut and made my hair soft and easy to style. it's so light weight and fun. she made great conversation and made me feel very comfortable considering i was cutting my hair short for the first time. she attended to my every concern and answered all of my questions. thank you sammi for my amazing new hair!"
"paid $12 for a cut and wash which turned out to be great, listened to exactly what i wanted and gave me the perfect haircut! thanks josephine"
"alma rocks! not all listen and are as talented, but now i ask for her exclusively. i'm a regular at this location."
"love this place!!! all of the barbers are outstanding and fast, especially edith! overall, this place is nevet busy and always consistent no matter what time you come!!!"
"online check in available. very nice hairdressers. quick quick service. just the way i like it. i also love how they have my last haircut details saved in their system. definitely use the app. also, great price."
"i have curly hair which many stylist have a hard time cutting because they are unexperienced. at great clips i love going there because sue the stylist knows exactly what to do with my curly hair. she understands maybe because she too has curly hair, lol. that helps also i can tell she is an experienced hair stylist. i only go when she is there, keep up the great work sue!"
"the stars aligned on my first visit to this great clips location in lincoln square. i got a good quick haircut from a stylist who was professional, friendly, and polite. and it was cheap.random factors worked in my favor. susana was the stylist on duty. her work was efficient and correct. clearly, this young woman has good training and experience. she's is also friendly, personable, and bright. i happen to like smart people, especially when there's no escape. you know what i mean, fellow yelpers. you're a prisoner in that chair while the stylist works. being forced to listen to a someone's inane chatter, especially when it's punctuated with ""like"", ""you know"", ""basically"", or any other filler words, will drive you nuts. susana was articulate, bright, and personable. i actually enjoyed chatting with her.things that could go wrong with a visit to great clip went right with me. susana was on duty by herself, and she had no customers when i arrived. that was great for me, because i didn't have to wait. but i imagine it could be a different situation if several customers come in around the same time, and there's only the one stylist working. there could definitely be a serious wait.susana mentioned that business is slower on a cold day, and the day of my visit was frigid. also, i went on a weekday morning, a time that typically is slow. i can't speak to how busy great clips is at other time, but considering that there are six work stations, the place must get busy.i paid $13.00 for a cut and blow dry that i liked very much. there is an additional charge if you want your hair washed. it's rare for me to give any business a 5-star rating, but i don't have one single criticism of my great cuts experience.just one thing, which is not the fault of the business -- the parking lot is metered! you do have to pay for parking. that's one thing that has always annoyed me about visiting the businesses in this small strip mall. as a long-time chicagoan, i hate hate hate paying for parking. i parked on a side street and walked a block. no biggie."
i went in with my 11 month old baby today. and he has serious hair growth every few months. wanted to give great clips as try. i normally get it done from another local barber. i understand my baby will cry his lungs out and hates getting his haircut but never has my kid ever had a horrible haircut. the lady at the counter told me how the stylist was a pro at cutting baby hair. my baby's first birthday is around the corner and i dont know what to do. the front is uneven. and has huge dents. the sides are unevenly faded. its a disaster. had another guy complaining while i was there that the stylist went too high .
"i went in spur-of-the-moment because i really wanted a haircut immediately and no one else was open or available before 10 am. the haircut was pretty bad. not quite even and with a chunk of hair shorter in the back. i pointed this out to the hairdresser, who insisted it was just layers. i didn't make a big deal out of it because my hair grows out pretty fast and i never stress about it. but she knew -- she couldn't even look me in the eye when i paid. on the upside, the shampoo included a very nice scalp massage."
"i desperately needed my long hair cut, but my regular salon was closed. i wanted 4"" cut off in long layers and bangs trimmed. i searched around for salons that were open after 7pm. i called ahead & was told i could walk-in. hours are super convenient! online reservations are available. i walked there, but there is ample car parking. extremely clean & bright. very friendly staff. i discussed what i wanted with susana. she skillfully cut my hair exactly as i requested. i could not be more satisfied with the result! i highly recommend susana at this salon. i was regularly going to a small, independent salon for many years, but it closed permanently. i work late, and needed a salon with hours that fit my schedule. i have had my haircut at a franchise salon once or twice in my life, because of convenience, but it's not my preference. i was so happy with my experience here that i have decided to make this my new regular salon. why would i pay boutique salon prices when i can get a beautiful style and great customer service for less?convenient & affordable!"
"great price, nice hair cuts, talented employees. if your hair cut is pretty straight forward, this is the place to go!"
had a great haircut yesterday. my haircut is a bob style and its actually never looked better!! thanks for the great haircut and excellent customer service.
"been going here for a while. really like the girls that work there. they are friendly & accomidating. my hair dresser's name is belkis. she really knows how to cut hair. even thou i moved to the burbs, i will make the trip in just to get my hair cut here. prices are reasonable, place is clean. love it."
friendly staff and bekys took care of me. very professional and very experienced. also friendly and made me feel welcomed. great haircut!!
"stopped in yesterday and had a boy's cut by susana. she did a terrific job, was personable and really knows what she's doing, would give 6 stars if we could! will definitely be back!"
"a perfectly fine place to get in and out for a hair cut.  employees are kind and somewhat efficient.   prices are inline with the going rate for a chain haircut in the area.  place is clean.    you can check in online to avoid the wait, but there is usually not much of a queue even on the weekends.   no free parking, which is a bit of an annoyance."
took my daughter here today for her first shampoo and cut. sonia was great made my daughter comfortable. franchise that feels like neighborhood salon. love app with check in.  parking lot with meters available
"what a great, friendly neighborhood spot for a haircut."
the lady was very nice. she did a good job and i was taken care of promptly. we're good here.
"okay, let's start with what you're probably thinking -  it's a great clips so the cuts aren't that good. and maybe you're thinking that this is just another chain coming to take out the independent shops in lincoln square.and to you folks, i say - you're probably right. howeveri rather enjoyed the cut i received at this location. the shop is brand new, so everything was fresh and clean. the service was excellent (they brought in stylists from other great clips to easy the transition) and the online check in was actually pretty cool. instead of sitting there waiting for a cut, i checked in online and showed up exactly when it told me to and i was escorted right to a chair in front of other people. it's a time saver. as for the not so good cuts, i think if you like your hair cut a particular way or want to pamper yourself a bit, this wouldn't be the right place. but for me, a guy who just wants a short fade cut, it's perfect. i was in and out in 20 minutes, didn't feel robbed when it came time to pay, and left knowing i'd be back."
"i only gave 3 stars because matthew was an awesome person and great customer service! i was a walk in and no one was there so was taken promptly. i gave him a great tip for him being so good at asking what i wanted; however, he cut my hair waaaaay too short! i can tell he knew he messed up and tried to cover it up, but by the end of my haircut, my head looked like a tennis ball with how he styled it. completely way off from what i wanted which was shoulder length hair with texture at the bottoms and swept bangs.  he's an awesome guy and probably cuts men's hair better since he said he has a lot of experience cutting men's hair. i should've listened to my intuition and stuck with my salon with the high prices but great results. the good thing about hair is that it grows... but never again going to a great clips!"
i have nothing but raves for this location!! i walked in and got the exact cut i wanted by jj. he is awesome!!! thanks for my new look! i will be back!
i was in the area running errands. i dont know why but i finally wanted to get my haircut. i walked in and debbie took me right away. she is so friendly and did a great job on my hair. it's a bit of a drive from home but i'm definitely coming back to have debbie cut my hair.
"they have been amazing with my severely dd son. he is cooperative but it takes a few tries to get him to understand basic instructions, and he tends to like to look around and sing loudly with the radio. they are so patient and kind yet his haircut takes no longer than anyone else's and ends up perfect. he loves it so much there that he's become brand loyal and won't go anywhere else. he has specific stylists that even want to work with him now which is so sweet, and they all do a fabulous job.they also did an amazing job with my teen daughter as well, who showed a photo on her phone of some funky cut. i wasn't sure a chain was the place to go - it was so specific and she's very particular - but it ended up amazing, took like 20 minutes tops, and she was so happy with it. she's gone back for variations and every time, it's just what she wants. there is a little section of the waiting area set aside for kids with books, a few toys in decent condition/clean, and the online check in is definitely the way to go if you don't want to wait long or want to check times before you go. i cannot recommend them more highly. just pay the parking...it's pay to park although great clips has nothing to do with that, be aware, that lot gets checked."
not sure what the $9.99 advertisement is but i was told $13 when i asked about $9.99?free parking on sunday yea!
"nice lady to cut my hair! highly recommend if u need something simple and cheap, even a bit complex"
"i got my haircut here once. the people were nice and the woman who cut my hair did a good job for a great clips. if you want a great clips haircut, do not hesitate to come to this one : )also, as always, they accept walk-ins. it's the perfect place for when you must get your hair cut immediately or you'll find yourself streaking or stabbing the person next to you at that cafe with a plastic fork. you're going to be okay."
"three weeks ago, i got a haircut here on a whim and was underwhelmed. the stylist got both my first and last names wrong, even though i spelled them. i asked her to give my bangs attention, but she missed a spot altogether. and something wasn't right about the back...she'd chipped into the sides but left the center long. after pinning up my hair for three weeks, i was tired of compromising. i got a corrective bang trim elsewhere today (which ended up becoming a full-fledged cut), and it was then that i really saw all the mistakes in my hair. my stylist today had to take at least an inch off the back to fix it. i see a lot of good reviews here, so maybe i caught her on a bad day. but two haircuts in three weeks is too costly to take that chance again."
"good haircut but this is the second time i went in there and was assaulted by why trump is better than hilary.  i'm seeing ads everyday and so i don't need it from the stylists to.  and the stuff they are saying isn't even factual. just cut my hair, ugh.  two people left saying they would never go back, and i would make the third in a row.  i have always known never to talk about politics or religion with clients.  these two have no clue that they are running people out of the store with their attacks on hilary and unprofessional political vomit that is completely misinformed.  if any of my employees talked about politics to my clients it would be an automatic write up.  if three clients said they wouldn't be back because of them, they would be fired.  sportclips is just down the street, a little more expensive but i won't be assaulted be political ads."
a big thank you to the hairdressers who were there on 5/13! i went in to shave my head for medical reasons and they handled it such poise and understanding. had to leave quickly with just thank you because tears were coming fast.
"do not come here. i read the reviews on this place, and they were mostly bad, but i just get a simple cut--trim, long layers--so i figured i'd give it a try for a quick cut. the woman who cut my hair was nice, asked how i was, typical small talk. then, her phone rang while she was in the middle of cutting my hair. 1. why can i hear your personal cell phone ringing while you are at work? 2. she stopped, mid haircut to try to pick up the phone call, but she missed the call. 3. she called the person back, and had at least a 5 minute conversation. i was shocked. she came back, and apologized, but i didn't want to say anything until she finished cutting my hair. then, while she was finishing my haircut, the other stylist went in the back and was talking on her personal cell phone, which i could clearly hear the entire conversation.then, more customers walked in, so the other stylist came from the back, still on her phone, and my stylist told her in spanish, to hurry up and get off the phone because there are customers. the other stylist continued to talk on her phone for another minute before she greeted and helped them.my haircut is fine, but that kind of service is obscene, especially when the cut itself did not take longer than 10 minutes, but their conversations were obviously more important than their customers."
"i have used these guys a couple of times... never again. each time i come into this place their first questions/statement is not ""hello welcome to great clips"" or ""hi how are you today"" or ""haircut today?"" rather it is ""did you check in online?"" thats all fine and dandy. and its perfectly ok if you adhere to your own rules. the last times i have been there the person who checked in (person or online) was first. i checked in at home and it said clearly ""zero minute"" wait. i rode my bike and was there in under 10 minutes. i saw two people freshly sat down and their haircuts just begun. i also saw the normal ""check in"" monitor ominously turned off. then the stylist took time to help a customer by hairgel mid-haircut and their day went on. oblivious to their own rules for their own convenience. so two can play at this game. you have lost a customer for life. i will never return to this great clips again."
i've been coming here for years. never gotten a bad haircut (been to over 5 of there stylists). i started coming here when i lived in oak park. i have lived in lincoln park and now riverside and style get my hair cut here. thanks gclips oak park.
"i have been coming here for my 3boys for the last 5 years and the service has always been mediocre but this was the last straw. i checked in at 4:30 from home and the website allows me. i loaded my 3 boys into the car in the snow, arrived by 4:45 and they wouldn't take us for our haircuts!! their website specifically stated that i would be taken if i arrived before 5 which i did. so frustrating. so even though this place is in a convenient location, i won't be coming back. great job losing a 5 year longtime customer great clips oak park."
"i've gone to great clips at a different location and have zero problem. i came to this location after i moved and never again. the staff was fake friendly, and barely greeted me before asking if i wanted a cut. the other location asked what i wanted, if i wanted  a shampoo, and were super friendly. the woman who cut my hair didn't listen either, and cut it way too short. when she was done, i had to tell her that it was uneven. she evened it out, all the while saying it was how my hair was styled so it looked uneven. she also took two phone calls in the middle of my haircut! terrible service."
"finally found my hair stylist in oak park! for some reason all the barber shops in the area charge $30+ for a men's haircut. i get mine done about once every 3-4 weeks and a cut as straightforward as mine doesn't warrant an insane price tag. i found great clips through yelp, went in at 5:15 on a monday and was in a chair having my hair cut no more than 5 minutes later. my stylist, mary, was super friendly and cut my hair with zero effort. normally when i get a trim done, it takes a few days for it to look half decent even with globs of clay and pomade, but miraculously it looked great the moment i finished my post haircut shower. the haircut for a male is $13 so with tip it cost me $16. i have had few better haircuts than this and for the price, it's a serious bargain. hope i can improve this place's rep because it is definitely deserving of it! will be coming here again and again."
update: have since been back and gotten my hair cut by 2 other hairdressers and they did a great job!
"groupon users beware.  i'm a regular.  the cut is usually good- but this one time with a groupon- completely horrid. presented my coupon to the hair stylist- and blam everything changed.  here's what was completely different. 1- did not use the white tape around the neck to prevent hair from getting into shirt2- used a razor to trim sides, and trimmed off top by hand.  however did not trim edges around once, offer to even out my sideburns or use a mirror to show the back of my head. 3- total time for hair cut ~10 min.  previous visits were 15-18 min. 4- barely trimmed the top- i had to ask her to do a little more, which she did haphazardly. 5- did not offer hair gel (usually does). 6- at the end i was going to tip her as i always do- her response - ""oh, i'm sorry i didn't know you were going to tip.  i don't even know how to charge you for a tip"".  another 5 min later after getting another stylist to the computer she was able to charge me- at that point i was ready to give her zero. now, my previous visits- i'd give them 4 stars easily, they were solid cuts.  but with a groupon everything changes.  buyer beware."
i just received a haircut from mary (she has tattoos). the haircut is not bad but the experience was bad. she pulled my hair and gave off a cold rude vibe. don't get a haircut from her unless you're a masochist.
"i've been coming here for about a year and a half, and ana has been my stylist basically the whole time. she always does a great job, and i typically receive compliments whenever she cuts my hair. i would definitely recommend her."
"really like that you can log in from their app. never have to wait. all their staff are very skilled. i'm impressed that they keep track of how you like your hair cut, so your cut is just how you like it no matter which stylist cuts it. never had a bad haircut."
"honestly, i'd give zero stars if it were an option. brought in two 3 year olds for hair cuts. we've been before and have always been very satisfied. stylist didn't take her time, doesn't know how to communicate with children, both boys ended up with horrible, uneven hair cuts, the stylist took less then 10 minutes on both cuts combined. fall family photos have to be postponed because the cuts are that terrible. we will not be going back."
it's where i take my kids for their cuts.  it works.  i wouldn't my haircut there though.   they are quick and friendly.
mary just did me.  she pulled my hair jusst righhhht. ;-)
"is this the best haircut you can find in the op?  no, it is not.  however, the next better haircut costs $35 before a tip.i get in and out of great clips quickly, i don't need an appointment, and it costs only $12!  i pay $15 and i feel like mr. big shot big tipper.the women working there are a little quiet and shy (in my experience), but they don't mess around.  they are efficient and respectful.  they check in with me to make sure i haven't changed my preferences since my last visit.  and if i feel that something needs to be fixed at the end, they keep at it until it is done.one note about the great clips system...  it appears that they store certain information about how i like my hair, such as what length to set for the trimmers.  however, this isn't as effective as the great clips overlords probably think it is.  so many other aspects go into a haircut than you could easily store in a database in a retail environment.  you still need to hire skilled, experienced workers who know their way around many different heads of hair."
"wavered between 3 and 4, nothing fancy, but nice personable folks who give you a good value for the money.  my wife and i both have been here and we think it's a good place for a hair cut.  i would go back."
"america - great mens stylist! why spend $40-50 on a mens haircut? i've been seeing america regularly for about the last 1.5 years. she's the general manager, and is great and super friendly. i sometimes bring in pictures of what i want for a new style, and she goes right to it and does a fantastic job. price is unbeatable, $9.99 if you get in before noon on weekdays, otherwise it's $13.99. i go about every 2.5 weeks, so to me it makes sense financially. also, if you download their app, you can put your name on the list ahead of time and it's much easier to predict your wait time. of course, if you request a specific stylist, the wait can be a little longer than the estimated wait time they give you."
i usually have becca cut my hair (who is fantastic) was not in this evening so pierre had cut my hair.  he very friendly and professional.   i am very hair with my service that i had received from him  i would recommend him.
pretty much the worst hair cut i've ever gotten. i asked for an undercut and specifically told my stylist that both sides should have a part and not be blended. after taking off my glasses and letting her for her work for a while i out them back on to find that the top of my hair is blended my the left side to the right side with the left side being about an inch and a half longer. i pointed it out to her and she proceeded to try fixing it my cutting the right side even more. absolutely horrible cut. no questions were asked while cutting and no affirmation of what she was about to do was asked for. go somewhere else if you want anything more than a very simple trim.
"i go there sometimes for a blow dry. my hair is shoulder length and wavy. most of the time i'm pleased but today i was disappointed.when i got home after running around doing errands, i looked in the mirror and was so embarrassed when i realized i walked around the city with my hair looking like ""i"" didn't know what i was doing. i noticed a big portion of my hair looking frizzy so i put my hand through it to smooth it out when i realized a big portion on the side of my hair wasn't blow dried (straightened)- it was wavy and poofy underneath. my whole head was fine with the exception of one part, which was sticking out.today, i can honestly say my hair didn't look like i just stepped out of a salon. i had to finish straightening it myself. what did i spend $33 plus tip on? very disappointing."
received the worst haircut of my life. this cut is choppy and uneven all over my head. when she showed me my hair was soaking wet and i couldn't tell anything. i'm embarrassed that i waked around in public before i got home and realized this is what my hair looked like drywould give zero stars if possible.also want to point out that my husband got his hair done the same time and his looks great. so when i find out the lady's name who did mine i will be reaching out to corporate and posting it here.
"i had a horrible haircut experience here. i hate how expensive haircuts are, so i figured i'd give great clips a try. my stylist's idea of layering was just chopping off the front half of my hair (i think another reviewer posted a photo that looks pretty synonymous to my hair). if you want anything other than a buzz cut, i would go somewhere else."
the cut was well done.   i'm happy with the price and the good job the stylist did on my hair.   i'll be back.  :)
"to say i had a horrible experience at this salon is an understatement!!!!! i was in the chair about 45 seconds and during that time the hair stylist chopped 6 inches off my hair before i could even let him know that i wanted a litte trim. when i proceeded to stand up as i was extremely upset he pushed me back in the chair and told me he was almost finished (this was 60 seconds in to the appointment). when i starting asking ""what are you doing""  his only response was ""all your hair is dead"". as seen in the picture he not only cut my hair completely off he also cut it wrong, as one side is visibly longer than the other. the worst part of this entire experience is, i have been growing my hair to donate to a child i know who is desperate need of a wig. not only was this hair stylist rude and unprofessional, he robbed this little girl of a beautiful wig.  i have been crying now for a solid 24 hours due to this man's lack of kindness, professionalism and overall respect for his customer.  shame on this establishment."
i got a haircut from elia. it was the worst haircut. she probably doesn't know to do a proper haircut. my hair was cut so unevenly. such a frustrating experience
"hairstyler told my son he supposedly had lice, when he just had flakes from dry sculpting gel. very unprofessional and very loud he started saying he needed to sterilized the chair and his hands. i search my son hair and scalp and nothing, no lice! he ashamed us in the middle of the salon and in front of other clients. we left, crossed the street and went to another salon, they washed my son hair and cut it with no problems nor lice. definitely not coming back."
"elia gives the worst haircuts in the world! stay away!  america (yes, name of another stylist) is very good. go to her!"
"so sad to learn that luis is leaving the shop and going to the old town shop.  he wouldn't discuss why, but this site is losing my favorite hair cutter.  for the price you can't beat great clips.please bring luis back to broadway."
"employees are nice, but act like robots. they won't give you helpful suggestions and won't let you know if something is going to look bad. if you want a simple cut, great; if you actually want a specific cut or style, they will not do a good job. they are not paid to make you look good. they are only paid to cut hair."
"i've lived in the city for a while now, but never ventured out to find a place to get my hair cut. i visited gc a lot when i lived out in the burbs and being on a very tight budget, decided to give this one a shot. i'm very happy i did. first off, there was a promotion for a 5.99 haircut. it boggles my mind people spend over $40 for a cut, but must be nice for them. anywho, rebecca was the one cutting my hair and she did a wonderful job. i brought in a picture of what i wanted, she complemented the style, and went right to work. she asked be how short i wanted it to be a few times, and giving some recommendations along the way. when i've visited other gc locations, i felt as if the haircut was pretty rushed, and while she did get it done in a quick time, she also made sure it was turning out the way i wanted it to. at the end of it all, she also recommended me products, but didn't push me to buy anything from the salon, which is always nice. my hair feels and looks great and i'm very happy. i'm definitely a repeat customer now."
been using them for years. i think i stopped using supercuts across the street because they pissed me off at one time and i wasn't crazy about the hair cuttery either. i never have too much of a wait here either - especially with the early check-in program they have.i'm usually in and out with a simple buzz.
"what a mistake! i went in just to get  my long hair trimmed about an inch, and walk out with the shortest haircut i have had in the last 10 years from a stylist named ""elia"".  i just will never understand how asking someone to cut off one inch of dead ends translates to......cut my hair that is almost to the middle of my back  to about my shoulders, and add layers to my hair that was all one length (shortest layer now being to my chin).:( i cant even bring myself to wear it down because it brings me to tears to even look at it."
when you go ask for katie! she is awesome. the reason for my two stars is generally i have good experiences but i don't know if now i will be back because i went in today and showed the person (not katie) who was cutting my hair exactly what i wanted. thought it was going to look nice because i have a wedding to go to this weekend. the person cutting my hair waited until after i was done to tell me that he couldn't get it to look the way i wanted it to. um hello!? why didn't you say anything?!? i showed you exactly what i wanted and you said you could do it and now i have to pay for a hair cut that i hate and doesn't even look the way i wanted it to. definitely left feeling like i got ripped off.
i would like to take a minute to thank this wonderful stylist names elia. i was so proud of my hair looks in front of my family in this thanksgiving dinner. everyone liked my hair cut. and i promise myself to go back there again... feeling excited :)
i went there yesterday and the left side of my hair is three inches longer than the right!!! besides i had a nicethree layer haircut and i asked to trim the ends keeping the same hair cut.. i have like 50 layers all different lenghts and loos like my hair got chopped wih a machee!! never going back!!!!
i go there if luiz is working because my hair is long & i want it to stay that way. he is great hair dresser.
"was working in coppell last week and needed a trim and the folks at great clips were wonderful. very friendly and fast. i stopped in shortly after they opened and was in and out quickly and my haircut was done well, grant it i just do a quick clipper cut, but it was still done well."
"my normal hairstylist at another store wasn't working today. i went back here to get a haircut. i had to ask her to fix several spots on my head and she tried her best. as usual, i had to fix my hair when i got back home."
"probably won't ever come back to this location. kind of a long wait, and whenever people come in, instead of saying something like ""i'll be with you shortly"", they take time from cutting your hair to walk over to the computer. about 5 people walked in while i was there, and my haircut lady decides to walk over to the computer. just didn't seem like the right thing to do. maybe use a sign in sheet or something?other complaint was they didn't allow me to use my online coupon. so a little disappointed there for paying $19 for a marginal experience. i could have used my coupon at sport clips! get the mvp treatment lol.but really though, i don't care about my hair too much, so i am just going to wait around til the next $7.99 sale."
been going to great clips for years in different states.  this place is okay depending on the stylist the good ones are always busy and the bad ones are really bad.  couple times the stylist had to stop and bring another stylist over  to see what to do next.  sorry not interested in being a testing dummy anymore.
"quality of the cut depends upon the stylist, but is generally okay (not great, but not terrible) for the price.  the last time my son and i tried to get a haircut there we went in about 30 minutes before closing.  the chairs were all full, but no one was waiting.  we were told it was too close to closing for them to take us.  i pointed  out that there was no one waiting, they didn't close for 30 minutes, and our haircuts typically take about 15 minutes, max.  no luck.  i guess closing early for the day is more important than taking care of regular customers.  we won't be back, ever."
i just needed a quick trim so i decided to come to my local hair salon to check them out.  i have another friend who has long hair like mine and who just likes to get a few trims thru out the year just to clean it up.  why pay $40 for that!  great clips was perfect for what i needed done.  i was in and out within 30 minutes and i left a happy customer!  i highly recommend this place.
"first time here. kwi was excellent. this place opens at 10am on sundays, which is a huge differentiator from local competition. waits can get long right when doors open so make sure to do online check-in."
nice clean location with online check in. always get a perfect cut with miss kwi..she has been cutting my hair this last year and always does a great job.
today was my second time to have my hair cut here. the first time i had juan. he was great patient and very knowledgeable. the second time i came i had kwi. she was a lot of fun very talkative and easy to get along with. i am fairly simple when i get my haircut take an inch off six players leave as much on my head as possible. both times have come here they have honored my wishes and i have left happy! enough to the point where i purposely came on to you out to leave a great review for them. i'm not sure who the woman at the counter was who answer my phone call but she was very sweet and nice and talk to us as she was also cutting another man's hair. it was like a big party lots of fun. i left being charged only $14 for haircut so i left a pretty decent tip. i definitely will return and recommend this place to others.
"terrible! not only incompetent hairstylists but no concept of customer service and rude managers! bad haircuts followed by refusal to fix a bad job with an attitude that you are just one less customer. maybe this place is fine for kids or men who just want a trimmer run through their head, but certainly not for women or anyone wanting a decent style."
"not accepting gift card bought from another locationbought gift card (5 hair cuts for $55) from lewisville tx and used for 1 hair cut.tried to use at coppell tx location - was told the card is not valid, so paid by credit card.called customer service and was told the card is valid at coppell, tx but had to pay full pricecalled the salon again to check and was told that the card is valid, but still $15.called customer service back and was told it is valid at coppell and they should be charging only $11don't know what is going on with great clips@coppell."
they do a decent job here for my done who is 9. just don't be afraid to speak up and tell them what you like and don't like. juan is the best.
"i have been going here for a little over 4 years now. by now, most of them know me pretty well. they are all very friendly, and in general cut my hair pretty well. the thing i love the most about this place, besides the people who work here, is the fact that they have an online reservation system. that way, i don't really have to go there and wait for too long. let's just say that i like this place so much that even though i don't live in coppell anymore, i always drive to coppell to get my haircut."
"great service. never disappointed. may be a bit pricey than the other locations, but it's worthy of every extra dollar you spend."
"poor customer service.  would rather try mutt works (yes a dog grooming and specialty store) located a few doors down,  than come back here."
"most of the people that come here are regulars, and most have preferred stylists.  i am one of those that found a favorite stylist.  the staff turnover is extremely low, so a great feeling of ""family"" exists when visiting.  everyone is extremely friendly.  another deal that can't be beat for regulars -- you can buy a $50 gift card and get haircuts for $10, a savings of $20 ($4 off per haircut).  it's like getting 1.5 free haircuts!  the online checkin is also a bonus.  yup, there's even an app for it!  i can see what the wait time is and check in before i leave work, often arriving in time to walk right into a chair."
"went back again for another hair cut. got the same stylist, and everything was amazing again. very quick and i got exactly what i wanted: shorter hair. highly recommended. best place i've ever been for haircuts."
please if you are going here do not let anyone cut your hair but enrique. the other workers just flat out don't know how to cut hair and they look at you and say it's just your type of hair or it's a cow lick. you've been warned. if enrique is not there walk away fast before they butcher your hair. managers and owners should be paying attention to what's going own in their businesses. i won't be going back again.
"check in two of my nephews to get a haircut. bethany came up to the counter and called out a donald that was already being assisted then she announced my 4 year old nephews name. once she realized that he was a little kid she made a nasty expression like she didn't want to cut his hair. she took about 3 minutes to ""cut"" his hair. she didn't even bother brushing his hair nor wiped the bit amount of hair she cut off that was all over his face. extremely disappointed in the service, bethany shouldn't be working there if she doesn't know or want to cut hair. we had to leave without my second nephews hair cut because it was such a bad experience. never again going here."
the only person i see here is kate.  why?  she is always sweet and always cuts my hair right.i like this place because it's pretty nice and not old looking like the other gc'sthe only reason they get 4 stars is kate.  so she better not leave.  it took me a while to find her after my last hair girl got pregnant.
"when he started looking like a girl, i took my teenage son here for a haircut and when we left, he had locks that had been missed.  they were one-three inches longer than the other hair next to them!  when he got in the car, he ran his hands through his hair and handfuls of cut hair fell out.  apparently, they didn't comb his hair while or after cutting it. i've never seen such a thing!  it was horrible.  we went right back in to have it redone and they played it off like all haircuts have handfuls of loose cut hair left in them (as a cook, i'd estimate about 1.5 cups of hair).  someone else fixed it, but no one ever apologized or offered anything extra for the trouble."
"sabrina did an amazing job on my hair.  she truthfully gave me one of the best haircuts i've ever had (and trust me, i've had a lot - from both chop shops like great clips and professional salons like t & g).  she kept my layers long, framed my face perfectly, and even showed me all the spots where the last hair dresser messed up.  sabrina also gave me some really good product recommendations for my hair type, and took the time to double-check her work when she was finished to make sure everything turned out perfect.  i will never go to another great clips again so long as sabrina works at this one, and, if she ever leaves, i'm going with her.  no joke.the other woman who cut my husband's hair (i think her name was darlene) did an ok job, but could have done better.  she left it somewhat longer than we wanted, and it looked a bit choppy on the sides.  if sabrina is there tonight, we're probably going to go back and see if she can fix it up a bit.(update - 05/01/15)sabrina is now the only person my husband uses too.  i think it's fair to say that i'm very picky about my hubby's hair, and she does it perfectly every time.  we never go to anyone else."
"i went in to get hair cut and nancy was assigned to me to cut my hair. it hair cut only took 10 minutes. literally. overall experience was never good, i actually thought she never learn how to cut hair.i told her how i wanted my hair to be done and even in the middle of cutting my hair, i gave more instruction. all of them was taken lightly by her. she never took my request seriously and went ahead with her own perspective of my request. she pulled my hair very hard that it hurts my scalp. also, while she's making a conversation with me, she would hit my arm. she tried to be nice and everything but little did she know that she hit me too hard for a friendly gesture.hair cut like this cost me $14 (excluding tips). i can get it for $5 (tips included) in some chinatown. it's not the level of service i expected. very not recommended."
bad experience today. she did not even clean hair on me. i wont give even a single star if there is am option.
"i walked in and eliza greeted me warmly, knew what style would look best, and kept great conversation with me while she did the cutting.  great customer service! i'm definitely coming back."
"i would not recommend this place to be honest. i have gone twice and have had mixed reviews. the first time i went one of the ladies cut my hair and did a pretty nice job (i get a fade and have them go from a 1/2 to a 3 and 1/2, standard guy haircut). it wasn't anything special but she cut my hair right.the last time i went was terrible. i was greeted by a girl who sat me down and asked what i wanted. when i told her, she walked away and a different girl came out and moved me to a different chair (i guess the first girl didn't know how to cut a fade?). i told her what i wanted and she didn't think my hair was long enough for a 3 and 1/2 on top so she ran the clippers through my hair with the bit on it, but did not turn on the clippers. as the clippers yanked out my hair, she figured out that my hair was more than long enough. after cutting my hair the first time, i found that there were several spots that were very uneven and it looked patchy. she said she noticed it but didn't do anything about it until i saw it (did she just want to see if she could get away with me not noticing?). she cleaned it up a bit more and when she was done the haircut looked ok at best. i used to cut my hair on a regular basis and what she did was at the level of what i could have done on my own. i go to a place to get a great cut, not just something that i could do at home.i would not recommend this place. after 2 times there i won't be going back for a 3rd. good thing hair grows back and i can get this redone somewhere else afterwards."
"$14 a cut?! great for ppl on a budget, like me, and i have been to other locations and have had great stylists every time."
kate is a great stylist been seeing her for over a year now. i have been in on days she has been off gotten a cut and regretted it. giving this place 4 stars and they are all for her....
"a decent haircut... will work for me.  i'm not very picky.  problem i have is the price.  this is going to sound odd... but i've never tipped people to give a haircut.  it doesn't make any sense to me.  charge the fee that you want to charge, and don't expect more than that.  restaurants should do the same, but especially hair salons.  great clips charges $14 for a guy's haircut (mind you, that's without a shampoo before hand, which i got for $16 in georgia).  but i'm not complaining about the haircut.  so if they would have charged me $20, i would have paid it (that would have been $5 cheaper than other salons in the area), and it would have given the stylist $6 extra dollars and he wouldn't have to worry about people giving tips. probably won't go back, as i'm not a fan of strip-mall salons like this.  i'm used to a more homely atmosphere, not so professional... warmer.  (since i'm from georgia... southern, if you like. )"
"the stylist that was doing my 4 year old daughters hair quit working at great clips. went back to have it done by someone else and they completely messed it up. i had to ask another stylist to make it better and she  helped it a little. now we will be waiting about a month for a bad inverted-bob haircut to grow out, then go somewhere else to get it fixed."
"just went in today and got my kids hair cut. fantastic service. the ladies did an amazing job on their hair. my kids are extremely happy. also, super quick service. we were a walk in and were helped immediately by the staff. they are extremely sweet. i will definitely bring my family back to this location. the lady named tina cut my son's hair and a lady named maggie cut my daughters. amazing jobs ladies."
new rowlett location off dalrock...went there with a style in mind showed it to the guy and it went down hill from there. did not realize how bad it was till i went home to blow dry it. i called up there and was told i could see maggie and she. would fix it. i went up there today to get it fixed to walk into the location to hear the original guy that cut my hair talking trash about me. i was super pissed and just walked out went some where else to get my hair  fixed. but because he took so much off i still could not get the style i was originally going for.
"just wasted 30 min of my time! i just wanted a shampoo, blow out, and straightened was told $30 by one girl( very friendly). then when it was my turn the lady who was going to do my hair said it was more like $45. so now my hair isn't done and i am super annoyed!"
"7/23/17 to great clips corp. please consider removing the online check in tool, it's diluting the great clips brand. i have had many situations where the posted online wait times are extremely understated upon arrival and i'm afraid this is becoming the norm. very frustrating."
"the store is okay. never go to crystal she has no idea what she is doing. she can't read the notes previous stylists use. she screwed up my hair. she us d the machine where it's clearly said to use the ""scissors"". i look like i just had a head surgery. she was in a rush to get me out of these. didn't even blow the hair properly just wiped my neck and let me out. i have been going to this location for more than a year. everyone i dealt with were experienced and knew how to read."
"had haircut here for a long time. regular stylist left, tried a new stylist here.  she used an unclean pair of clippers that gave me a scalp infection.  tried to contact the owner and they never called me back."
"i've only been here once and i'm never returning. yes i was greeted warmly and helped promptly but those were the only good things. none of the stylists there were either cleaning or sterilizing their equipment. that's how infections and parasites get passed.and the lady that did cut my hair went way too fast, as well as put in a fade after i specifically asked to not get one. and she left the right side of my hair an inch longer than the other. overall, avoid going here at all."
i checked in online and went in with no waiting. my stylist today was khammy. she did an excellent job; very detail oriented.
"within about 10 seconds of walking in, someone got my name down and told me i'd be taken care of as soon as they could get to me. i literally walked over to the chair, sat down, and sat for about 10 seconds before brandon let me know he was just cleaning his station for me. he cleaned it up quickly and got my name and after that he actually made the effort to call me by it. he made double sure i was ready for the haircut (i've been growing it out 5 years and asked for a shorter inverted bob) before cutting my hair. now, folks, i have a lot of hair. he probably cut about 8 to 10 inches off in most places, and my hair is crazy thick. he got my hair cut the exact way i wanted it and did it in about 30 minutes. not bad. not bad at all. plus he never complained about how long or thick my hair was. he made a comment that i had a lot of hair, but never once did he complain or act rude to me, even when telling me about the screaming kids before me he wasn't dogging on them, he just told me the story and didn't talk bad about the family at all. when i went to leave he said, ""see you in about 8 weeks!"" i will definitely be back for a haircut here. i've never gotten such a great experience from a generic hair place. brandon definitely made it worth the short trip over there!"
"you just created a loyal customer! i walked in here with no appointment (because no appointment is required) and got seen within 10 minutes. my stylist asked me questions that i've never been asked before. at first i was a little perplexed as to why i was being asked so many questions, but then i realized that the stylists are systematically trained to deliver the perfect haircut each time. i've been to expensive hair stylists before, and the cut that they delivered is right on par (and even better) than most. it was executed so quickly, too. my stylist recommended some hair strengthening products to address my concerns of thinning hair. the cost for a hair cut is something like $15, which is a great deal. the best part about this is that they have a system that takes visual notes on your haircut so that every time you come back (to any location in the world), they can deliver the perfect haircut to you. man. i'm surprised i have not heard about you all sooner. this is great!"
"have been going to this location for a few years and have always been pleased for the most part.  today was horrible.  the stylist that cut my hair hurried through the haircut asking no questions about what i wanted, etc.  the hair is cut way up over one ear and the other is down and uneven.  sideburns are just as bad.  there are long hairs everywhere.  she cut way up on the sides and back in the temple.  didn't even ask about the neckline.  it is so bad it is too bad to go out in public!  i don't think she cared and certainly didn't act like she wanted to be there.  horrible stylist!!!  the salon is ok but i will wait an hour before i'll let her cut my hair again."
"my 2 year old daughter wiggles like crazy when i try to cut her hair.  i totally messed it up, but gigi fixed it for us!  she did a great job and was very patient when samantha tried to move from the scissors.  i asked adela to trim up my neck while i was there, and she ended up giving me a great haircut!  we had coupons for a haircut for $5.99, so for $11.98 plus tip, my daughter and i look great.  we will be back!!"
"my husband and son get their haircuts here and they alway do a great job. and, i'm a picky wife and mom about my guy's appearance. they keep a record of the type of haircut that they get, so it's easy for them to walk in and always get a consistent haircut. also, my husband loves the online check in app. it's so helpful because they walk in and are seated in a timely manner."
cheapest place around - there are lots of choices - and quality is ok.  little concerned about the cleanliness - you never see anyone clean their scissors between customers.
"i'm standing in front of the great clips at 9:03 and there is no one inside - what's the point of store hours if you don't honor them? i'm guessing a staff member overslept but the manager/owner has to be all over that. hope to hear from the owner and get an apology.update: someone came at 9:10 and told me to be system was down so they couldn't cut my hair. if they knew it was down when they closed, the least you can do is put a note on the door or something."
"this ls the worst place, they do not care about online appointments at all, the staff is rude and careless"
i have been here few times and found out that hair stylist don't cut hair as instructed. i am planning to change the salon.
my 88 year old mom got a great haircut from sue. she cut my mom's hair just like we asked. we love it. sue was so very kind to her.  we waited less than 10 minutes. next time we will use their app and check in on line.
"owner commented below my review,  he put his spin on what happened,   i have used the online check in system many times before with no problem.   it could have  been faulty the morning this situation happened. i don't know, but  i checked at the right right location and arrived within the time the online system alerted me to be there.   it looks like as i read the reviews, much time is spent disputing the reviews.  it seems the reviews tell the real story,  my review stands.  i was treated horrible by the manager, screamed at by this person and was treated in a very poor manner showing no respect what so ever no matter the situation.  owner commented that its a busy salon, should be with a huge population/economic growth in this area, but as always what goes around comes around, good luck, it will be needed. my original review stands:place a total disaster.  manager screamed at me because when he did not see my name on list of people that check in online.  i checked in online at the right location on time and arrived on time.   rude  rude rude rude,  call 800 number for great clips,   owner did contact me with a less than sincere apology, but spent more time attempting to justify manager's actions and attitude and trying to put all the blame on me the customer.  .      no way,  beware.."
i love virginia !! she does a great job all the time since i sat in her chair 4 yrs ago i am always satified and she is always listening  to my crazy stories and takes her time to inform me about products !!
worst cutting i have done before. i never visit this place again i recommend don't cut your hair
"i was a walk-in, first time customer and they were able to help me almost immediately. the lady that did my hair - carmen - was very professional and friendly. i'm pretty picky with my hair and usually think stylists cut too much of my hair off when i ask for a quarter inch trim, but she did an excellent job. will definitely be going back!"
"this place is really helpful if you are working on how to improve your patience!you go there and think, aah there is one guy ahead, ok i am after him. then all of a sudden the vips show up with electronic ""check-in"" and you fall back in line. i think they should have one numbering system running sequentially for both electronic or personal check-in and just call the number to avoid all this silliness. it's hair-cutting for god's sake; it won't be long before someone creates an app to check-in for toilets, just to let the vips know which urinals/stalls are empty.i've found a better and cheaper place, so my patience is still a work in progress."
"place was clean, but neither employees there today spoke english very well at all, which i suppose is fine... but it is a bit difficult to describe the haircut you want if you don't speak the same language.when i was leaving, i signed the receipt and handed it to her and she just took it without even looking at me and just called the next person up. which again, no big deal, but it was pretty impersonal.the haircut was average, it does not look bad at all, but it was overall not the most pleasant experience."
"this is the place where i usually go for a hair cut. its clean inside but not enough parking spaces outside. all the employees are friendly i would say, not all of them are good at english but they are good at doing their job. this young guy at the desk, i think his name is edward, is kind of rude. other than that this place gets your job done. don't forget to check-in online before you go there so that you don't have to wait when you reach there."
worst service in this place..no point in checking in online . the guys who cuts the hair just screams at you when asked where you stand in the queue ..horrible customer service..i have been to many great clips locations but never ever coming to this place..he says u can just walk away ..how rude is that!!!horrible horrible horrible!!!
"i was very surprised to see that this location had a 3 star. i have always had a great experience at this location. it is definitely busy, so you need to prepare. i always check in on-line to make sure i have a spot, but once i enter the staff is always very friendly. i am in and out in no time. i will continue to go back over and over again!"
"the employees in this facility do a super hasty job and they don't spend more than 7-8 minutes per customer. i was afraid if the stylist would hurt my ears. i've experienced a similar situation at the same facility earlier and thought it was an issue with only that particular stylist. with this time, i decided that all employees working at this facility do a similar job."
"""if the stylist won't take the time to do their own hair very well, imagine what they are going to do to you!""6.99 special mistake!"
they do a good job but they should designate parking spaces for their store. only 2 people inside getting a haircut and 0 parking available.
"upon entering great clips in irving it was clear that cutting kids hair was clearly not welcomed business by the male manager of the store. whereas as most adept managers would welcome 4 clients with a smile, especially considering the hair salon was empty and they have the possibility of repeat business, instead we were greeted by the man with a grimace as he sat... and sat.. and sat. he had no appointment waiting and when prompted to help with the others childrens' hair he remained in repose. in contrast, the female stylist helen was pleasant cordial, and great with kids. since we were  told that the male stylist/manager would cut the girls hair along with helen we were surprised when helen was left with four kids hairs to cut as he twiddled his thumbs.. let me be clear he is infact a hair dresser. later he quasi pretended to count the money in his drawer. when another stylist arrived she said she could not cut the baby's hair as she had a belly ache. and asked helen to do it as well. at this point i commented that it was not right to come into a salon and two very able employees just refuse to actually do their job. the man, who admitted he was the manager, let us know that he was the manager and he could essentially do what he wanted.. just to be very clear the  children were  behaved the entire time.it was a terrible experience and no matter how convenient it seems and how lucky they are as far as a fortunate location the manager does not deserve the business of moms and dads who want to have their kids leaving with a nice experience from a hair salon.. albeit, helen was the exception."
"the wait was incredible. only two employees were working and they sent the third one home. someone who i assume was the owner was standing there staring at the employees and customers. he was also taking our pictures. for what, i don't know. i had to leave and went to sport clips and even got a discount for the problem here."
i just moved to irving from denton where i was a regular of great clips on teasley lane for six years. since i have received great cuts there i decided to look for a great clips in irving. nidia of great clips on mcarthur blvd. was very attentive to listening to me explain about how i liked my hair cut. she also offered a few ideas in helping me grow out my hair while keeping it well groomed in the process. who says you have to spend a fortune to get a great cut?
this place is great! the staff are very knowledgable and experienced -- they cut quickly and efficiently. the price is great as well. i highly recommend this location!
horrible!!! i brought my daughter here to get a simple cut and on walking out realized her hair was uneven we walked back in and i told the lady and she cut more of her hair to make it even... we left and after her shower we realized it was was worse that i thought... i will never go back here again
"absolutely awful place. i would give this place 0 stars if i could. my boyfriend went in and showed the man a picture of what he wanted. not only was it not even remotely close to what he asked for (he pretty much shaved his entire head), but he cut into his beard and left a bald spot in his beard. these people have no idea what they are doing and we walked out of there with a free ""haircut"". dismal and disappointing. stay away from here. literally, run."
i visit this location monthly. i've only had great interactions with the staff. they are efficient and friendly. the prices have gone slightly up but i'm sure that's a company thing and not just this location. usually in an out in 30 minutes. the only negative i can point out is parking up front. it's a busy side and if you go around peak time you will have to really look for a spot.
"i have been going here for the past 3 years. the service really depends on your stylist. so far from my experience, the blondes (two of them) and one black lady were very professional, friendly, take their time to do the job, pay attention to details etc. very good experience through them. but there are few asians working there, definitely stay away from holly, she is very rude, not courteous at all, unfriendly and just after the tip as she races to get it done for more head counts. i had multiple bad experiences through her and she was consistently rude and unprofessional.  i wouldn't recommend her at all. couple other asian ladies working there are friendly and did an ok job but if you really want to get it done the right way, please stick with the non asians."
i was really nervous about getting my hair cut by someone other than my normal stylist but brianna couldn't have been better! i needed my hair to be trimmed and evened out (the left side was shorter due to my trichotillamania) but didn't want to lose my length. brianna was really friendly and talked me through how she was going to cut it and it turned out awesome. my hair is the perfect length and the cheap price can't be beat.
"diana cleaned up my sons hair so nice. she does a wonderful job. the staff were so friendly brianna made me feel extra welcome. the facility was nice and clean. i am defiantly coming back, and recommend you bring your whole family. they know how to take care of you!"
"my partner went here and loved it.  and if he is happy, i am happy. the 2 ladies working that night were super friendly and helpful.  it seems as though they weren't in a speed race or anything  like most of the big chain places.  he is really picky about his hair and liked the service.  he will be going here from now on.  good thing it is right beside the mall for me. lol"
"my husband and children have been coming here for years. my husband works close and takes iunch breaks to get his cuts. he is actually really picky about his hair but needs somewhere he can drop in on a dime when he is free. plus, my hair stylist charges about double for a cut.there are a few good stylists here. kim is the best, she takes her time. james  and vicki are good as well. we love the check-in app! they are quick and very nice to my children, they love coming to get haircuts. we actually live in rowlett and come here instead of the rowlett one because they are so much better. the value and cut is great. look for coupons, they come about 4-5 times a year. usually around holidays or special occasions."
used to come here until tonight when i found out they dont take a discount card for people at firewheel. super cuts it is for on now.
"a good haircut is as good as the experience. it's not about how many you can churn through in an hour, but the relationship each stylist has with their client. with this said, my wife goes to aveda, and full disclosure, i could do the same, but that's not me. holly at great clips firewheel is the reason i spend my money at this location. and i realize that by dropping my favorite stylist's name may make my ability to see her a little less easy, i strongly feel she deserves the recognition. if the franchise owner is reading this, please know you have an amazing stylist that has the ability to make lasting connections, and keep clients coming back."
always a decent cut. for around $12. son like the cuts here so i get mine here too. the app sign in is awesome! you can look to see what the wait is and sign in. most of the time i walk in and they are calling my name.
"if we could give ""zero"" stars we would. do not go to dennis. it is a bit difficult to find someone who speaks english here, and dennis does not speak or understand english. my son clearly explained what he wanted and even showed him a picture - leaving his hair longer on top. dennis did not listen at all (or just did not understand english). he completely shaved his head all the way around, the same length, the same blade, and just shaved it all off.  this is for his senior prom!! there are places all around here that i would pick before i would ever go back to this place. beware!!"
"so iim not a local, but i needed to get a haircut in a pinch.the asian lady (vietnamese) was very friendly and cut my hair with concentration and took a bit longer than most folks, but this was probably the best haircut i've had in a while. not sure if it's because i'm also asian, so she 'knows' my hair texture and such, but she was really good a blending my hair and texturizing the top. if i lived here locally, i'd definitely make her my long term hair cutter person... stylist?"
"friendly,small 3 salon pros 11 am sat.  yeah it did the trick in a pinch."
"would never visit this place...   called on the phone to get information (because i am new to the area) and was talked to very rudely by the guy that answered the phone.  if that it the kind of customer service they have, i definitely do not want them cutting my hair."
"when this location opened up, it was awesome as we were happy with the great clips off lover's in dallas back when we lived in that area. the first visit was great, husband & son got their haircuts & came out satisfied.after their first visit, i decided to give 'em a try as i'm rather low maintenance. just needed a thinning out & 2 inches off. when it was my turn, i got a guy who probably did haircuts in the army. i quickly remembered that i wasn't asking for much so i'd go with the flow. when i left, my hair looked fine and i was just happy to get so much weight off my head (i have outrageously thick hair, hence the need for a thinning).i get home, shower and realize that one side is longer than the other side of my head. the next day i go back and explain the situation. they tried to fix it, but to absolutely even it out, i'd have to get a shorter 'do and i really didn't want it shorter than what i had already gotten. they gave me a coupon for a $3.99 haircut for when it grew out a bit more, they'd be able to fix it. yay for uneven hair for two months!i've always said, 'you get what you pay for', so i really didn't feel the need to complain and poo-poo this great clips location until i took my son. he's four. he's traumatized by haircuts ever since his 2nd haircut when he was 10 months old. the hairstylist was rough and it was just downhill from there for him & haircuts.my son got his umpteenth haircut at this location because the staff is actually nice. i trusted they would be kinder, and i'm sure they would have been if we didn't show up at 8:40pm one night.i knew that it was 20 minutes before closing, and like myself, they have things to take care of outside of work. i totally understand that. i was planning on giving a good tip just for the mere fact that we showed up around closing time. i remember being a waitress and people would come to the restaurant 10 minutes before we closed... it was a turn off, but worth the effort since they always left a great tip. i was paying it forward, in my mind.we come in and i could immediately tell the ladies were ready to call it a day. their attitudes couldn't have made that fact clearer. i figured if i kept a positive attitude, things would lighten up.the didn't. the lady that cut my son's hair was harsh. she was purely angry at the fact that we showed up at 8:40pm. i'm sorry, but you close at 9pm. not 8:40pm. she was twisting my son's head back and forth, not even using the clippers carefully, and he was on the verge of tears. i mean, this lady was in a hurry to get out of there.fortunately, my son only needed a trim, so the traumatic experience was over in 10 minutes, and all those 10 minutes were spent on me giving her the crazy eye. i would've grabbed my son, given her the finger and left... but i didn't want my son to have crazy hair. i just let her do her thing, all while comforting and telling him it would be okay. but i made a mental note to immediately write an angry email to great clips.we paid, and we didn't tip.my husband emailed great clips, and within the week we recieved an apologetic phone call and a gift card for 3 haircuts. needless to say, we used the gift card at the great clips off lavon(which, btw is waaaay better). we haven't stepped foot into this location since that fiasco.point of story? don't go in at 8:40pm, because apparently that's when they close."
"obviously, i don't need a stylist or barber.  i've been shaving my head for five years.  however, i have a 13 year old kid with hair that grows like mint, so i'm still forced to visit random hair joints when he starts to look too mark twain-ish.great clips is 1) fast, 2) cheap, 3) filled with stylists that speak understandable english.my needs aren't vast and my expectations are low."
"i moved to this area looking for a great clips i've used them in the past and was going to continue to use them, at the location it said no wait! on the door i waited 15 min, once i got in told the girl how i wanted my hair cut and was told no i can't cut it that way because i might cut my fingers (point cut). i the long run hair turned out ok but felt harassed for address and info and probably to drive a bit to go to a sport cuts."
"i was visiting dallas and was out and about and decided on needed,a haircut. christy took good care of me. the place was clean, nothing or no one smelled bad as other reviews suggest. i am happy with my haircut and if i lived in dallas, i'd probably come back."
total rip off. she barely did anything. so uneven that using clippers at home would be better. meanwhile the competent stylist was doing fine at the chair across the room. avoid this location and go to the other one nearby. this attempt at saving time has created more work to fix it.
"we normally go to the great clips in casa linda. went here because the wait was 60 mins there, but this one had no wait.now i know why. rude and impatient staff. had to go to another expensive salon to fix the damage. do not go to this location"
i wish i could show you how horrible my hair looks. everyday i get sad when i look in the mirror
i have been getting haircuts from great clips for many years. i have to say this is by far the worst one. i would recommend whoever that's reading this to not come to this location.
why would i need to give you my phone number and email address for a haircut? maybe you're confused about how this works.... i have money.... you have haircuts... i give you money... you give me a haircut. that's all. we're not buddies. you don't need anything from me but my money. thanks anyway.
"i would have gave them no star if that was an option. my husband got a haircut with covi last night & came home & it looks like a 4 year old gave a hair cut. she didn't cut the front enough & messed up the back so bad, i have no idea how she has a license to cut hair. i'm so disappointed & taking my complaint to cooperate. this is unacceptable!"
"normally use the location near my home (casa linda).  used this one since it was near my office.  at 57 years of age, i have had a lot of haircuts.  hands down- this was the worst cut i have ever had.  i have an appt to get it corrected, as much as can be done, this weekend- not at great clips.  clearly there is a total lack of quality control standards between locations so i am scratching great clips off my list as a whole.  one bad franchise location can give the whole brand a very bad reputation.  great clips needs to check on this particular store location."
this is what i get for trying to save a buck. worst haircut of my life. i am literally going home to shave my head now. i am so so so so mad!!!!!
"devanny was amazing she took the time to see what i wanted, and gave a great cut. wait time was minimal, will come back."
"i've been here several times and it's rare to remember the times i had a good experience getting a simple haircut. i always keep ""trying""and hoping i would get someone good. all i need is a simple haircut and for whatever reason they can't deliver it.  i just can't come here anymore - it's very convenient since i live nearby but it's tough; i will try somewhere else.guys... avoid going late in the evening. the good stylists work at normal hours - the bad ones work more until they close (especially on weekdays). avoid them!!!"
"met a nice lady in the am shift today. i like my hurcut. haha i was laughing out the door, she's really nice. :)"
terrible. uneven cut. a patch of long hair in the back. didn't even take a minute to wipe hairs off the back of my neck. woman even smells bad.
"kid haters (or racist)  at this salon. i went in tonight and waited in line behind a hispanic dad with his three sons. the dad asked the stylist to even out his child's sideburns, which the stylist did. i saw the dad tip the stylist ten dollars then leave. i was then called over to the chair. i reluctantly sat down in a chair that was above piles of cut hair underneath. as soon as the clippers hit my head, the stylist opened her mouth to say how much she hated cutting the hair of the kid before me. she said the dad always calls her attention to the ""stupid sideburns.""  the other stylist defended the father and proceeded to clean her area waiting for the next patron.  someone entered and sat in the other stylist's chair. i overheard her ask the gentleman if he was new to the area and if he had kids. he said no and she said good because he did not want his kids in disd. i spoke up at that point and asked what that comment was about. she said that several of her customers are teachers and that they all say the kids are bad because the parents do not parent their children. she went on an on about how bad the parents must be. i suggest that all parents in the area take their kids for haircuts elsewhere since the stylist at this salon apparently dislike the parents correcting a bad haircut and the stylist must believe that the kids in disd are all bad since they spoke of such with conviction. oh and my haircut - terrible!"
"went in for a trim, and just a little bit of layers. what can i say? you get what you pay for. when i got home, i washed my hair and straightened it. yeah.... it was uneven. i had about five inches trimmed off, and there was a little part that was still not cut off. some parts were uneven so i had to cut it myself. i can always curl it or style it some other way to show less of the uneven. i hate getting my hair cut. it's a yearly thing or when i get a lot of split ends. i've paid more and had the same experience, which is why two stars and not one. i'm just glad that hair grows back."
going to great clips is like rolling the  dice. you never know what your going to get. i can tell you exactly what you can get at this location bad service! bad hair cut! unless you want extensions then you might be fine
this is the worst haircut experience i've ever had in the 27 years of my life. i got a haircut here yesterday and these people razor burned the entire back of my neck when straightening it up. the entire back of my neck has burned ever since and i could barely sleep with how painful it was and still is.i would not recommend this place to anyone.
"i had an absolutely horrible experience here. if ever you have to get your hair cut here, please, please avoid the short black lady. i was screaming inside while she was doing my hair. it took her no more than 5 minutes(not an exaggeration) to do my hair. neither one of her short arms could reach the top half of my head, and she didn't even try to put effort into cutting my hair on both sides. to be honest, a chimpanze can probably do a better job with a couple minutes of training. this is seriously the worst hair cut experience i've ever had."
"i once again had a great experience at this great clips in richardson. be sure to request lisa she is awesome!! very professional, timely, and sweet! lisa always remembers the style i prefer and i'm picky. the staff keeps the place clean and is always so courteous. do yourself a favor ask for lisa and enjoy a fantastic haircut experience!!"
"went in sunday with 5 people to get hair cuts, 3 where great 2 not so much.  the woman i had could not understand what i was telling her and i did not get what i wanted. my daughters hair was not done as i wanted, was told it would look like a boy hair cut, but since she had cut her hair by her self ( the 4 year old ) she needed the shorter cut to even it out so i paid for her to get a trim ( waste of my money).  the three boys where perfect."
absolutely awful!!! i have tried this place 3x. they must be hiring the stylists at the bottom of their class. i asked for a low fade and even pointed out where i wanted the line to be. she shaved the side of my head. i asked her to stop and got up and left
walked in yesterday after going to sweet & sassy at firewheel and getting declined for not having an appointment. had a great experience! thank you for my son's first fabulous hair cut! major looks so handsome! thank you pretty lady with those awesome green nails!!
"we've taken our toddler there several times and always had a good experience, until our last visit.a lady named kiwi or kiri, not sure, cut his hair. she didn't have much patience like the other ladies have had and left our little boys hair so short and uneven that i have no choice but to wait until it grows to try and fix it. just terrible. at that my little guy does very well when getting a haircut he doesn't move a whole lot and cooperates more than the average toddler would. very disappointed. i usually don't write negative reviews but i can't help but regret going into this salon the day we did."
"i informed the person i wanted a trim. bethany, decided to start cutting without clarifying. i felt like a big chunk was taken off and i asked how much  are you taking off? she replied two inches and i asked what, i said a trim. she said that is a standard trim.  far from a trim!!! every other trim i have had is defined by a half inch to and inch. and then she proceeds to tell me it makes your hair grow faster. lie. trimming your hair has nothing to do with the follicles at my scalp. trimming helps it make healthier as it grows. ridiculous. reminds me why i haven't got my hair trimmed by incompetent people at great clips in years but with the time crunch of getting to a wedding i could sneak by with a trim. apparently not!!  i would give zero stars if i could. bethany - next time ask what the definition of a trim is to your customer before you start cutting."
"i went to trim my nack hair into straight line. the stylist, kiwi hiwi, said she need to see my neck so she open the cape??!! the hair was not even long enough to touch the cape yet!! so all the hair fell onto and inside my clothes!!!! i told her kindly that no one does that. she didn't listen. after she said she was done trimming, my hair was still not in a straight line!! i found untrimmed hair like 5 times and told her to trim it. this is the worst experience i have ever had! she felt no shame and charged me full price!"
i like to have haircut at this place. it's a good place with affordable price.
"there is about a 50% chance you will get a great clip here... ive been here 4 times and there has been completely different staff every time i come here. i was here last wednesday,  went in and was told they are only taking cash. i went and got cash, came back and there were 3 people that had just arrived.. one dirty homeless looking guy. the lady i just talked to ( tattoo titties hanging out giant giant hair) put me at the end of the line..i told her i had already been there and just went to get cash.. well she still put me at the end, now i have to wait even longer and go after the nasty guy! no thanksi don't know who manages this place.. but this day in age to not have your credit/debit fixed by 3pm  is just sloppy"
"i've come here a few times now, and they've become my go-to for a good haircut! i've never had a long wait (i always come after work on a weeknight), they keep track of how i like my hair done, and they always do a pretty good job."
"i went here last thursday and it was almost completely empty only one customer and about three workers as soon as we walked in the lady (katherine) asked for our number and since my mom doesn't  know english she said ""huh"" and she yelled ""your number"" ok well that doesn't really matter i kinda just ignored her i went inside to get a haircut and i told the lady ( with purple hair african american )i want about 6 inches cut off and i showed her with my hands about how much i want to be cut off  then she took me to the back and she wet my hair after we came back from wetting my hair she asked me 4 inches right? and i said yes assuming  she knows what she's talking about so she started cutting my hair and i don't even think she tried to communicate with me once instead of her saying ""you have a lot of hair child"" but that's fine so she cut my hair and she cut my bangs the right way ( thank god ) and when she was done she gave me a mirror as soon as she gave me the mirror i had realized she had cut my hair at least about 10 inches instead of "" 4 inches"" according to her but you know what at the end of the day i liked my hair even though it was way shorter then i had thought and i don't recommend this place if you are extremely picky about your hair"
"i am so disappointed in the way this store treats customers. i took my son tonight for a back to school haircut, and took my two year old daughter with me. we stood by watching my son, taking picture to commemorate this occassion. my daughter stood close to me quietly singing or dancing while we waited. three fourths of the way through the stylist gets a call from her boss. apparently the boss drove by and saw my daughter. she told her employee to tell me to ""keep my child seated in a chair and get her under control"" i can not believe the audactity of this store manager to dictate to a parent, when they can not even see or interact in person to correctly assess the situation.i will never return, and i will be quite vocal on how poorly i was treated."
great service!!! fast and friendly staff and i love the clean environment!! all the lady there are nice and the price are awesome!!! it's so convenient for me. this location is right by my house!!!! all the stylists are so helpful when i needed to purchase products!!! i just love everything about this salon!!
"in my quest for the perfect cheap barber in dallas, i've found good & cheap here, but still finding barbers who ask you what you want, and then cut your hair the way the want.the good:  quick service, good basic haircut, facility is clean, inexpensive. stylist was nice. the not so good: i asked that my hair be left the same length in the back, this was basically ignored. hair grows back so no big deal. if you want an inexpensive, good, quick, no frills cut, this is the place."
almost never busy and the haircuts are reasonably priced. i've never had a bad experience here.
"this place can be great, it depends on who you get. i've had good experiences with everyone there except katherin. i think shes the oldest one there. i've been nice about it and let her cut my hair more times than i should hoping she knows what shes doing but i've come to realized either she just doesn't know how to cut hair or shes super sloppy/lazy at it. she really screwed it up this time. if the place wasn't so close and i didn't have a $50 haircut card (which only works at the one you bought it at), than i'd go somewhere else. katherin is also not great at taking criticism or following any kind of directions, she seems like a nice person, but she just doesn't know how to cut hair or wants to be done so she cuts corners (pun intended). when i came home and rinsed and dried my hair i noticed it was uneven with parts of it sticking out all over, i probably would've noticed earlier but she likes to rush you out the door so she can get back to sitting.from now on i'll be sure not to let her cut my hair.  if it wasn't for her i'd give this place at least 4 stars."
"terrible,terrible,terrible!  will never go back.  cut my hair and didnt even blow dry the hair off of me.  just removed smock and said you are good."
"i would not recommend this place to anybody . these people don't have any idea how to cut hair , they did a really bad job to my kids . i ll never come back again. no more that one star is worth!!"
great haircuts and great service!! everyone is very knowledgeable on products and haircuts!!
"i seriously don't think anyone here truly knows how to cut hair, my boyfriend and i went in today to get our hair cut. i asked for my split ends to be cut high so they don't grow back, i asked for 3 inches off. i got maybe a half inch trim and still have split ends when i left. they didn't do my boyfriends hair at all like he asked, they practically made him bald around his ears and didn't blend the hair on his neck at all, it looks like half bald to long hair. unless you just want a shitty little haircut that you have to pay 15 dollars for, i'd say go somewhere else."
"great consistent experience with chad. i had my hair cut here by other stylists too and no problems at all.just wish there was an online schedule, so that once you get to know a stylist you can just schedule online or on the app instead of having to call in."
"i had a fantastic experience at this great clips! let me start by saying, i have been going to a stylist in uptown for 3 years who i still really like, but i can't bring myself to pay $80 (with tip) for a hair cut! i also live in northwest dallas now, so needed something closer.i was desperate for a cut and found this location via yelp with good reviews so decided to check it out. i was very nervous and anxious but i had to try! i went on a sunday afternoon and got right in, my stylist was phal (if i remember correctly). she listened attentively to what i wanted and it turned out great! i have naturally curly hair, but soft curls, not super tight curls. if it is cut bad, it's hard to cover up. i have a bob style and just needed a trim and she nailed it. $24 included my wash and cut with tip! hard to beat and i will definitely be going back. i feel like great clips can get a bad wrap from time to time, but if you have been on the fence about a cheap haircut, give this place a try!"
"doesn't deserve a star at all. won't ever come back to this location. i checked in online since the normal location i go to was busy. i went in, they said ""welcome to go great clips"". so since everyone was busy and no one came to the counter, i sat down and waited (my name already on the list). a gentleman walks in, gets taken back immediately. then a lady comes back to the counter and asks if i'm getting a cut and i told her yes i checked in online. she responded, quite rudely, that next time i need to let someone know and not just sit here. to which i stated that when i came in, no one came to the counter so i sat down to wait. she then takes me back. i'm only getting a trim. she makes me stand during my haircut (b/c she states my hair is over the chair) which i have never had to do for any reason!! then she doesn't even let my hair properly. she just pulls it all to be back and cuts it straight across and says ok you're done! i've had plenty of haircuts and nothing like that! i had to tell her to trim the front part of my hair too. to which her response was, oh you want me to cut that too? uh, yes dear, last time i checked it was part of my hair and i came in for a hair trim. i will be going back to my regular location for them to fix the mess this woman made. how can anyone make a trim look horrible??"
"i wish there was a zero star. 1. for the price- hair styling and blow dry is extra $25 versus fantastic sams and super cuts charge only additional 5-10 dollars max. 2. hair cut was worse. shape of hair is uneven both sides, inspire of me pointing out to the guy who did his haircut. another member had a similar experience. the guy who cut his hair has sweaty smelly hands... overall a nasty place with zero stars...avoid this place if possible.."
"went in early on a friday and got my haircut by a complete stranger! julius took my ratchet outgrown pixie cut (i've been calling it my mullet if that helps you get the picture) and turned it into an adorable bob! i didn't show him any pictures, i just said make it look better and he did! amazing haircut in less than 30 mins for half of what i would normally pay!"
"jazmine is amazing the only one in dallas that has been able to ""cut into"" the front of my hair symetrically.make sure to schedule an appointment she only works 2 days a week."
"jeanne the manager is a doll!  she has turned around this location and it shows.  with the great attitude of the staff and the quality of the cuts - you have to do a double take...""i'm at great clips??""  what!?  they remember your name and treat you like a vip.  this is where i'll be going from now on.  kudos to jeanne and her team."
"maybe it was just this location but the haircut was below average and the lady who cut my hair had zero interest in being friendly. i asked her the standard haircut questions, how is your day, how long have you been cutting hair, are you from the area. answers: fine, 30 years, yes. i felt i was an inconvenience to her day. i will never go back here."
i am loving my haircut from great clips!! almost everytime i have tried to get layers in my hair the stylist has never cut it right.  this time however they got it so right!!i had my hair cut by jeanne and she did an amazing job!  i will definetly be back in the future!!! thank you jeanne!!
"quick , efficient service. i went with jeanne. she is very polite , friendly , great customer service. she said hi to everyone who walked in. gave me a nice haircut, did not push me to buy products. would definitely come again. $20 with tip , who can beat that?"
i got my cut from diane. she is really good and understands what you want. i would definitely be coming back.
"solid $14 haircut, i've been looking for a local bargain place to get a stylish haircut for men. i definitely found it here this place is super updated on the inside and staff is pretty knowledgable of what they're doing. i got my cut with darlene i believe, needless to say i was content with my haircut i will be back."
"many people look down on chain places like this. you tell them what you want or if you want it the same as last time they save it. i love the online check in on the app. they always do a good job for a fair price for me and always take time and care with my hair focusing on the details. i love this place and have been using this franchise for a while, but this location is always above and well beyond others. good stylists and kept running this well by excellent management probably goes up to the owner. this will now be my only location i visit. they take care of me well. thank you. please stay around with superb service for a long, long time."
"having shoulder surgery and not able to use my right arm i have been getting my long hair washed and flat ironed.  today, being in a hurry and not able to get to the salon i typically have been going to , i made the mistake of choosing great clips in addison,texas.  i checked in  when i left my house and my wait at that time was 15 minutes. but, when i got to the salon i waited an additional 30 minutes before being served. then,  incompetent stylist, an older hispanic woman, soaked my back while washing my hair and then put the soaking wet towel back on my neck and shoulders. i made her take it off. then unbelievably, she could not figure out how to turn on the flat iron  and had to get help from another stylist.  from there i knew i was in trouble.  she barely dried my hair and started to attempt to use the flat iron,which if you know anything about flat ironing, would have fried my hair. fortunately, i looked over at the manager, darleen, who came over and tried to help the stylist at which point i asked to just dry my hair and let me out of there.  my stylist couldn't even pull that off and the manager again tried to help. at this point i just told them to finish drying my hair without styling. at the checkout counter the stylist tried to charge me a for a shampoo and full blow dry/style until the manager told her that she couldn't do that and only charged me for a shampoo.  i have never not left a tip but this time i refused to. in addition, i have been to several upscale salons in the dallas area and have paid a reasonable amount for the same service. had this experience gone flawlessly, at this low cost chain salon, the cost they quoted me when i got there would have been for the shampoo and then another $40.00 for the flat iron which is an outrageous amount of money!  i plan on calling corporate office of great clips on monday and sharing this with the district manager. awful, awful experience!!"
"i've been going here since 1997, yes, that's 14 years.  why do i keep going here?  because i'm a creature of habit and don't like change.  i know what to expect and my expectations are almost always met, sometimes exceeded.  when i was unemployed and volunteering full time, the stylists wouldn't accept a tip from me, that's probably a pretty good reason too.at regular price, the haircut is a little pricey.  but i almost never pay full price.  previously, they had a $50 gift card that you could get a free haircut, so it was, 4 haircuts for the price of 3.  not too shaggy, i mean shabby.  they stopped doing that and went to the $9.99 unlimited haircut gift card.  buy as many haircuts as you want for $9.99 but they had to be purchased before a certain day.  i bought 10.  recently, they had a card that gave you two free haircuts in april, deeply discounted in may, somewhat discounted in june, so on so forth.  not too bad, plus you can get coupons in the money mailer for $6.99.i've seen many a hair stylist come and go and i'd say the experience and talent of the stylists has remained the same.  some are better than others, but i'm not too choosy.  i'd rather get in and out quickly, than wait for a particular scissor.  my hair has never been messed up, but it has been cut shorter than i wanted.a couple things i've learned here.  cowlicks can only be mitigated, not eliminated.  hair paste is much better than gel (at least for my thick unmanageable hair).  if you come into the shop with a hat and are all sweaty, you get a free rinse!"
"great place to go if you want to get your hair cut and be treated by rude staffhaircuts are ok, staff is about as rude as you will find"
i got a hair cut here yesterday and i asked for a trim. she didn't wet my hair to cut it and i have wavy hair so that obviously isn't gonna work. my hair cut was done in about 7 mins and it is not straight at all
"as with any place like this, you can get good and not so good.  ask for tiffany. she has cut hair for me and my sons for the last several months and done an excellent job."
been going here since 2007. it's going to be my last visit here today. worst haircut of my life last two times. my 'hairstylist' today was someone brenda torres. last name torres for sure. it was 2 pm and not even crowded to think she may have done it to get moving faster. i have attached a pic so you would realize what messy job she did with the sides. my haircut was complete in less than 4 minutes. all she asked me was if i wanted to buy those conditioners and gels they display. i know it is great clips and can't expect anything good - but can you at the least cut the hair like an average grade barber?can't wait to have my hair back and go to a better barber. thanks great clips for ruining it. not giving you a chance ever again.
"one of the worst saloon. the guy who did the hair cut was very fast and started doing in his own style, despite i told him my style at the very beginning. i don't recommend."
"been going for a while.  at first watched and observed who people were requesting.  most ask for cee.  since i've been going to cee, have always had good cuts."
"unfortunately this place is getting very greedy. not only have they increased their prices, but they're now getting rid of both the utd discount and the $9.99 haircut cards. they say they're more of an ""upscale"" salon, so that's why it's more, but as you'll see from other reviews the service is on par with salons like the ones you'll find at walmart."
please don't go to the arab or indian or mexican looking lady there. she just cut off my side burns without giving me opportunity to do anything. i am so furious right now.
i been coming here for years and they are always appreciate me  coming here. i recommend this place to anyone. you can always online check in too since place is always packed with utd student.
i have blunt cut bangs that needed a basic trim. the lady who cut my hair named bunny gave me the worst hair cut of my life. she had nooo idea what she was doing. she tried to layer it? when i really did not ask for that then there are just huge chunks out of my now super short and uneven bangs. she tried to send me on my way when one side of my bangs was a whole 21/2 inches longer than the other side. i politely asked her to even them out. man did i make the wrong move by asking her to touch my hair again because yes she cut the long side short. really really short. . i asked her to leave my bangs touching my eyebrows and they are now half way to up my forehead and too short to even clip back to hide this horrid job. if a little asian lady named bunny tries to cut your hair. run out the door. she is awful.now i have to live with this horrible excuse of a hair cut. seriously didn't even know it was possible to mess it up this bad. i wish i could post a picture. it's almost comical.
it's not too bad as most of yelpers comments. don't forget the price is inexpensive. impossible for you want everything with low price.
"i've been a customer here for the last 13 years, but not any more.  the online checkin app is a complete joke.  it will tell you there is a 1 minute wait, then you will show up and wait for 20 after you checked in online.  i would say my last three hair cuts have been bad, and have gotten worse each time.  today, i had an asian lady (not that it matters... many of the good stylists i have had over the years are of asian origin)...  but this one could not speak english well enough to do her job... i would ask her a question like ""are you making it straight in the back"" and she would answer with ""thank you""...  um... what?   hair cut was terrible, but i couldn't explain well enough what i needed done.walked out frustrated and i think it showed... one of the regular stylists stopped me to ask if everything was ok...  i just asked if i could have a brush to brush my hair (which was still dripping wet), paid (no tip) and walked out.  won't be back.  you shouldn't be back either."
horrible service!!! if your not a man do not go here as they will rush through your hair cut to make more money! they will not even wet your hair prior to cutting it! to top it off when i asked to have someone else finish the hair cut on my child the employee hit me on my hand and began to scream!! when i called to speak with a manager they blew it off! bad service!
i have been going here at this place since last 1.5 years and every time i have returned with a shabby haircut. the only good thing is you get a utd discount. not going there henceforth now!
nothing extraordinary about this place. my hair has been messed up a couple of times. the bald guy is good. you get some discount if you are a utd student (that's probably the best part).
i have been going to this place for years and britney does a great job! most of the staff is the same since i have been going so that's always a plus and they all do a great job! britney is the bomb though she will give some great advice when your not sure what you want !
"i've been here twice and i absolutely love this place! the first time i came in i was 8 months pregnant and had my toddler with me, my stylist was so patient with my baby (she was getting antsy because it was nap time). my hair was so long and i just wanted to chop it all off. she gave me the best haircut, just like how i wanted it. and today i went in to get a trim because my hair had gotten long again. and i had the perfect experience once again. i totally recommend this place. clean place and the staff is super friendly"
"the woman here are so classy and beautiful in their physical and spiritual appearance.shout out to brittany, keisha, ann maria, loren and marlene . they are so kind and loving towards me when i go there. i've been blessed by them. may god continue to bless their business. love you ladies"
fat lady with pink hair was so rude. literally kicked my kid out because he was slightly upset and crying even though he wasn't moving or refusing to be cut. he is slightly autistic and upset with noises and the lady not apologetic and said find business elsewhere. extremely rude. never go to this location.
"the hair stylists are great people but at the end of the day, my hair is crooked. i asked for a three inch trim and normally go to a great clips type place if i'm not doing anything drastic. i ended up with 1.5 inches cut on the left side and 2 inches cut on the right. kind of guesstimating those measurements, but the point is that one side is definitely longer than the other. the hair isn't even on each side either so it's really an all around disappointment. i'm too scared to go back and get it fixed for fear that they chop off more with the same janky result."
i went in for seriously one of the easiest haircuts someone can do... a trim. i have long hair and i wanted 2 inches trimmed off but after looking at it closer when i got home i noticed the guy who cut it wasn't able to cut it evenly. you can imagine my frustration. i wouldn't recommend this place.
"i have been in dallas for 8 years, before that i lived in san diego, ca and had the same hair dresser for 18 years. i have been back to san diego for a visit and returned to my hair dresser but my visits were few and far between. i have tried several different stylists in dallas but none of them seem to know how to cut my hair to my satisfaction, at least until i went to great cuts. the lady there did a great job. she listened to what i wanted and did exactly what i requested. their prices are reasonable and they have a senior discount which is a plus on a low income."
i went for a shortish hair cut but the woman cut literally all of my hair off and made me look like a child. when i asked her what she was doing she said she was going to go as it develops. now i have a hair cut that is nothing like i wanted and never recommend going here. horrorible experience and doesn't listen at all.this woman should not be cutting hair at all. don't go here if you want your hair cut not to go right.
"in and out in less than ten minutes. half of the haircut timing was spent stylist/butcher chatting to another. my hair style instructions said a little on the top, and yet 1/3 of the length was chopped. very unpleased and unhappy"
"worst corporate policies ever.  can't even go in to set an appointment for the person you want to cut your hair, no times for when available and most of their stylist are new and do not know how to properly cut hair.  i want the only person there who has ever cut my hair properly but can't get her standard working hours as great cuts changes them all the time, can't ask for her online as that is not an option, can't go into the facility to make an appointment.  worse customer service by a corporation ever!!!! do not use!!"
"about a month ago, i had posted a negative review about this place.however, they have changed my mind today, and i need to fix my comment. i guess i just got bad luck when i was there last time.the manager not only give me a free hair cut, but she also makes sure that i got the best person in the store to fix my hair, even after a month ago. of course, every staffs are talented and have amazing study hands. they will cut and fix your hair on point ... i don't write this review because they give me a free hair cut. i just thought those hard working stylists should be appreciated and customers should come to this place if they wanna get their hair done in the best way. i wish i had known every hair stylist's names... so, i could list the best ones and prefer to the new clients. as i said, most of people, who work there, are great. so... if you did have bad experiences, like me. don't abandon this place. just come back, talk to the manager. she will fix everything for you and you won't be sorry. i just can't stop smiling at my new hair"
i've gotten a hair cut from every staff member.  most do a good job.   nothing to complain about here.  staff is very friendly. my suggestion is to open up yourself as a customer and you will get great service.  music is up with lots of laughter.  good place to get your grooming on.
my hair was very dry and rough. the lady started off with complaining about my hair. she cut it in like 2-3 minutes. i ask her  to re touch up the sides and she gives me a look like shes doing it for free so im not supposed to ask twice or something. and she does it in a hurry. prices are reasonable but not their attitudes. bad experience uh oh
"the way they cut was pitiable with absolutely no perfection in handling and working with the scissors. i could say that either she never got any formal training in hair cutting or she was totally ignorant. she kept blabbering away with the other stylist who was cutting my boyfriend's hair. his haircut also turned out quite messy with jagged lines and uneven lengths. she was also a little rude and stared at him when he asked her to do make some changes, seemed like she had to run off somewhere. we have got better haircuts for the same price in other salons."
"this review is for matthew keys, not for great clips!it's been a while since i last visited dallas and every time i need my hair done, not just done, but correctly, i always hit up matthew.  he is by far the best that i have ever been to and he knows what the hell he is doing.  he's a rock star, and a god with his profession.  i've been to quite a few hairstylist/ barbers in dallas and i have t found any i like, until matthew came along.  not only is he a great person to do your hair, he will also exceed your expectations.  you'd be a fool to not go to matthew!"
my boyfriend and i went into this great clips on a sunday afternoon after being referred to matthew keys from numerous 5 star reviews at his old salon. we were not disappointed! matthew cut my boyfriends hair exactly how we asked and was so nice and quick! my boyfriend looks for things to be cheap and efficient and this was above and beyond those expectations. we will definitely be back in here to see matthew for future hair needs. you can text him directly to see when he's working- but it sounds like he's in there ~6 days a week. +1 (214) 394-8678
super busy locale but you can check in online for your appointment!
matthew keys is so awesome. my favorite barber and i have yet to get a less than superb haircut!
"absolute disappointment. i took my 13 year old son in and the 'stylist' did about half of what i specifically asked her to do.  not that it was anything special, just clean up and shorten a typically teenage mop of hair.then at the end she just laughed, thinking somehow my comments of specific deficiencies were funny.obviously zero tip and won't be returning..."
"i'm new to town, and when looking for a new place to get my hair cut, this great clips had the best rating in the area. i checked it out, and it's obvious why.i checked in online, so didn't have to wait very long when i arrived. that's an important step to take though, because this place is busy!i told my stylist what i was looking for and she went above and beyond. she was kind, checked in with me as we were going along to make sure that it was to my liking. she was so professional, fun, and overall great at her job.i'm really pleased with my haircut here and would strongly recommend it. i will absolutely be back. also, if you live in the area, watch your mail because i got a coupon for a $6.99 haircut. great price and great haircut!"
got a haircut here about 3 weeks ago. staff was friendly and efficient. will return when i am on this side of town
"wish i could give negative stars or even 0!this place has gone down hill in the past 6 months to year. different stylists at every visit. went in today to only have the absolute worse cut ever in my life. she never spoke, never confirmed what the ticket said, never asked me anything. i felt like a couple of times i thought my ears were going to get cut off. feel certain this was one of her first cuts and had no idea what to do. now i need to find a new place for hair cuts. do not go to this great clips ever. i will report to their hq. today the owner of the location contacted me to apologize and discuss my experience. he assured this issue with the stylist has been resolved. very nice for the owner to reach out to me. i will return."
"took my daughter there for an updo, never had been there before. tatiana did an excellent job with my daughter's hair and it stayed all night!! she made my daughter feel right at home by interacting with her throughout the process. she is such an awesome person! also reasonably priced! if you are looking for a great stylist, ask for tatiana!"
"first off, go see claudia, she's awesome! i have very tricky hair, i.e. cowlicks & wavy, she nailed it! i showed her a picture of the style i was looking to achieve she offered input and the final look sparked compliments since. great personality and talent, what more could you ask for?now besides great stylists, as the other girl working was very friendly and stylish as well, the store is well kept. smells nice, very clean, as well as the tools are well cleaned & maintained. last but certainly not least in today's economy, the price was very reasonable. i will certainly be back and if you're in the area and need a cut this should be your first stop... and ask if claudia is available lol."
"we came here because our normal place, sports clips, raised their prices.  here, they are having a back to school special for kids- $7.99 haircut.  the cut was decent, not fantastic but not horrible, but the woman was a tough nut to crack.  my little guy is a total charmer but this lady didn't want to smile or talk to him.  it was odd.  but his hair looks a bit more clean cut for preschool tomorrow."
"if your normal stylist isn't there, be prepared to get skipped. got there, checked in, waited a few mins (nobody else there, mind you) some other person walks in gets checked in and the lady calls him over. the stylist tried to explain that he was there earlier and left. he was removed from the check in log, so in theory, he lost his place in line, right?? nope, she puts him back on the list and calls him first and decides to skip me. wow, way to be fair! thanks for making me feel like a wanted customer!! bye!"
"only went to check it out because of $6 haircut coupon.  was maybe worth $0.25. don't remember her name but lady in the front was less than friendly , couldn't make any type of conversation during mediocre haircut. 2 stars because it does has reasonable prices. save your $ and get pizza next door :)"
"i am not very particular on who cuts my hair as long as they do a good job.  when you get your hair cut here the first time they record it in the computer and print out that request the next time you show up.  they always confirm that is still how i want my hair cut.  the employees have always been polite, some are more talkative than others and most importantly the haircut has always been consistently good.  the whole family goes here and none of us have ever had an issue.  there is also a military discount as long as you bring some sort of id."
tatiana did a fabulous cut and style for me!!  came in on my lunch hour using online check in and she listened to what i needed and made it happen.  added plus was that she has a great personality and i really enjoyed getting to know her.  price is very affordable too!
"tatiana is the best stylist ever. i usually just let anyone cut my hair but not anymore. 6 weeks ago she cut my hair in a cute short style and even when it grew out i was getting complements. i love great clips and i love my stylist, she is very talented and super friendly!!!!!"
meghan did such an awesome job cutting my girls hair that i came back the next night to have her cut mine! we all love our new haircuts.
"been going to this place for over a year now. i am always pleased with the service and great attitudes from the ladies. tatiana and mystery specifically, are always on top of things. they always do a great job, and are great folks as well!"
i have brought my son here since he was 3. michelle always does an amazing job and she's fast!
"i have been here two times in the last couple weeks taking my kids for haircuts. my little boy was given a stylish haircut that i am very pleased with. i figured after having a good experience and a coupon from my receipt that i'd go again for my little girl.i went in and the worker started asking a few questions about what i wanted to do for my little girls hair. i told her and she kept telling me, "" no you don't want to do that."" she kept repeating that even after i'd ask why not. she kept saying we'll give her a trim which i had already mentioned i wanted her hair cut and even. this was her first haircut. well the haircut turned out horribly. she then goes to blame it on my girl for ""moving"" well, first off, she's two and she wasn't moving that much because i had her on my lap and keeping her pretty still. she chopped her bangs so high and barely touched the part i actually wanted her to cut. i was not a fan of the stylist and i could tell it was not going to end well, she was older and seemed to not be up to date on the styles. let's just say i'll return but be more selective on who gets to cut my kids hair."
"i really like this place because it's so conveniently located.  it is probably a 5 minuted drive down the street from me.  the online check-in app is great... and really cuts the wait time in half, if not more.  i've been coming to this location for about 2 years now, and come in for a cut maybe  every 2 1/2 to 3 weeks.  they def. make you feel at home because they greet you right when you walk in the doors.  they def. know me by now and it's easy to feel comfortable.  i do have my go-to stylist.  they are all very personable and strike up pretty interesting conversations.  only a couple times i have felt a little unimpressed/unsatisfied with the work done.  on one occasion they gave me a taper, but totally forgot to do the other side!  i didn't bring it up at that moment because i did not notice it right away. thankfully i knew how to fix the situation myself with my own clippers back at home.  on one of my more recent visits, the stylist adamantly thought she knew what i should do with my hair, even though it was not what i was asking for.  i ultimately got my way and she cut it how i wanted it but it was just shocking that she kept trying to cut it her way.   with that being said, i now ask for particular stylist to cut my hair. that easily remedies those situations from happening in the future.  i'm due for a cut at the end of this week and let's see how it goes."
very choppy. layers weren't blended and they stick out i have to wear a ponytail until my hair grows out
my teen son got his haircut here. he's very picky and really liked the cut. we will definitely be back!
"horrible.  had a bad experience the first time and returned (shouldn't have) hoping it will be better.  majority of the workers are rude and are not genuine on their ""welcome to great clips"" or their thank u s.  i will definitely not be returning nor my husband."
"hadn't been there in years (since the stylist i liked left), decided to go back and try my luck with it being under new management. my hair was short but wasn't quite how i hoped for (having it cut about a 2 wks prior to this visit). the wait wasn't  long at all, i was actually #8 on the list so about 10 min later i'm in the chair. michelle listened to what i wanted, then did exactly what i hoped the outcome would be..i was so happy (finally). the other stylists there all seem friendly & i enjoyed chatting with them. the establishment is very well kept & clean & they now have an app that you can check yourself in and cut the wait time. as long as michelle will be there i'll definitely be back..thank you michelle"
"this was my first time at this particular great clips. i walked in on a tuesday afternoon around 4 , the wait was about 15 minutes.  i showed the hairdresser a picture of the haircut i wanted, she wavered back and forth on what type of clippers to use.  she did not seem confident in her estimation of the length of hair a particular clipper would cut. after she was done, the hairline was not uniformly even and i asked her to repeat the process.  when it was all done, i found out later that the back of my hair was also not cut evenly.  for $13 haircuts, i will not return to this location.  there are places closer in houston that will cut your hair for $5 and do a better job."
great place for boys haircuts! i use their app to sign in and hold my queue before heading up to the salon. really makes it efficient to take care of their hair between obligations.their hours are convenient  and promotions are a great deal. all with a great haircut by a friendly barber!
"very good salon. i can walk in here and get the perfect haircut for a reasonable price. this is a great place if you want to get your hair styled for not that much money. the stylists are helpful, and they listen. remember to check in online to avoid wait times!"
"i have the worst luck with hair stylists... in that when i find a good one, they leave the salon/move away/quit doing hair within the year. so i'm constantly on the prowl for a good stylist that isn't going to break the bank when i need a cut! i was in desperate need of a hair cut, and hadn't had the time to find a new 'permanent' stylist, so in a desperate attempt to look decent before heading back to work after having a baby, i took myself to the oak forest great clips one night for a quick cut. they do offer online check in, which also displays the current wait time for a stylist. there being no wait (and only about 5 minutes down the road), i opted to not check in online and headed straight over. there not being a wait actually meant that i had to wait for the stylists to finish the customers they had, then clean up, and then it was my turn in the chair. this was approximately 12 minutes after arriving at the shop, which was 630pm one night (30 mins before closing). i'm not sure if there are options for hair cuts, but i wasn't asked anything when checking in (wash and style, just a cut, etc) but i wanted a wash, cut, and style at the end, which isn't what i got. i got a dry cut and left with wet hair- ugh! i hate that, because i couldn't tell how the layers looked. it's stressful enough getting a hair cut by someone new, but when you can't even check the quality of the work until you get home is agonizing. the stylist was also not friendly at all, she kept talking with her coworkers the whole time i was being served. i'm not usually one to chat, but i felt like an intruder in her fun chat time circle, which made me more uncomfortable. being a nervous wreck from the experience and the new stylist, you might be wondering 'why 3 stars then?' the cut turned out to be ok, i wasn't in tears when i got home and dried it out. was it amazing, the best hair cut i've had in years? no. would i recommend coming here? again, probably not... unless you don't care much how the cut turns out and want something basic done. i may not be coming back, but i did get my hair trimmed up and looking much less crazy, and bought myself a few more months to find a permanent stylist!"
check ins mean absolutely nothing here ! i checked in thirty minutes prior and still have to wait while they let others cut in front. very unorganized and didn't even know we were here before or were here to check in.
i need to know where carla went to. she was the best hair stylist there. somebody please let me know some thing. thank you!
"i cant believe that carlita is not anymore with you guys, she was the best stylist ever and she was the only reason that i drive 10 miles to this great clips ,"
i have never gone to get a haircut and had the stylist be so rude as to skip me to get the woman behind me in line because she had requested her. i usually get my hair cut here but this is the worst service i have ever seen. the other stylist even said he is next and she said no she was waiting.i told her to take me off the list i'll get my hair cut else where.
"you can't beat this $13 haircut. my ""do"" is nothing too special, so i trust the great clips staff to trim it up just the way i want it, and even to shape my side bangs. the staff is very friendly. i've had cuts by three of them, two gals and a guy. they're down to earth and i always have a great conversation. this is my ""go-to"" to get rid of those nasty split ends."
these hair sylists have messed up my kids' hair twice! i don't know why i keep coming back.
"loud, rude employees who should be ashamed of their profanity-laden language."
my haircut is easy and can't be messed up.  they do the job based on what i ask for.
been coming here for so many years.  i'm always greeted by name and get great service. love that i'm able to check in through the app for a less wait time.
"this little strip mall location was polite to accept two of us right at closing time!  my cut was done quickly and professionally- my friend said he was pleased but that his stylist was really ""new"" and didn't seem like she was comfortable in the role yet."
"in my great clips has changed with the staff, geslle and tameka were the only people i've trusted and they left and i have fortunately found them if anyone would like to know where they are at message me."
"after coming to this location religiously for several years, it's time to search for another place to get my haircut. the last several times i have visited, the haircuts and shampoos have been sub par. additionally, there is a specific employee who will bother you continuously trying to up sell products. i say no, and she asks. ""are you sure?"" this goes on a couple of times. i finally told her she's being pushy and she replies that she's only joking. pretty tacky. same haircut person today and the photo is the back of my shirt after a shampoo. ugg. she asked if i wanted some product on my hair and i said yes, some gel. she then tries to use a gel product that's new, i tel her i use a specific brand and then she offers an even lesser priced brand. uggh. they have the brand there because i buy it from their shop and there was an open bottle at another station, but i guess she didn't want to spend the extra .15 of product. :(also, two of the stylists were speaking badly about the owner or manager. don't know if they realized i could hear them, but another reason not to return to great clips. the location has taken a noticeable turn for the worse in ambience and quality. recommend sports clips right across the street. they have much better reviews and stylists."
"this place is not the same without tomeka. i've been getting my haircut at this location for 2 years now and i've been able to trust almost the entire staff (dulce, tomeka, and kristen are great) when i drop in for random visits. they must have replaced most of the staff after tomeka's exit because i don't recognize any of the new stylists, and no offense, they aren't nearly as good. so not only are the stylists not as good but now they shove product marketing down your throat the entire visit. very sad day.  you can tell it's new management/ownership... and it's just not good."
"since tomeka left the energy in the salon has shifted, and not really for the better. a lot of gossiping across to each other (sometimes about other customers), and just overall downgrade in customer service with the newer staff. i only go for dulce now. if she's not there, i'm not getting a hair cut."
"on a normal basis i would give this place a good score, but today, only a few flipping days before christmas we made a big mistake by coming to the wrong person! my 15 year old has wonderful hair.  all he wanted was a trim. we told her that!  terrible hair cutter.  just chop chop chop away.  i guess i should have babysat her while she was chopping away. this is no trim. and then. they were like ""well don't pay"".  what?! it is not about not paying!!!!  it is about doing what the customer wants. we specifically told her that he likes it long.  to leave it over the ears...long in the back. look at these pictures. go practice on someone else.  not my son. lady needs more training before she gets paid again to cut hair.  listen to the customer.  not every man wants short hair. and then they blamed my 15 year old for not speaking up?! jerks. manager and owner need to contact me!"
"i just had an amazing hair cut experience with tameka. she was very professional and quick but showed great attention to detail. i felt that she really cared about how my haircut turned out. she mentioned that she wanted my hair to look great because she is ""putting her name on it.""this kind of accountability and pride in work is hard to find these days especially with a haircut under $20.thank you tameka and i will request you from now on."
i've been getting my haircut at great clips for a little over a year since i arrive to houston.the stylist's have always done a good job for me. i've had my hair done by other salon's in the surrounding area and this particular great clips seems to have their act together. the management and staff is receptive paying close attention to my hairstyle even if i don't know what i want to be done with it. and if i don't they provide me with good examples and deliver satisfying results.i've had my hair styled from everyone on the staff. there isn't anyone here that doesn't know what they're doing. i'm immensely pleased and as long as i'm in houston i will continue giving them my business. and the price is nice always falling under $10. can't beat that unless you're deployed. :)
"i've been to many different locations of great clips and this one remains my favorite. even though i have to drive 1/2 hour, i prefer it to the three locations near me. i've had both crystal and jess cut my hair and i'm very happy both times."
"great haircut for a great price! i am a female with long hair and could not believe it was just $13. dulce cut my hair and she did a magnificent job! i would highly recommend great clips to anyone who wants to save money and get a great, fast haircut. i was in and out in less than 20 minutes!"
"the wait time here is not good they need more help. the hair cuts are decent, if you need a quick cut and nothing special this would be a great place for just that."
"how does a chain haircut store get 5 stars?  let me drop some knowledge on you.i pulled into the parking lot and got the spot closest to the door.  when i walked in i was promptly greeted, and did not even have to sit down in the waiting area.  i was led straight to a chair.  this was at 5pm on a week day; when i believe it should be turbo busy.  upon being seated my stylist talked with me about my haircut.  it was not the usual formality, she really discussed how she was going to cut my hair, and what she was trying to achieve.  i appreciated the focus, and i did not feel like a part of an assembly line.  she cut my hair exactly like she said, and i was very pleased with the results.so i got a great haircut with no wait.  that's good.  now what made it five stars?  the price.  it was $6.99!  i haven't had a haircut that cheap since i was a kid and my mom would drop me at the navy base to get my ""regular boy haircut.""  i wonder if there was an ""irregular boy haircut?""  i will probably never know.  either way, i will be going back!"
dulce is the best by far! she always listens to what i want and delivers! always in and out. she is super sweet and i  hope she stays for a while! love my hair!
i stopped by before jumping a flight to dallas for a big sales meeting with a customer the following day. one of the worst hair cuts i've ever gotten. i told the lady to taper the back & use razor #2.5 to fade halfway up then blend it. this b**** use #1 & scalped me. look at the picture...it's uneven & looks like i'm losing hair. i was furious & refused to pay! i walked out & told her it was the worst hair cut i've ever gotten. a customer in the chair behind me looked at me & said - wow that is bad!
"what ever you do, criticizing an employee named jazelle will get you on her bad side. she does not take criticism well and i won't be going back for sure after having her cut my hair for the past couple of years."
"ahh, it's ok.it will grow up again. why?? could be my fault communicating what i wanted.very polite and cheerful girls otherwise!!"
"great experience! checked in online after getting my car washed and upon arrival, i waited less than 5 minutes.i will definitely be coming back to this location.service was great and stylists were friendly and complimentary of my haircut ;)yu"
"they lost a customer for sure. i have been going here for the 2 years i've lived in town. at first, things were ok, but then they start adding notes on my haircut. they never listened to the words i was saying, ""cut my hair short!"" all they did was follow the notes, that were wrong.i've had three of the worst haircuts back to back to back. i tried, but this is ridiculous. listen to your customer, if i say 2 on the side, don't give me a 3-4 crap fade. if i say cut it as short as your finger lengths will go, do that!i cut my own hair this morning fixing this place. don't go here. not worth it!"
"since there really isn't much to tell, this will be quite a short review. haircuts for men are almost $20 and combined with subpar customer service and performance this wouldn't be the first place i send a friend."
called at 8:52pm asking if i could get a quick hair wash and they said they'd take me if i got there before 9. i got there in time and was only $5. lucky they took me and price so reasonable.
do not allow charlotee i believe is her name ever cut your hair. i specifically said i have sensitive skin and scalp please use scissors she refused and only would use clippers. i politely asked if she did not know how to cut the style i've been getting for years at great clips is in my notes with no issues and she only responded it's the same. she severely screwed up my hair. worst hairstylist and customer service ever.
"extremely fast and high quality haircuts and very cheap. their online system makes it easy to see how long the wait is and get your name on the list from home, avoiding wasted time. they also keep your haircut preferences stored in their system making it more consistent. highly recommend getting your haircut with lydia, kim or margerita. i've had experiences with other barber shops where it was awkward to tell a stylist to make a change at the end but here they will ask you at the end and be very chill about anything that you ask to change (e.g. asking for a shorter cut)."
"my husband recently got a haircut at this location from michelle. he has been here multiple times in the past, and has always had a good experience. as soon as he got home i noticed how much care and detail she took on his haircut and style, even slightly trimming his facial hair to match his new style. great job, great effort."
"this location is awesome!!! the stylist are always attentive and genuine. ms. charlotte cuts my hair every week and she is always super sweet. she knows exactly how to cut my hair, but the best part is that she is always asking how i'm doing. i love this location."
"been going to this location for two years.  first stylist was excellent but relocated.  have used my current stylist, named charlotte, for about a  year.   she always does a good job. some stylists listen to you and then do what they want.  she always asks how you want your hair cut and cuts it that way. charlotte wants you to be satisfied with your hair cut and in addition, she has a great personality."
very fast service but terrible haircut. i asked for just the the ends of the top of my hair to he cut and se took of like an inch! awful haircuts
i've been to this location several times now and each time the haircuts get worse. it's safe to say i won't be going back because my hair couldn't take a worse haircut than my last one here.
love the online check in. i drive from katy to this location because of fredia. i only want her to cut my hair. i've been to other locations but keep coming here. the music can be a little louder than i like but not that bad.  i gave five stars for fredia but everyone else here would be a 3 and 1/2 to 4.
"have been coming here over a year.  your experience will vary greatly based upon who you get. as others mentioned, fredia is great. however, they seem to have high turnover because i often end up with someone i haven't seen before with varying quality. the last haircut was terrible. the young lady was sweet, but literally didn't know how to cut my hair and all i get is a buzz with 2, 3, 4. i'm questioning whether she had been through any training at all or had a license. the other lady had to come over and try to help her, but it just ended up being a mess. it's noticeably longer on one side.  i have tried other locations as well and had another bad haircut there as well so i gave this one another try. just looking for some place i can get a simple buzz with clippers, but it seems to be a challenge!"
"don't bother. first time coming here, was not even acknowledged by anyone to be checked-in but two others walk in 5 minutes later and got checked-in.they don't believe in helping everyone apparently."
best hairstylist in town! ask for tamika!  very attentive and receptive for hair needs. will give you constructive feed back! been coming to her for past year!
"sometimes you just need a simple haircut.  my default hair cutting chain has been tgf, because most of the times you know what you're going to get.  nothing too fancy, but they won't totally screw up your hair.  well unfortunately, the tgf near my house sucks! so i had to search for another simple hair salon.  good ole yelp showed me that there was this great clips not far from my house.  i called and they were open until 5 pm on a sunday.  i wish they were open a little later, but this will do.  we came at about 4 pm and they had about 8 total booths and 5 of them being filled with a stylist.  which was a pleasant surprise because even though the waiting room was full, we were able to get into a chair fairly quickly.  they keep notes in the system so that when you come back the next time you can have the same stylist and similar hair cut.  it's $14 for a basic cut which is comparable to most basic salons."
"i don't know who i had for a hair stylist this time, but i normally come here for a trim and i always get the same lady who is super sweet and nice. she always does my hair really well. this time however, i came in wanting to donate my hair and cutting it right below the shoulder. i didn't get either one. the lady cut off 8 inches of hair which left my hair below my shoulders. which isn't enough to donate. i wasn't mad i couldn't donate it, i just wanted her to keep the hair at the same length it was or trim off a little bit (maybe an inch at most) but she cut off 3 inches more of my hair! leaving me with a dora hair cut, that is not only uneven but also unbelievably short. i have picture day at school in a week and i don't know what i'm supposed to do with this mess"
they don't not know how to cut black people hair at all they messed up my friends haircut and only used one kind a clippers the whole time and cut her hair uneven
came in for a simple haircut and beard trim. my directions are always very clear. number 2 on sides and fingerlength up top .. just enough to comb backwards. my hair dresser was difficult to communicate with because she was not very good at english. she was showing me the back and turning me loose. i had to tell her it was to long and that she had forgotten my beard.she makes the top a little shorter and then does my beard with the same number 2 large clippers used on my head. she uses no smaller or more precision clippers required. as a result my beard looks unkept and lazy. i'll have to redo it myself. she was clearly uncomfortable as if she had never done it. i'm not one to start trouble so i paid my bill. tipped and left. i'm not sure she would even have understood my directions to fix it. not sure what i paid for as i'm going to have to do it properly myself. this is the second great clips i've been to that did a rushed sloppy job on my beard.maybe they should just stop offering them?the get it right about 60% of the time and it's 1/2 the price of a haircut. gonna have to find somewhere else.
"i was done with people that either don't speak english and/or only know one hairstyle for men.this place was good for me until my last 2 haircuts. yesterday was terrible as i had let my hair grow out for a ""pompadour"" style only to be mowed down by yet another hair stylist from their never ending turnaround.it will grow back and blah blah blah but what really pisses me off is having to pay $14 plus tip for a -5 dollar haircut-"
"these were the nicest and most professional staff i've experienced since living in houston. i went to sports clips and had the worst haircut of my life. i immediately drove to great clips to explain what happened and multiple stylists gathered around to help fix my hair cut. they truly cared about providing me with a satisfying experience. my hair looked 100xs better when they were done. i will never go anywhere else in houston. if you need a hair cut and want to have a great experience while you get one, go to great clips at myerland."
"so i've had rather inconsistent experiences with this place before, which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to running a business, but this last experience was just inexcusable and led me to vow to never stray from my usual barber no matter how inconvenient his scheduling.this place has done for me in a pinch in the past but the experience of the barbers/stylists (which they don't seem to hold onto) can vary widely.  in my last experience i decided to use great clips app to check in.  50 minutes and the timer starts counting down.  okay, so i can chill at home and check in a few minutes before my supposed appointment (after all, it is a timer counting down to zero - a survey of my friends seems to make this a reasonable assumption).  arrive ten minutes ahead of time according to the counter and take a seat.  after waiting 15 minutes and noticing people walking in and going ahead of me i get suspicious.  look at the app...seems it reset to 33 minutes.really?  this is doctor scheduling.  they overschedule and plan for people to be late/cancel and end up with a waiting room of people sitting around for hours.  i hate it when my doctor does it and i hate it when a business does it.  my usual barber knows what an appointment means and will have you seated within seconds walking into the door.after waiting another 15 minutes i finally get called up.  i sit down and make my request (zero around, clippers up top to style).  it's not the easiest haircut to make look good, but i've consistently tipped well to make up for this.  what do i get?  ""do you mind waiting for another girl?  i don't know how to do zeros.""she wasn't rude.  she was perfectly polite and reasonable.  but, from my understanding, i just walked into a haircut place and sat down for half an hour only to be told ""i don't know how to cut fucking hair!!!!""  if i sat down at a shoe repair place and got this response that would be reasonable.  if you asked me i think it'd be reasonable since i didn't go to fucking school for this career.  but why the hell are you here with clippers and a pair of scissors if you don't know how to fucking use them!?  even if her response was to offer to attempt it but tell me she has never done it before, i would have been fine.  my not having a haircut at that moment would be on me.  but this was just fucking ridiculous.skip it.  go to matt over at bellaire's original barber shop.  he may cut old conservative white dudes for a living but he won't even flinch if you request a hitler youth cut - and he'll do it well."
"haircut days are the best. i love this place. as a low-maintenance kind of girl, i feel totally comfortable and happy coming here. though the clientele is majority male, they do ladies hair just perfectly. i was shocked to be able to walk right in on a saturday at noon, and be immediately placed in a chair. ana did a perfect job, just what i wanted, was kind and conversational but didn't waste time either. great place for a basic trim, undercut, short cut, or more complex stuff. (my understanding is the only thing they do not do is color.) kudos, beechnut location!"
"i can't stand this place. been here several times hoping to think it would get better but apart from a few good experiences, they've all been horrible. the latest experience (12/31/17) was unsurprisingly miserable. the woman who cut my hair interacted with me like a robot and refused to understand how to communicate. i asked her for her thoughts and she goes, ""it's however you want it"". i could go on but i don't really care to and will never be back at this miserable place again."
"i usually use thuy, & she no longer works here and i am so sorry that i asked for a bob with a very long, angled front because i now have a bowl haircut and i have no idea what i am going to do with my hair tomorrow.  i am in tears & my hair looks really crappy.  why didn't i just ask for a trim?  if the lady had not spent all her time worrying that because i had curly hair, i wouldn't like the cut, she would have actually heard me say really long asymetrical front instead of bowl, which i am 100% certain i did *not* say."
online checkin gets you pushed to the front of the line and they have a mobile app to make it even easier!
"i can't comment much because i only use this place about once a year when i am visiting my old home town.  bottom line...plenty of stylists who can do plenty of options (i am a guy after all...how many ""options"" are there really???).  i do make life difficult with the way my hair can be and i have not had any problems from this place (though i have had issues with other places).  they also offer your typical haircare products and the staff is very friendly.there is a reason i always go back to them when i am home and i recommend them if you are in the area."
great clips great place!! amiling faces....i luv this place!
"while driving i tried to find a saloon, the gps pointed out that there is one in the next exit. with doubts i took the exit. it is a neat saloon without any big expenses. i walked out happy and satisfied. i never expected and now this is my to go place for haircut."
"for the price, this is as good as it gets. i always walk out of here symmetrical and well taken care of. their employees seem better trained."
i have been to other great clips and was surprised that they couldn't find me in their system. the other great clips did a great job cutting my brothers and my hair but this location is definitely not worth it. it is like they have not style hair before or be able to visualize how the customer will look if they took too much off on the side or on top. i will not be coming to this location again in the future.
"i am giving this great clips only one star due to the fact that their hairstylist (blue hair) moves at the pace of a dying sloth. i arrived and there was two people in front of me. for your information these two men were getting buzz cuts. i'm not a hair stylist, but i know that it should not take her an hour to complete two buzz cuts. having to wait that long is insane. they also take priority over online check ins even if you have been waiting for over an hour. i would save your time and go to sports clips one block over."
"i've taken my son there several times and the staff had been very nice, and cut my sons hair to our liking. today, we were there for about 15 minutes, someone walked in and was seen before us because he checked in online...which is a bad practice. the perception, because the woman didn't explain the procedure, was that because we are of another race (yeah i know, but just a perception) that those who may be perceived privileged got head of line. so, waited and asked the woman who cut my sons hair what was the practice, and she said she thought walk ins get seen first and checkins thereafter. check in just means that you have confirmed your appointment??? lastly, the quality of the hair cut was disappointing. positives, place was clean and tidy. dr. p"
we walks in to get the hubby a quick hair cut and got right in.  elizabeth did his cut and she did a great job! not too short and she did a scissor cut instead of with the clips.. looks wonderful and all for $14! who can beat that??
"worst haircut of my life, and i'm 57 years old so i've had a lot of poorly done haircuts but nothing like this disaster. now i have total anxiety about ever letting anyone ever touch my hair again."
"my regular hair stylist moved out of town, and i just haven't found a new one yet. however, my hair didn't get the memo that it needed to stop growing and splitting its ends, so in a last-ditch effort i came in to great clips for a trim. i have mixed feelings about this place, but haven't decided if i would go back. to make this review short and sweet, here are the pros and cons: pros:-open late and on the weekends-takes walk-ins-check in online and they'll be waiting for you when you arrive-cheap cheap cheap! $13 for my haircutcons:-i only got a haircut. no shampoo, no styling. it wasn't offered, but i would have taken a shampoo had it been offered. - the lady asked if i wanted my hair blow dried, and i said yes. however, she only blew my hair for about 2 minutes and i left with damp and unstyled hair. -my hair is crooked. since she didn't dry the style, i didn't notice until the next day when i straightened my hair, but the layers are choppy and there are random long strands hanging around my face. would have liked her to go into the layers and make them fall nicer. not like cake layers.i'm not at all pleased with the way my layers look, and she was only supposed to take off 1/2 an inch to trim up the bottom. i didn't imagine it would turn out crooked! i'm not sure if it was just this stylist or i'd they're all like this, but i would say use caution when coming here, and make sure to have them fully dry and straighten your hair to check the layers before you leave."
"terrible.  worst hair cut of my life.  stay away.  rude. asian women chopped off all my hair, talked about her african american co worker being robbed at gun point, and said homophobic statements such as: ""straight men don't take selfies"" and ""you look straight with short hair""....wtf????    the price is cheap -- and now my hair looks like i escaped from a mental hospital!!  she could not taper hair, trim edges, round the top.  no skills.  zero.  shouldn't even be allowed sharp objects.  she's a dangerous to society with scissors!this woman smelled bad and kept talking about how she dresses up as marline monroe and gets sexy for halloween.  so inappropriate. i will never go back -- and i hope you stay far far away from this business!!!"
"this review is for the vietnamese lady, i think her name is kim. don't get cut by her. you will regret it. everyone is an okay hairdresser but she ruined my hair by using thinning scissors without telling me on my curly hair and now you can see big patches of scalp on random places. its been 2 months since then and my hair is still bad. seriously man, i hate this woman."
"i took my 9 year old nephew jordan to great clips yesterday after his dental appointment. the barber named kenny cut him behind both ears. kenny was dishonest, unapologetic, and uncaring. he tried to hide the fact that he cut him then he proceeded to say, ""go ahead, report me, nothing can be done, these things happen."" i just know that in 8 years of getting haircuts jordan has never been cut. he cut him not once but twice...both ears. he blamed jordan then he blamed the clippers. took no responsibility, didn't even apologize. one ear has the skin shaved off and took a long time to stop bleeding. i sent photos with an email to the corporate office. the owner just called and said that kenny was ""talked to"" and is going to go through customer service training. i hope it helps his future customers because we will never go back."
trust the one star reviews.  went to get a shampoo and blow dry.  she charged me for the time she spent and not the service!  what!?  and that is why it took forever for her to dry my hair.
"i am new to houston and have been cutting my hair due to how expensive hair cuts are in this city. i decided to take a chance on great clips as it'd been fine in indiana when i was in a budget.today, i went to gc and was very displeased. first, i was greeted, barely, by an older gentleman. he ended up being the one to cut my hair...in 15 mins flat! isn't look twice, didn't wash it (even though it was very greasy), didn't ask how i parted my hair, nothing. he didn't even brush my hair all the way and was like ""done"". i thought maybe i was just going to need to brush it out and fix it a bit(no big for a $14 hair cut). when i got to my car, it was disheveled, the side swept bangs were not well cut and were blunted.i went back in and had to hold the pieces i wanted fixed, every time, how i wanted them to be cut and he still did not cut there! what?!left with greasy hair, funked up bangs, and the understanding of what women mean when they talk about the feeling of helplessness you get with a funked up cut. not something i want to feel again. that was a disgrace! i have no education in styling and do better cutting mine and my husband's hair than that man...who didn't even apologize and didn't seem surprised..."
"i normally go to the great clips location in oak forest but went here because i happened to be in the area. i asked the stylist for an 8 on top and 4 on the sides and back. unfortunately, the stylist disregarded my instructions and just cut it with scissors and seemed to just do what he thought was right. also, he was very aggressive with the clippers and it felt like someone was cutting into my skin. i won't be going back to this location again."
"decided to come here for my weekly cut and was really surprised. i tend to stay away from big chain places but i'm glad i stopped here. as soon as i walked in i was greeted and put on the waiting list. they offered me a magazine and a water, which i respectfully declined. i got my usual cut (high fade the sides and blend the top) and it was at its usual cleanliness. she kept a small conversion going but seemed bored lol. she was also a little rough when she would grab my head and when she was brushing the hair off my shoulders. still a great place for a good cut. will be returning soon!"
"great place!they accept walk-ins, give lollipops, and when your hair is brushed, it doesn't hurt! i will definitely come back here for future cuts. shoutout to chuck for being an awesome stylist!"
"i'm at great clips now, this is my second time visiting and i'm extremely frustrated. first time i visited i walked in and got taken care of right away and received great service, before leaving the stylist that helped me recommended i do an online reservation next time to avoid a wait. so now i'm here my second time, made my online reservation, waited the 40 min at home and then drove over. when i arrive i find out i still have to wait for two more people -_-.. what's the point of the online check in if customers still have to wait. disappointed"
"we love andrea!  i have been to others here but no one compares to andrea. she knows how to cut a toddler boy's hair and it's only $11.  can't beat her, here!"
"let me preface by saying that my rating is based on the stylist, specifically, and not on great clips. i've taken bradley to many places, but andrea has been our go-to when he needs a fresh fade. she listens and then takes her time to make sure we're  satisfied. i've used other people here, and it's been a disaster. i've never used them for my hair, nor has hubby, but andrea does an excellent job on bradley's hair."
"shocked at the low reviews here. i get a great haircut every time, never wait in a line to get it, and you can't argue with the price. they even have a few dedicated parking places. james is new, he just started cutting here today, and this is the best haircut i've had in years."
"checked in online and arrived to be next in line and they took someone that just walked in, never coming back."
"i was surprised by this location's level of service and quality of haircut for their prices ($13 for haircut, $5 for shampoo). after a few nightmare experiences at common haircut places like great clips or supercuts, i started getting haircuts at pricier salons.my first haircut here was back last year with janel, who was very attentive, careful, and thoughtful with my haircut (asking me whether the length, layers, etc.) were okay, which made me feel a lot better about how the haircut turned out.this week, i went back in and wasn't able to see janel since she was already with another customer, but latasha was just as awesome and my haircut looks great!i'm usually not too good at getting regular haircuts every 3 months or so (because of my past bad experiences), but now that i know i have two hairstylists i can trust, i'll definitely be coming here regularly!two quick recommendations: if you can check in online before you arrive, it should help you be seen quicker since they do not take appointments. they serve customers based on order of check-in (either in-person when you arrive or online).coming during off-peak hours is also a good idea too because this particular parking lot rarely has enough spaces with all the other businesses during busy times (e.g. 12 noon-5 pm on weekends)."
"so this is the place that i take my son bradley to get his haircut. he's only five so i can't justify paying for him at the place that i go to. i have tried a number of places and really didn't like them enough to keep coming back. i think the only reason we tried this place was because they sent us a coupon in the mail and it was down the street from my house. the first time i went, i had aundrea and i thought she did a good job. since she did a good job, i decided to bring him back but she wasn't working that day. i went ahead and let whoever was working cut his hair and they were horrible. after coming home and being real disappointed with the outcome i brought him back a day or 2 later for aundrea to fix it. luckily she was able to fix it. i'm giving them a 3 star review only because they won't let you put 3.5. i wouldn't really rate it a 4 but i would definitely give aundrea a 4 star but based on the business itself, i would have to say it's a 3.5 for me."
"yep you already know i'm yelpn'. i come to this salon every time i get a drastic hair cut. it doesn't happen often but when i do i go here because of what i thought was great customer service for such a good price. unfortunately that was not the case today. came in to get bangs done for the first time in 22 years, so kind of a special occasion. walked in no hello, then as i watch this customer thank his hirdresser for the great job she said nothing. he continued to thank her but nothing, not even eye contact. already put off, and if i'm put off by some hairdresser my ass ain't getting no hair cut. so funny stuff right here, she asks my name. i say brittany, she says, last name or first?? um...lol... my first, don't know many brittany's as a last name, look story short this ginger i think, april or something like that was horrible, just mad at life and wondering why she was cutting hair. the other hairdresser was smart to tell her to stop. poor man next to me was going to get his hair done by her, i told him good luck. $13 is $13. i'm not wasting my time or money on a shitty hairdresser. and one more thing, as someone who is in the restaurant industry constantly dealing with customers i know that if you want a repeat customer, you do everything you can to give that customer a great experience from beginning to end. some people have it and some don't."
"mixed feelings. i come here regularly because it's cheap and i just get a trim, no fancy styling. but when i've been sitting and waiting for half an hour before someone even comes to put my name on the list, and people keep walking in and getting helped immediately because they checked in online, you can imagine why i'd be a little frustrated. i'd be first in line if they'd acknowledge customers when they come in the door."
"i walked in and was seen in 5 minutes. i didn't check in online because i went on a whim. james was great! i guess i expected mediocre, but i received an excellent cut, style, and service over all. i usually go to a higher price salon, but i am just as happy with my cut and style from james. he is a gem!"
"very ridiculous when i am waiting for 15 mins and two people come in who ""checked in online"" get to be served before me. if the only requirement is to say ""yes"" to ""did you check in online"", then i'm going to say yes next time. i don't care if you checked in online, if i have been waiting for 15 mins, you should serve me first. common customer service."
"it's cheap and it's in the neighborhood, and for boys that's half the battle. this location is new (and they sweep your hair into a vacuum thing in the wall, how spiffy!) so i'm going to guess the slow service and computer issues are a new location issue. i still prefer sportsclips over at taylor/sawyer for my kiddo, but there's another option in the neighborhood now for a kid haircut."
"a very clean location. both stylist had a very nice, practical hairstyle that looked good on them. they both were working like busy bees since during lunch time they had a semi-rush. for some odd reason some   customer's walked in and kept on asking for a lady natasha whom i found out is the manager. i don't know her but i think she needs more practice in scheduling so she will not schedule only two stylist during lunch time. i felt bad for those two hardworking ladies."
"came here mainly because i'm lazy and its close/cheap. but i soon learned you get what you paid for. i've gotten 4 haircuts here and only 1 of them was what i would consider a ""good cut"". the rest were terrible. honestly, i almost told the woman to just buzz it all off cause she screwed up so bad. uneven blends and just overall bad. i was embarrassed after getting it cut and 3 weeks later it still looks bad. i will definitely go somewhere better next time and pay a little extra. trust me, don't go here unless you want to look like a doofus. luckily i already have a girlfriend and she's understanding. if not, i'd be more angry cause it'd limit my ability to pick up girls. avoid this place."
came here just to get my bangs cut a and fixed. they came out terribly. now i have to go to a wedding looking like an idiot. you expect people to know how to do their job correctly.
"went in to see adrianna not too long before closing hours towards the end of the month this past november.  i almost never leave reviews on yelp but i wanted to sign in and specifically post this as she gave me a fantastic haircut and we enjoyed some wonderful conversation.  she was a pretty big football fan and had to school me a bit on what was happening in the league!anyhow, i travel very frequently for work so i often have to get haircuts on the run in various cities around the country.  it was refreshing and honestly unexpected to have such tremendous service and quality from adrianna at this great clips location.  please do not hesitate to visit this location and get a cut from adrianna!!  a++++ service!"
"i have been to great clips before and had excellent experiences. i am trying to save money so i came in today because it's cheap. i showed the lady a picture of what i wanted and she did nothing like it. i wanted a bob about an inch above my shoulder. i showed her the picture, it's an easy cut. by the time she started cutting the front it was too late. what she gave me was a very short bob about an inch above my jaw line. it's the worst haircut i've ever had. i don't want to go anywhere or see anyone. i went in wanting a cute trendy haircut for summer and i came out looking like an overweight teenage boy from the 90s. there is nothing i can do to save it or make it look better. if i didn't want to pay for another haircut, i would just go and turn it into a pixie, at least then it would look a little better."
"absolutely terrible, she couldn't even manage to cut the hairs around my ears. there's long hairs scattered on the sides of my head. one side is longer then the other. my fault for going to such a cheap place. you get what you pay for."
i've had monique do my hair here many times in the past and it's always been great.
"before coming to this location, i used to go to fantastic sam's on 1960 and eldridge but then my favorite hairstylist left and so did my favorite hairstyle. now i have had a whole bunch of experiences from oh my god i feel like a million bucks to oh my god wtf happened to my hair! last time i went i got a haircute (yes, i wrote haircute) from matthew. excellent customer service, super hilarious, and oh yes - great haircut! he cut my hair exactly as i told him. if my haircut was based on just this one experience then this location would have five stars but unfortunately that is not the case.one time i came here and there was a guy who i have never seen before. i gave him clear directions on how to cut my hair but unfortunately he used the clippers all the way up to the middle of my head. i looked like i was back in high school and was going for the ""i got my hair cut so that i won't have to go get it cut for the next two months"" look. fortunately though he managed to make it all even and in the end it was not a totally awful experience.over all, really friendly staff and mostly great hairstylists."
"adriana at great clips did a great job cutting my daughter jade's hair. she took her time, and was very pleasant. thank you!"
"i haven't had a problem with my hair cuts here, but i am disappointed that i received a coupon on yelp when i checked in and they wouldn't honor it. nice job great clips."
"always such a great experience here,  i love it.  everyone is nice but best of all this place is the best haircut i've ever gotten.  and not pricey at all.  i would recommend this place to everyone in a heart beat."
"don't bother coming here.  i literally just got a haircut here, and i felt compelled to write a review.this lady named evelia cut my hair.  i just asked for a trim on the back and my sideburns, and that's what she literally did.  took all but three minutes.  went up to pay, and they charged me for a full haircut.  i was flabbergasted because all i wanted was a trim, and that's what i got.  still, she stood her ground and charged me $13 [they advertise $5 for a trim]  for 3 minutes of her time.  i'm furious about it, and i will never come back here again.  they rip you off and charge you for something more than what you asked for and received.so word of advice....1) never come here again because they will charge you for more than what you receive2) if for some reason you feel really passionate about coming to this particular great clips location, don't ask for evelia to be your stylist3) people that nickel and dime you like this should never receive anyone's business"
"nice barber shop. the barbers in there were very social, entertaining and professional. i'm so used to going  to a barber shop where the barbers talk amongst themselves and i'm just a number.. the barbers actually talk to the customers and seem to enjoy what they do.the quality of work was good. i got compliments on my hair."
great price and great haircut. plus it's super-fast!
"i usually go to great clips because its a decent price and haircut. i went to this location right before christmas and got a middle 20s girl as a haircutter, her name was kerstin or kirstin. she was on her phone more than half the time, appeared to be under the influence and slurring her words. she did a horrible job on my haircut and i let her know it was not the cut i asked for and she was directly rude back to me. i will never return and great clils needs to revise their hiring requirements."
"i started going to great clips a few years ago when i lived in michigan.  since then, i've been to several great clips salons in various part of the country.  i tried gc-ashford center after moving to the houston area and have been very impressed.  the staff is very nice and they've always done a great job with my hair.  i have never had to wait more than a few minutes to get in a chair and the stylists are usually very efficient with quick haircuts.  the price is extremely reasonable."
"i made my first visit to this salon back in july.  i was greeted as soon as i walked in and didn't have to wait long to get my hair cut.  i was very happy with the service and the quality of my hair cut.  the price is right and the service can't be beat.  if you're in the area, i would stop by."
"doesn't matter who you get to cut your hair here. they all will do you right.  if you don't want to wait , make sure you check in on line before coming."
omg... the best customer service and quality on their hairstylist. everyone on the salon have the same standards but tammy (the mgr ) is my girl... #1
"my first time going, didn't know you could check in before hand but it was still a quick wait. very happy with the way andrea cut my hair."
"as others have mentioned, use their app to check in ahead of time and avoid the wait.  i checked in on a busy day where the wait was over 45 minutes, and when i arrived 45 minutes later, i was attended to within 1 minute!"
"this is my first time here, and i loved it. i haven't been able to find a good hair salon ever since i moved to the us two years ago but kathy was a joy to work with. i will definitely be a frequent customer here."
"fast, friendly, fun for kids and great stylists, especially ms kathy! thank you all for your patience and consideration with our kids!"
"i checked in on the app, is easy and fast. when i arrived the lady was waiting for me. silvia did excellent!! i definitely go back"
great place to get haircut and shampoo or conditioning treatments. our family favorite salon!
"my daughter went to get a trim - just keep same style and trim layers.   when she came home and flat ironed it - we saw how bad it was.  choppy layers that don't even make any sense, random pieces of hair sticking out.  no way to fix it right now unless she goes really short and cuts off 3 inches.    i was very surprised because my  younger daughter has gone there and always had a good haircut and the older one went once too and was happy which is why she returned.  but won't be going back again."
it's a good place to have a quick haircut. most of the staff in the store are very friendly but there are some people who have attitude but if you're lucky you'll find a good one.they have a online check-in app make sure you do that so that you don't want to waste you time sitting in the saloon.
"very friendly! great customer service and attention to detail. i go here a lot to get my hair shampooed and styled and they always spend a lot of time and care on my hair. they don't rush at all, each and every single one has been really friendly . i complaints, i am very happy with this place!"
"my whole family uses this location.  great, friendly, hard working employees. you can check in through their app to speed up the process and decrease waiting time. highly recommended!"
"my kids begged me to go somewhere else for haircuts and they'll finally get their wish. i just received horrible customer service after giving them years of business. their stylist and haircuts provided are mediocre, not a quality cut. i went there mainly for convenience and it was cheap, always goes back to the old saying, ""you get what you pay for""."
only came here because i had a coupon and just got the worst haircut ever. i echo brian z's comment that the staff only cared about getting through as many haircuts as possible. i won't be back.
got hair cut by rosa she's super sweet and knows how to cut and style.  check in online it works wonders especially since i brought my 2 year old in. i didn't have to sit but for a couple seconds. very clean professional place.
"actually, the whole reason why i remember this place is because they greet everyone with ""hi welcome to great clips!"" i get exactly the service i need for a price i'm perfectly willing to pay. if i'm quiet, the staff is totally respectful of that. idle chit-chat really helps me connect with the staff. you know what? i'm completely content with my experience every single time i come here, even if there's a little bit of a wait."
"they always do a great job for my son.  i really needed a cut today, so i went today for myself.  dora did an excellent job on my cut! love it!! will be going back! thanks dora!"
"walking in i wasn't even greeted by the lady at the front desk like i normally am at any great clips location i visit no mater what state i'm in. the lady at the front didn't even ask if i've check in online or anything. if you ask me i think she was overwhelmed with the amount of people already there and people coming in the establishment. you can tell the lady had an attitude. when she asked me what i came in for i proceeded to tell her a hair wash. she asked me how long my hair was and if i needed a style. i said no, just a hair wash and finger blow dry (which is free) she then told me that they can't dry my hair all the way without charging me an extra $30. as confused as i was, thinking that every location was the same. she said that if i wanted a round brush dry or style she wound have to charge me an extra $30. i told her i just needed a wash and finger blow dry. this lady had a bad attitude. i don't know what crawled up her butt but this is clearly not good customer service. as i met my stylist, keisha, who by the way was super nice and very friendly, she helped make a change in my mood about this particular location shift to the brighter side. keisha was wonderful. she did a great job with my long hair and her scalp massage game is on point!!! lol! while i was talking with her i found out that the lady in the front was in fact the manager. tammy is her name. i couldn't believe that such a person in her position was so rude. ugh!!! anyway, keisha did half way dry my hair and she did show concern for my shirt being a little damp which she did dry with her blow dryer. all in all i rate this place a two stars. the people who work there seem nice but the manager should have better customer service and show show a better example for her co-workers that maybe one day they would become manager... just a nicer one."
"they're always very sweet here when we come in. my hubby checks in online whenever we're on our way to the salon, so there's never a wait when we walk in. they always remember us. very polite, very friendly, and very efficient when it comes to cutting hair."
"tammy is the best stylist!  knows exactly what you want from your description. very professional,  must ask for her when you come for an awesome haircut!"
"was nervous when i saw that all the hairdressers were women, but it turns out that a barbershop down the street had recently closed down and many men were coming into this great clips instead. my hairdresser (didn't get her name) was very patient, asked lots of questions and seemed dedicated to giving me exactly what i wanted. i'll be coming back!"
"i went in here the other day do one of their $6.99 cuts. i wanted a trim. she cut off 3 inches. i wanted a ""v"" not a ""u"" and she did that but she didn't make sure all the ends were matched up. it was a terrible experience. i cried when i got home. everything people say about great clips was confirmed. not going back. ever"
"got a chance to stop by this great clips location during their opening weekend and i am so glad i did. i thought great clips was mostly for men, but to my surprise they offer blowouts and my stylist was incredibly experienced and skilled with women's hair. i got a style done for a wedding i attended and was so happy with the quality, speed, and care of my stylist. i'll definitely be coming back for a cut or another blowout!"
"yadira cut my hair november 24, 2017 6:30pmshe did an amazing job!!!!she shampooed and conditioned my hair so well!!!!!! it smells soooooo good!!!!!!she trimmed my hair!!! i loved her technique. she was very professional. i was in and out she did such a good job!!!!!"
"i am so done with this place. i have been coming here for over a year but no more. they have this b*llsh*t system where you ""check in"" online and it tells you the wait... 15 minutes, 40 minutes, 90 minutes, whatever. i work very nearby so i can monitor when it gets down to 0 (zero) minutes and i check in and go. every freakin' time, it's not zero minutes. it's 10, or 15, 20 minutes. so infuriating, and completely unacceptable. typical corporate franchising nonsense. and then while you're waiting employees sweep up, use the restroom, fraternize... all with people waiting there like sheep. see ya' not-so-great clips."
"stop by to see yadira, one of the best at doing fades for sure. she takes the time to check your haircut and she can style it as you like it. it seems that she has years of experience doing men's haircuts. highly recommended!!check in is easy, i usually stop by around 8:00pm or so when there's hardly any people and there's no wait. premises are clean and easy parking up front."
"i went there to get my ends cut. i told the lady to only cut the ends because i am growing my hair. she literally chopped my hair. it took me a year and a half to grow it as long as i had it and in less than 5 minutes she chopped it. i am so mad about it. unfortunately i forgot the name of this person but someone that can't listen to what you are saying when it comes to cutting your hair, should not be working as a hair dresser."
"if anyone who is inspired by bangs on pinterest, don't go here. and if so please ask them if they know what ""fringe bangs"" are, if they say no never heard of it. leave. i should of known that first red flag. i am seriously disappointed, mostly because i consider $20 a lot for a damn haircut. anything over $20 is ridiculous unless the person has inches of hair that needs to be cut and styled. i went in the other day and asked the guy if i can get fringed bangs, he didn't know what it was called and i showed him a picture on pinterest. they were light longish bangs with a gradual length on the side if you want to put your hair up. he first grabbed a few pieces of my hair (another red flag) like wtf is that? i said can you get a little more? and i was hoping he would style the sides. he didnt. he probably didn't pay attention to the length of my bangs. he sprayed alot of water all over my hair, i got a cut for a trim on the layers (he barely touched them) and left me with damp messed up hair. soon as i got home, washed and dried. i was pissed that my hair still felt super dry that i had to come back and do the layers. but i should of asked someone to fix the bangs. when i posted an ig story, i got comments saying i should of gone somewhere to pay $60 for stupid bangs!! because i got what i paid for??? $20 should not mean leaving someone with a terrible cheap ass cut. it's supposed to be a professional salon! not a training beauty school. a friend said he butchered my hair and she can't do much and to wait it out. i can't believe this guy left me out of my chair looking like that. i wish i can get my partial refund back. one star for the girl who did the extra trim. please pay attention to the stylist if they aren't focused on your hair or needs. it may just be hair but it looks ridiculous and a waste of money. i really don't understand this industry when it comes to spending a fortune for a decent cut. and the bangs was really nothing hard to do for someone in his position. age and gender has nothing to do with it either. he's hardly anywhere near what i called old, he can keep up to trends and this is not a difficult one. i'm just so upset i have to deal with this for months to it grows back!!!"
"my boyfriend went in for a hair cut and he told the lady how he wanted it and when he came out, the back of his head was uneven and cut too short..not at all how he wanted it..he says he's never going back and wish he went somewhere else. don't recommend."
"got my cut today from angelica. i showed her a picture of how i wanted the cut and she went ahead and did her thing...totally different from what i  wanted.  asked her about using the scissors instead of the trimmer and she responds ""not this time"" !!! so what's the deal here??? a major disappointment and did not find her polite at all...$17 for a shitty haircut with rude behavior, never sitting in her booth again!"
"i always got my cut with kim when i have coupons in the mail.  as of october 2017 prices are 17 bucks for haircut.  coupons in mail give you 3 bucks off.  this review is for the torrance location at hawthorne and torrance blvd.  i like how the computer system already keeps my style profile in place and that i can check in online.  no more guessing games and walking out due to the barber being fully committed for the day! unlike some barbers expect to shower on your own to get rid of stuck hairs.  shampoo and wash is extra.  no such thing as razor shaves for the back unless if you pay extra.  photos were taken the day of the cut, 5 on top medium fade with 0 on side."
"recently, great clips started giving preferential treatment to customers who give them a higher tip. these days, it's always a long wait there. so when you go there ask for a particular stylist, they will say 10 or 20 min or will say 1 or 2 people ahead. when you sit and wait, they will call someone who just showed up. if you ask them, they would say the other person checked in online, but that person's name was not there in the check-in list (as per their computer screen). if you ask them, they would say, it's the system that shows the other person was ahead. you could clearly tell this is a false claim by monitoring the way that they try to manage. finally noticed the other person paid a way higher tip than usual tips. this clearly shows if you start paying a higher tip, you could cut the line."
went for a hair cut last week. very disappointed. feels like i didn't even get a hair cut. i think the lady was too into talking with other stylist than to put focus on cutting my hair. had asked for front layers and looks like she didn't even touch the front. bangs were still long and had to get one of my family members to touch it up after going in for my hair cut. what a waste of $20. defiantly won't be returning. san pedro location is better.
"recently i decided to cut off at least 4+ inches of my hair. mobile check in is a super cool feature! i typically spend almost $150 to $200 for a haircut. both my boyfriend's haircut, and my hair cut plus conditioning treatment came out so cheap and both of us loved out haircuts. we will be coming back for sure! great service, prices and haircuts! only downfall is that their parking lot can be a bit crazy during busy times"
"went for a small trim and i actually got that. everyone there is super nice, took the time to understand what i wanted when i said 1in  she cut 1in. i forgot her name started with a y, i would recommend anyone to this specific great clips."
"i have been coming here for over three years. i am a satisfied customer! i really like how karla cut my hair; i have seen it grow fast when she handles it. she's nice, won't rush. just one reason i gave them a 4 and not 5 is because they will try to sell you products but you can find these items elsewhere and cheaper! overall, i like it here."
"worst experience ever at this place. my 11 year old son literally got the worst verbal abuse ever by the lady veronica who cut his hair. for example when my son said he felt like a robot she came back with robots sit still better. also when hair got down his shirt she blamed him for taking his arm out of the apron and when she tried to pull his shirt out to blow dry it she yanked it telling him that he needs to let go in a rude manner. i have never in my life experienced a hair dresser that rude!!!! never will i return to this location again!!!! to add on my son hasn't had a hair cut in over a year because he grew it out to donate it and right off the back she said it wasn't long enough. i have the ponytails and when i got home i measured them and they were more than long enough. i honestly think this lady just doesn't like cutting kids hair. my daughter and i were taking pictures of the process not for youtube or social media but for his journey in life and memories and she asked him ""do you get recorded a lot?"" of course he said yes. she came back with a comment saying ""well i don't!"" it's the next day and i'm still upset about this experience."
"nice place to get hair cut. i've always come here to get my haircut. it's best if you check-in through their website to get an idea how long you wait before you are next. staff is friendly. i get buzz cut which is really simple for the employee to do. depending on the employee, when they cut my sideburns it's uneven or its cut too much. i wish they can be a little more cautious or caring when cutting hair so it's symmetrical"
i have been getting my haircut from yadira for 6 years now and i follow her wherever she goes. thank you for always giving me great haircuts and for introducing me to tapers. you are very friendly and very clean.
"ive had many great haircuts at this place. they are fairly inexpensive but do a high quality job. the manager is great, they are always very friendly and they work hard."
"i've been coming to great clips for the last 6 haircuts. so 5-6 month. i guess i got the luck of the draw my first time by getting greg to cut my hair. greg does a great job and he's a nice guy as well. the shop is busy, turn over is fast enough, it's clean, staff is always friendly and the price is right.if you don't want to wait the 10-30 minutes, download there mobile app and make a same day appt! just remember to set your appt within 15-20 minutes of your planned arrival!"
"my wife and i have been coming to this great clips for about a decade.  at some point in the first year or 3, johanna made an impression on us and became our regular stylist.she always does a good job shaping our heads and her fun and friendly personality just make it that much better.to be clear, everyone at great clips is great and we have used other stylists on those rare occasions when johanna was off and we simply had to get a cut right away.  always a good experience.as my household has grown a bit in the last few years, johanna remains our regular stylist and she now also does my little girl's hair, as well as my mom-in-law's hair."
"my husband said to give this place 5 stars.  he walked in with 8 people ahead of him and he was still back to the truck within 25 minutes!  fast service, and his hair looks pretty good!he'll definitely go back here!!!!yay!"
"my daughter got her first haircut today and everything went as smoothly as i could imagine. walked in, got called in right away, got a haircut by kimberly (who was lovely), and went about our day!location has plenty of parking at no cost. will go back soon!"
reason why i chose to use this barber shop is for convenience of closeness to home and making appointment for prompt service. i made an appointment on line and the waiting time was 59 min. i got to barber shop on my 50th min. and the one lady barber was doing hair on a woman and another lady waiting on a chair for her turn. my name was next to the lady waiting on a chair. that means that i have to wait for another 1/2 hour or more. told the lady barber that their on line appointment is not accurate and i left and went elsewhere to get a haircut.
"came in here a few days ago, the short lady and yes i said short, i'll explain why, who cut my hair had the nerve to make me slide down on the chair  so that she could reach the top of my head to cut my hair, rather than pressing the lever to lower the chair like what everybody else does there, to reach the top part of my hair.this lady needs extra training. since she realized that she was struggling with me she laughed at me and didn't say excuse me or anything, so unprofessional. most likely i will not be returning to this salon."
"they did not do a good job.  i showed the lady a picture of a lob and she said she could do it.   it turned out very choppy/uneven.  if the stylist didn't know how to layer, she should have admitted it!  so disappointing.  i got what i paid for since i was desperate for a cut, so i'm not mad.  but great clips should build a better reputation for themselves by setting standards and by hiring people who don't just practice cutting hair for dolls!  now i have to go to ulta in the same plaza to have them fix it hahaha"
"really bad customer service. they've always had two particular employees with a really bad attitude, i don't know their names. i was a long time customer but i left because of the service, today i came back hoping they improved or the employees not there but they're still there with the same terrible customer service."
i've been growing out my hair and this has been the process of how it looks thanks to nisha. she's amazing. so happy my hair is getting long. it looks fabulous with the products that this location has to offer.
jus had my hair cut. quick and jus what i wanted. selena. the one.with the nice eyes did a good job
"wow.  this used to be a great place to get family haircuts. friendly stylists who took pride in their work and made you feel welcome. not anymore. under the leadership of temmika, this place has gone downhill.  zombie like greeting when you walk in.  they all seem annoyed to have clients.  temmika yelled at both of us during our kids haircuts.  at separate times, our kids has asked us a question so we stepped closer to answer.  temmika shouted across the salon that we couldn't stand there. the stylist could have told us, but temmika had to make a big deal in front of everyone.  it felt like the dmv.  we have 2 kids. neither stylist was pleasant to the kids.  overall, won't ever come back. there are better places to get your hair cut.  avoid temmika and her rude crew."
"got my haircut today from quinisha!    she was fantastic.  she was super thorough, talented, courteous.  i've been coming to his place for a while and they're all great, but quinisha stands out! couldn't ask for more. i will be sure to request her again!  couldn't be happier."
"worst hairstylist ever! this location is so close to my house it's easy and tempting to stop by . the few times i have ,i have regret it so much. every stylist in this location have cut my boys hair and they do a terrible job. on even hairs, marks of the blades . i had to go in once a second time just to get them to fix it. and they where outraged . but you could clearly see there mistakes . i'm not a hairstylist but i could see all their mistakes. this last time the guy took 40 min cutting my sons hair . at the end he didn't cut it like i asked for . the right side was higher then the left side. and the left side you couldn't even see the fade it was more like ""0"" and then all of a sudden boom there's hair ,straight into like a number 6. man will know what i'm talking about . my son does his hair to the side so you could imagen it"
i've been a regular customer here for a while. been through a couple of stylist and the one i enjoy the most is selena. she's very good and has a good eye. it's usually clean and don't really have to wait too long with the online checking in.
this place doesn't have wifi so that's the only draw back ... feels like an updated super cuts
had a disturbing interaction with the he-she that works there.very very rude while one of the prettiest girls there was so sweet.too bad
"i have taken my son there more i would like to admit. i did go back repeatedly in hopes to get this one lady that had the best attitude as well as knew exactly what i wanted, i don't think she works there anymore, she is the only reason i'm giving this place two stars. sadly, he was stuck with others that did hack up jobs, aka uneven, hair in the back standing up because it was cut way too much. oh and their attitudes suck, listen to the other people that have stated the same. sorry that we bothered to come in for service, the last time i told the lady flat out (after her poor haircutting skills botched my kids head up again) i will never be back and i am definitely sticking to that word. don't waste your time or your money here, maybe re-training would be helpful. even some customer service classes may do this place justice."
"great clips is a hit or miss.of course, that depends on the person who is cutting your hair. they don't take appointments and you don't know who's working unless you call ahead of time. their staff schedule changes so it's kinda inconsistent.you do have the option of waiting for your stylist to be free. and i do like they save notes of your last hair cut. however, the numbers doesn't mean you'll have a 'great clip'the online check in system is odd --but i do like that you have an idea of how long you have to wait before you get to the store. maybe eventually, they should add their stylist schedule to the app.there is a loyalty program, which is 10 hair cuts = a free one.parking is always available, it's on the 3rd floor of the midtown plaza next to gnc and pizza rev.i really like niesha. she knows what's she's doing.i liked michael - but he no longer works there.i also liked xxx (i forgot her name) but she's a manager that is helping to open the glendale store.i usually go to ulta after my haircut --but that has nothing to do with this review.$16 for adults if you are wondering."
"will never come here again, it's funny how the owner of this place will offer u a coupon for a free hair cut for you next visit when they have already fucked up ones, ...  came in just to cut the sides and and trim the top, and i walked out bald.... don't come here employees look all tired and don't know what there doing"
"i came in today with pretty realistic expectations, knowing that i was at great clips and with a coupon from ralphs. as many say, you take a risk with budget haircuts. my stylist was a young woman with pink in her hair. i had arrived within an hour of closing, and the wait list was stacking up. she hurried me into my seat, asking me what i wanted before i even sat down.  i came in asking for an even cut, just to take off length (no layers, etc - just a straight cut). i usually have long hair but am not afraid of taking off 6+ inches at a time since shorter cuts usually gives me more time in-between salon visits. i showed her an approximate length to remove with my hands (8-10 inches) and apologized in advance for my hair, which was a wet and tangled mess from the pool. 1. she did not even bother to fully comb out my hair. she briefly whipped a comb through my hair, but there were still tangles and knots. to give some context, my hair looked ""wavy"" and yet i have pin-straight hair normally. 2. when she reached a particularly difficult knot, she flat out told me, ""you have a really bad knot. i don't know what you want me to do about it. you'll have to deal with it later."" 3. she hacked a chunk off my hair and started matching the length around the rest of my head. she was done in less than five minutes and handed me a mirror to approve. when i questioned the length being even, she then went back for another ten minutes actually double-checking her work (which i noticed she had never done) and even confessing, ""oh yeah, some parts were longer than others."" more snips, snips, snips to even everything out. 4. about halfway through the appointment she tells me, ""sorry. i forgot to ask you if you like having your hair parted on the side or in the middle. if you want your hair parted in the middle, i have to go back and fix the lengths again because i already cut with a side parting."" now, i really was fine with the side part which is why i did not say anything in the beginning, but i really did not trust her ability to tell if things were even - and a middle part just seemed simpler to tell symmetry. more snips, snips, snips. 5. at the end, i could still see uneven edges. she had already hacked off 30% more length than i wanted trying to ""fix"" all the uneven lengths. i was not willing to let her keep trying and leave me with nothing at all. i am now at home with a cut way shorter than i wanted and am terribly upset. pay the $10-15 extra dollars and go to fantastic sams. avoid the risk of this place."
"i got a haircut from the short hispanic lady. i'm a nice person and i was nothing but polite to her but she was so angry for some reason. she had all this pent up rage built up and took it out on me. she asked what i wanted to do to the back of my hair, ""clip or buzz"" i replied, saying i didn't know because for almost all my life i've had long hair and short hair was a new thing for me. i chose to clip.after that, i looked at it and saw it was still a little too long, so i asked if she could buzz it. she proceeded to get visibly angry but then starting buzzing the back of my neck. as a kid, i've gotten buzzcuts before and i know it doesn't take that long. she buzzed the back of my neck so much that it was soooo painful and the next day, i woke up with blood on my pillow. she must've just been buzzing skin because even i knew it shouldn't have taken that long.after that, it still looked a little funky so i asked if she could kind of fade it going up. she responded with ""first you want me to clip it, so i clipped it. then you wanted me to buzz it?? when is this going to end? i don't know what you want!""yes, she yelled at me in front of everyone over a harmless question. i replied with ""sorry, it's okay you don't have fade it then"" i'm really not sure what her problem was. she had so much rage hidden within her lmao. and on top of that she gave me one of the worst haircuts i've ever had if the person who gave me that awful haircut/bloody neck is reading this, i just wanna know why you were so angry that day lmaoo."
"the managers are very rude !! my boyfriend was there yesterday and he said the person that was in charge i believe his name is william shouted at the employees then took one of them in the office leaving a client in the chair and you can clearly hear the yelling , so unprofessional made my boyfriend feel uncomfortable in this salon and every time we go there we get rushed out . bad customer servic! they always have new people working there every time we go  maybe because of the managers bad attitude toward them. the other day  tameka the manager yelled at some clients because they were standing close to the stylist chair. very very rude !  i would give 0 star if i can"
"well i just got here and i can already tell you the customer service is pretty lousy.i checked in through yelp a few hours ago, and when i entered i was asked whether i checked in, so i replied yes. the hair stylist said their online system doesn't work sometimes so i should check in again through their web site. i asked ""if online isn't working, can i can check in in-person?"" which was ignored. so now i get to wait after three other people with no real apology, least of all acknowledgement.totally understood online systems sometimes don't work, but don't (1) not ask more details about the appointment i tried to make, or (2) ignore your customers. guess gc doesn't want my business!update: pretty good and efficient haircut. during my haircut though, one of the stylists was talking about the guests (including myself) in spanish, i guess assuming that we wouldn't understand."
"we came here simply because we did not want to wait at our usual barber shop.....i can honestly tell you, we are sold! the service we got was exceptional & the our hair looks fantastic (pic)we clearly found our new spot.sorry, ian we didn't come while you were still here!"
"i called this location and asked for today's availability.  the woman asked me to hold for a minute... when she came back on the line she said ""yes?""  i said ""yes?"" ""can i help you?"" she asked. ""you ask me to hold...?"" i responded. then i can't believe it when she tells me, ""whoa, calm down. this isn't the same person you talked to before.""seriously?? if they can't even handle a phone call, i doubt they can perform a haircut."
"i've been a client of great clips for a few years now unfortunately my usual salon got closed down. i checked in online and my wait went past 30 min the check in time. totally understandable if there was a big crowd but this was not the case. there was one worker standing by the register gossiping distracting the others cutting clients hair, supper annoying. after 30 or so min my son got called. he has never complained about a haircut in his life but this day he asked to never take him back. unfortunately this person has no experience with the tools she cut the back of his ear and lower neck, and quickly blamed it on him. she also didn't clean up his lower back line which is common when getting a fade. now i get kids move around but in his 8 years no one has cut him while cutting his hair. i will definitely no come back they sure lost a potential client.."
very good and patience with children.nancy was very good with my son who has a fear of getting his haircut. he was very happy
i usually never leave reviews but i've been coming here for quite some time now. i've always gone with denise & she's amazing! if you want somewhere where they have good customer service and know what they are doing come here! ask for denise and you won't disappointed.
"for thos guys who like to get half on the sides with a nice blend, do not go with shirley! she is horrible when it comes to that. she not only cut too much, but she does not know how to blend.  damn!!! very unhappy with my haircut.this will be the last time i go there because of this bad experience."
"my son loves here to come get his haircuts. he has such a way if style and i love the fact that they save the information from the previous time so all i have to say is "" yup the same as last time "" lol so much easier . also i recommend you to download their app so you can check in before you get there so your wait won't be long."
"i hadn't cut my hair in years due to salons attempting to pressure me into doing something i don't want + trying to upsell to something i don't need. today i had the pleasure of getting my hair cut by the stylist carla. she did a great job, made the experience extremely comfortable and quick, i felt at ease! i will definitely be back due to her outstanding customer service and have already recommended her to others."
"came in today to see veronica for an overdue haircut. she's been cutting my hair for years, and is the only person who understands what i want without having to say much. i've gone through multiple hair styles with her, including long layers way past my shoulder blades, a-line bobs, and my current pixie with my mini taper fade. i've loved them all. i know i can always count on her for new styles, or just a simple clean up. thanks for always keeping me lookin' fabulous!!"
"young and beautiful women at great clips the women put in work. i got a taper fade ""0"" both my son and i got our hair cuts here. my son got a lollipop and a sticker. that's better then a dumb ballon from supercuts great clips is where the clips are great. denise: gets down with the clippers"
they are awesome! the ladies there are super nice and make you feel at home. denise was amazing!! i'm super cautious about my hair and she made everything just perfect i usually doubt my hair after i leave but i felt pretty and had no doubt whatsoever!! thank you denise you are perfect!! don't go anywhere!!
this place is a joke..the two ladies especially the older hispanic lady were both condescending. the older hispanic lady doesn't know how to do a basic cut and booted me out of her chair and the other lady had to finish her job..pathetic..will never go back to this place again
i haven't had a bad haircut here since i started coming monthly since 2016. every stylist is easy to talk to when you have questions or want to change something up. recently i brought in a picture and had flor and she made an even better version on me.
"very pleased with my haircut, denise is amazing she's been doing my hair for 8 years now and i literally trust no one else with my hair! she knows exactly what i want and doesn't get scissor happy when she sees long hair like other salons i've been to. definitely coming back when it's time for a trim!"
"quick cut for my boys. you can check in online which i love. service is always fast and friendly. nice selection of hair products, too."
i tried to go to the nearby great clips but found they were closed. i called this location because i knew i would be cutting it close and didn't want to inconvenience them. they told me they would take me if i got there before 9pm. i rushed to their location and got there at 8:58pm. they were locked up and refused service. horrible customer service.
"i just got my hair cut here today. the worst hair cut i've ever had. she messed up my hair so bad. i showed her a picture of what i wanted. simple layers. it isn't even and looks horrible. i'm a teenage girl, i'm going to get made fun of so hard because of my haircut. don't come here, it isn't worth it."
"definitely would rather pay $60 for a decent haircut then $15 for a sloppy job.as usual, they didn't listen to what i wanted but instead what they want. i only wanted my ends to be cut to minimum and she assured me ""only the tips and minimum "" even showed me how much she was going to cut.. well at the end she said i took all the ends off and i came home to more then one and half inches off and one side was shorter then the other. i wear clip in extensions so now i can't due to how awful the cut is.. my friend and i will definitely not return. nor i will recommend this place. don't want my money back. i will have to wait for my hair to grow and go to a real hairstylist!"
"i just want to let everyone know that i recommend verónica, she is such a great stylist! she gave me the best haircut, wash and blow dry. she knows exactly what she's doing and listens to what you ask for. thank you veronica for making me feel beautiful!"
"got my haircut by veronica, i've had my hair cut by her before and she always does a great job. never disappoints me and always exceeds my expectations!"
"service : quick stop for a haircut, the lady who cut my hair is awesome.i loved my hair! she's very detailed with what i want.note: you need to log in on th website to be able to check in and be on the list. it will show you how long is the wait. is close by costco too.price: $15 haircut  parking: street or parking lot"
"i went in with my friend to get a hair cut. my friend supposed to have a bob style hair cut and i just needed my bang cut. my person still works on my bang but my friend hair cut was done.i was chocked. i look at my friend's hair and it was a sloppy work. some of her strands are more than a centimeter longer than the others.we had to walk back to get it fix by someone else. still, both of the stylists did not shave the back of her neck! these people give great clips a bad name!i was gonna no star but i gave two for mine since i have no complaint for mine."
"i love great clips and i love that this location opened close to home. i went in the staff was friendly and location was clean. i met my new stylist, maria f. she totally understands my hair and my needs. i have been to see her about 4 times now and i love my hair!!! she's definitely a character, but that's what makes her great! doesn't hurt that she's an awesome stylist too"
"i've been here several times since this location opened last year.  the parking is hell on earth, because it's in the same plaza as the costco, but you don't have to wait if you check in online ahead of time!  i remember coming in on a busy weekend, and there were at least 4-5 people waiting, putting their names down.  i walked right up and was seated in a salon chair first, because my name was on the online check in, #1 spot!  all the other people in the waiting area gave me the wtf looks, ha.every member of my immediate family has been here, and it's a decent job each time for the price.  the best part, i got a ton of coupons for 2017 last year- for $9.99 cuts.   i handed them out to my friends like candy, and two of my friends used them.i usually see two, older ladies working when i'm there.  they are nice and do a decent job.  one time, a patron was mumbling and acting like an asshole to the cashier, i stared him down and ending up tipping the nice stylist extra because some people can just be mean unnecessarily."
"good cuts for kids. no waiting this sunday morning. denise and maria did a great job. this place is only for haircuts. so make sure you know what you want. bring a photo or take a photo on your phone-is highly suggested. i was looking for may as she is the best, but call ahead to find out her schedule. all in all the girls are fine."
"i came in after work for a bang trim and maria was the one to cut my hair when she was going to call out my name, she looked at my name all weird like a substitute teacher taking role and scared to mess up a students name. i mean you don't hear the name season a lot but still i am your customer and you have the nerve to criticize my parents for giving me a unique name instead of ""any other generic name"". when i told her i wanted a bang trim she acted like it was a hassle and that she won't that much money on me. when she thinned out my bangs she used the thinning scissors way to high up to the point that i have short hairs fraying out of my bangs! how hard can you mess up a bang trim?! if you had a bad day lady you shouldn't take it out on your customers."
this used to be fantastic sam's. i left when they closed down and my hairstylist left and that is mei. but she is back. she is very popular because she knows how to cut asian heads with hair.
i am kind of glad i walked out when i did the staff is rude especially the elderly lady maria. yelling at her co worker i felt uneasy being in there and so i left i told her i had signed in but was leaving bc all i wanted was a simple trim and she gave me a dirty look didn't even say anything. not going back never! guess it was a sign
"the place is great but staff is very rude and unprofessional especially her name is ""maria"""
"my new go to hair stylist is selena. so i came here after the holidays since i was in the area shopping and thankfully was quickly seated with selena for a haircut. usually i'm super basic and just get the clippers shortening my hair to a length i'm used to and have rocked that style for 90% of my life and mentioned that i was looking for a new look but had no idea what to even attempt. i told selena ""i'm trusting you to make me attractive"" and she gave me a fade which is a style i've never considered. thanks and i'll be back!"
"cheap prices like supercuts but way worse results. i'm not ageist but i knew i was in trouble when i walked in and it was just 3 older ladies waiting for their next victim. and for a place with no other customers i have no idea why the one that took me was in such a rush. 5 minute haircut with no exaggeration. snip snip snip and then she basically pushed me out of the chair. no fine tuning, no offer for product just a ""you're done, get out"". she also called me hairy which was odd. yeah i have hair and want it cut but i don't think anybody else has ever described me as hairy."
maria - very rude to her customers and co-workers. avoid at all costs!i'm going to call ahead to see who is working whenever i need a haircut.
wow! unable to follow directions on the hair cut. both of my boys had to sit back down with different people to get the hair cut we verbally requested. if there was a negative -1 i would leave that. smh
"i actually hate this location so much. i've been going to great clips for about 2 years now, going to a riverside location and back here when i'm in the area. this one is horrible. i've been here 3 times and 2/3 times, i've had the worst haircuts of my life. my first mess up here, they were nice and all, but my chair was flipped around the whole entirety of my haircut. when she finished (cannot recall her name), i was practically bald on the sides of my head. that was her definition of a ""fade"". i didn't bother reviewing even then but fast forward to today, i was furious. i got cared for extremely fast, but the lady, ""maria"", had such a horrible attitude. she was a carefree older woman, but did not let me finish talking. she prompted to ask about my sides and i tried telling her what i wanted overall and she cut me off 3 times, ""only the sides"". i would try to continue but she would repeatedly shush me. i am an extremely patient guy but also very anxious with all the bad hair cuts i've gotten in my life. maria is extremely rough and careless with her close cut razor and when she cut my ear, i said ow pretty loud but she just ignored me. i wanted to cut the top but at that point, i did not even trust her anymore. i told her really short on the top but she prompted that she had it under control. moreover, at the end, she scratched up my neck even worst than my ears. my haircut overall was extremely amateur and i am so dissapointed in this establishment. i don't get why this place hires such horrible people."
"i rarely decide to write bad reviews, but this time i wanted to write one almost right away. i went last sunday to get my hair cut, from long length to shoulder length, bob alike, with layers in the back. the man who was doing my hair seemed ok, no problems with anything. he seemed knowledgeable. i had thought to myself that a man will probably make my hair look horrible, but i gave him a chance. so when he was done, my hair was still wet, and it looked great. i was happy. i didn't do much with it the rest of the day, let it dry. today in the morning, when i was styling it, i took a mirror and when i saw the back of my hair i almost dropped the mirror. he simply cut a ""lawyer"" of my hair horizontally two inches from the bottom from right to left. it looked like a huge step from one ""layer"" to the second one. there was so layers! it was a mess, butchered, and cut stupidly. my 5 month old would have done a better job! i had one a meeting at my job today and i tried not to turn backwards to anyone, so embarrassing. during my lunch i went to my hairstylist, and she fixed it the best possible. it still looks kinda off, but much muuuuuuch better. so....if you go there don't expect too much, and try to have a lady cut your hair. i'm really mad, and i'm considering calling my bank to dispute the payment."
"i will preface this review with the usual, your miles may vary... i've been to several super cuts and also fantastic sams before... great clips is the newer chain that i finally tried out. for the most part, i've had okay to good experiences to most of these chains. i have had a few really bad experiences... but keep in mind that can happen with any type of business experience. i don't fault these types of places because they serve a niche... but you can sometimes truly say ""you get what you pay for..."" at least there is more a chance of that at places like this because you generally will see newer stylists with a whole lot less experience. and you typically may pay more for those that have more experience. that statement isn't 100% since sometimes i've had great experiences and haircuts from stylists at super cuts and felt it was a better haircut than the fancier more expensive (almost twice as much) places i've gone to as well. i generally pick to go to places like this because i didn't have time to go to my regular person and just want something quick and affordable. my hair is always cut short and it's pretty simple imho.in general, this place is well kept. very new looking, and clean. the shopping center shares a parking lot with costco alhambra... and to be honest, the parking here is probably some of the worst in la county. so definitely not convenient during costco hours. i came around 7:30 pm, so i did manage to find a parking spot right out front. there were only 2 people stylists when i got there. i did like that you could check-in online and i got a discount on the visit... when i got there, i had a tickle in my throat and had a coughing fit. the lady who cut my hair offered me a bottle of water, so if not for that and the discounted haircut, i probably would have given a 2.5 star for this stylist. she was really nice and the bottle of water showed good customer service, but that can only cover so much of a lack of experience or ability. as i mentioned, there was another stylist providing a haircut already when i arrived... so i assume that maybe he was halfway done? well, i love a quick haircut... but i was done with my haircut had her wash my hair (paid and was out the door) and the other stylist was still not done with the other gentleman's haircut. so perhaps that tells you something... i basically told the woman that i wanted about a 2 on the sides and back... which basically meant i just wanted a trim. i sometimes have gone short like a 1 or 1.5 with a fade, but when i try new stylists, i play it safe and don't go too short until i know they know what they are doing. by the time i was done, i knew my hair wasn't cut evenly. when she stopped to show me her work, she ran her hands through my hair to check the levels... and there were obvious areas that were way off in terms of length. lol. she did correct that, but thankfully she didn't try too hard to compensate because it could have gotten way worse. luckily my hair is styled in a way that can hide the poor haircut... at least until it starts to grow out and get long... then it becomes more obvious. the lady was on the shorter side... and i'm 6'... so she might have had a harder time seeing the top of my head if i'm sitting... but if she was having difficulty she could have asked me to slouch down to make it easier for her...anyway... the experience will get a 3 star... but i likely would avoid this place in the future... if i was really desperate to go back, i would wait for someone else besides the lady. i wish i could recall her name in case some of you are wondering who to avoid... granted perhaps you would have a better experience then me or over time, maybe she will improve, but i won't be 'chancing it' again... when you play russian roulette with your hair, you might as well try someone else next time..."
"i just got my hair cut here again today because i had such a good experience here the last time and the price is good. today's experience was, unfortunately, not as good. the person who cut my hair was heidi. when i got home i noticed that there was a piece of hair that was still long so i had to trim it myself. one side of my hair is also longer than the other side. good thing i always wear my hair in a ponytail so it won't be noticeable. i think i will be going to a different place next time or ask for mollie instead if she's there."
"oh man. went for a trim on my long layers. the lady had no idea what she was doing. they're serious when they say ""you get what you pay for"". first the two ladies took 5 minutes in how to spell my name for the check in. they finally asked me to write it in a post it. she sat me down and i showed her a picture...i've never had uneven layers...not to mention the way she cut my layers...it was tugging on my hair and i just felt split ends galore! i'll never go here again. i miss the old fantastic sams :( also i noticed they don't have their licenses in cosmetology posted like most hair places. i should of known better than to sit down!! :( on a good note the little asian lady was nice but she kept asking me how to cut my hair when i was trusting her as the stylist to know what to do. now i gotta go pay to fix what she did. i guess i'll be getting a real haircut for 5x the price..."
"had an awful experience today. went in for a trim and to just clean up the sides. maria checked me in. marlene did a terrible job with the trim. she cut way too much off all around, used the clippers and buzzed the sides so short my scalp shows. now my hair is oddly shaped, sticks out in the wrong places and is cut at different lengths. she doesn't know how to cut hair. she said she cut it the way ""she"" thinks looks good, not how i wanted it. never ever will i send anyone else to this salon. i asked her to contact the manager (heidi?) so i may speak with her and she refused. marlene should not be cutting hair. there was so much more wrong with marlene and what she was saying that the other employee who checked me in was there shaking her head too and agreeing with me."
don't go here! they do not know how to cut hair! i'd give them no stars if i could! we went there for a simple fade and they got all pissy when we told them we didn't like it. they gave my bf the worst haircut ever. i mean you're not supposed to see a like in the hair!
i want to give a shout out to marlita at the rancho marketplace great clips. she is by far the best stylist that has ever cut my hair and trimmed my beard. marlita is a true professional stylist. i highly recommend her.
"no rating!  a big ""0""!  i went there this weekend to have a trim!  i have a picture of how i want my hair trim!  jennifer was the one who chopped my shoulder length hair!  it was so short that i could've do a pony tail especially when i workout at the gym!  i was in tears when i got home!  will never go to this place again!  jennifer should be fired!!!! !"
"i really wish i could give them a good review. they are affordable, friendly and clean. but they didn't just do an average job on my son's hair, they butchered it. it was worse than i could do, and i am a terrible hair cutter. the fella who cut my son's hair was incredibly nice and tried his best... but it was so bad i had to go to another barber for cleanup. we will not be returning."
"i finally got the app to check in online as some customers got in ahead of me and suggested i do that. it really didn't help. it was the equivalent of walking in. it is also difficult to get any kind of discount (they had coupons and saturday specials the first few months they opened at burbank rancho) and even offered a discount when checking in using the app. all gone now. i found a val pack coupon online and they gave me a ""pass"" to use it. i waited a long time"
i checked in online saturday afternoon and only had a short wait when i arrived at the location. marlita did an exceptional job on my hair. i'm in the midst of growing out a pixie cut and she talked through some options with me that would let me keep sone length while giving me a cute cut that looks great. she was knowledgeable about the different options and how the whole cut would come together; she asked a lot of questions to get an idea of what i wanted before she started cutting and checked in throughout the cut to make sure it was shaping up as i had in mind. i was only visiting the area and don't know when i'll be back but i'd gladly go to her again.
"i recently moved to los angeles, and had been looking for a good place to get my hair cut. normally i go to a barbershop back home that does a good job, but when i am strapped for cash i go to great clips. i don't expect great work from them, but for $16 plus tip i expect to at least get some kind of good cut... this did not happen. the barber (leaving his name out of this, because he is a good guy, but bad barber) used the clippers on the top of my head first, and then proceeded to just move it about my head. at this point, it was better to just let him finish, but there was nothing he did that i couldn't have done better. it's safe to say that i got butchered, and i will never be going to another chain barbershop again."
"beyond upset with my hair cut. they butchered it :'''(   my hair looks like repunzels hair after that guy chops it all off :/  and why is the front longer then the back??  that's what i get for being cheap.  only when here cuz i had a coupon.  oh oh and on top of that, i was telling the lady how i wanted my hair and she was telling me no and i should do blah blah because blah blah!! nope nope never again.  i have to go get it fixed but i'm scared :( traumatized for life."
"i have been here three times. the first time one of my best haircuts in awhile from the very talented black woman who works there. the second time an older (asian?) man who was very rough and nicked me several times. tonight i went there and had the same asian man. i was hesitant to ask for someone else but i decided to try him again. ouch. not only he was rough, but now i have several huge cuts on my neck that hurt and look awful. i'm 42, never have i been cut so bad.. this guy needs to go back to school. ouch. beware."
"i walked in an hour before closing time (they close at 9pm). i was hurried over by an asian fella (recto, i believe his name is) who seemed nice. turns out, i picked the wrong fella and time to have my hair cut and show up because he ruined the little bit of hair i have. my advice to anyone else is skip this fella, he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to working with clippers."
my wife and i just had our hair cut here for the first time and couldn't be more happy. i suggest doing the online check in because we were put next in line upon arrival.
"all i have to say is... marlita, marlita... marlita!! i have been to many many salons and barbers around burbank, including floyd's.. and no one listens or can get anything right!  until... marlita. i just stopped in on a whim the day they opened. she not only listens, but she talks you through the entire cut to make absolutely sure that you are getting what you want. great personality and very professional. everyone at this location seems very nice, but marlita is the one to go to. now, not only do i have a new stylist... but so does my brother, my nephew, my niece and my mom. so yes, she is a pro at cutting and styling both men and women at a price that for sure would be a whole lot more elsewhere!"
"to cut very long hair, salons in the area are priced at $55 to $105. usually, i'd get a groupon and wait a week to get an appointment for cheaper, with someone who isn't great at communicating (or enthusiastic for groupon customers.)so, i decided to try the newly constructed great clips in burbank, and i ended up with a salon-quality haircut for $16! the best part was the wait time--about 5 minutes on a saturday afternoon. catrina is the very friendly and talented stylist who took genuine care in delivering exactly what i'd imagined. i would go here before everyone else discovers this gem! you can always check in online or use their app to reserve a spot ahead of other walk-ins."
"no good. beginner level cutting. not worth the $8.99 price. lack customer service skills, unprofessional and unpleasant attitude, and most importantly sad haircut."
"i got a coupon for $9.99 haircut so i decided to try them out. i only needed a trim this time. i like that they have an online check in option which also shows the wait time, there was parking, and it wasn't crowded when i showed up. they saw me right away, i'm happy with my trim, and they honored my coupon. the inside was clean and they had colorful partitions between the salon seats. they are also offers for veterans on veterans day which is nice. i was served by jennifer who was great."
go to marlita...she's laid back and listens...she communicates what she's working with before she does it.  i got a coupon and booked online and i was in and out...i dislike haircuts but this was painless
"first time going to this location and horrible customer service!!! my family and i walked in and no one acknowledged us and didn't check us in for good 10-15 mins. then the lady (jennifer) who took us had no exp of dealing with customers, she was rude, i was giving her description of what type of haircut and she literally walked away while i was still talking. i was dumbfounded that she actually walked away to the back while i was standing there talking. when she got back and i confronted her about how rude it was what she did, jennifer replied "" well i ashtray got what type of haircut you need"", really!!!! reverse the roles how the hell would you feel if i have you that type of customer service. my family and i are never coming back to this place just for the fact of what type of treatment we got as customers. sad part is the haircut was great but i believe in service especially when i was respectful and move and did not deserve this from her. maybe she is nice to only certain type of ppl and myself and my family didn't fit the criteria. horrible customer service...."
when i walked in a man named oscar began to cut my hair. well lets just say it was bad. and then proceeded to talk bad about my mom who was telling him what he did wrong. i am 15 he should not be saying stuff like that to me. but then a girl named jenifer fixed it and was very nice to us which made the experience a lot better!  after that as we were walking out oscar apologized which made the experience a little better.
"we told the stylist to cut our child's hair a certain way and he just butchered it!  it was like he wasn't listening to what we wanted...he had a set way in his mind the way it should look like and just went with it.  however, i reached out to the owner, who invited me back to have the haircut redone.  the second time around was much better...but i should not have to return to a place to have a mistake re-done!  they should get it right the first time...that is just plain common sense and professionalism."
"i'm not a fan of these timed haircut chop shops! i have  spontaneously & mistakingly been to 3 great clips in the area in the past 16 mos, if i see there is no wait.    ** 1st) they never use a neck strip between you & the apron they have used on dozens of customers w/warts, moles, blisters, boils,scabs, etc.. they are spreading highly contagious crap! ( if you don't believe me, feel the back of your neck or your significant other or son!! guys, where do you think those bumps came from??!!??!!  this is unsanitary and illegal, please report them to the cal state board of cosmetology or barbering immediately, they need retrained asap!!  ** 2nd) just as soon as they get started cutting your hair the telephone rings or someone comes in to be waited on & sure as you are the one in the middle of the haircut, they will stop and wait on whomever and whatever & then try to up-sell them some hair product while you wait, & then as they finally come back to you and apologize they forget what they were doing and one sideburn goes to your chin & the other is trimmed above the ear and same in the back of your head where you can not see when they spin you around to check your haircut in their hurry to get the next victim!  do not tip if you are not satisfied, it's the whole reason why we do or don't leave gratuities!  it's not an entitlement !  ***did they do a good job? ***were they personable? ***did they give your service undivided attention? ***are you happy w/the end result? *** did you double check the service and what you asked for, or did they rush you to get next client in the chair?  *** if they rushed you, they need more stylists*** you are doing no one a favor by tipping therm generously & having to go elsewhere to start your haircut over again! *** there are many wonderful barbershops & stylists in socal area !!    especially along magnolia or burbank blvd !!    ** another reason i'm a tough critique on the chain type shops, is i went to cosmetology school & was a sales person for a top shelf hair product & if you have seen what i have seen as far as unsanitary, believe me, you would be hopping  out of that chair if they don't use a neck strip!**  other reason is i have had to go to doctor to get boils removed from bak of my neck due to their laziness ! not much fun injections and scalpels cutting these ugly things out,  & the root is usually deeper than what they cut out!  neck strips are very cheap to buy & only take 5-10 seconds to put around your neck under the apron!   god be with you!"
i walked in a had a standard shampoo and blow out. the staff was very professional and friendly. the salon was very clean.  i had no appointment but i was taken care of right away. i love how it turned out and i believe i have found my new salon!
"i took my grandson for a haircut and he loved it, although forgot the name of the person who cut. i have curly hair and need a straight blow dry every week and took a chance at this salon, since they do more quick haircuts.christina did a wonderful wash and blow dry asking questions what i would like, and was pleased with the results.i went back and marisol did the blow dry using a shine product,  she was quick and hair was silky feel.  note:  if you wash your hair at home you save $$ since the store will charge for a shampoo."
"sport clips, the place to get an affordable haircut in la canada ($22), has a new competitor. great clips is a chain of hair salons specializing in affordable haircuts ($15). when they first opened, the cuts were $7.99 (opening special). that lasted a few weeks. now the cuts are $9.99, though i'm not sure how long that promotional price will last.the location is convenient - right next to gelson's. there's plenty of parking. the location isn't busy yet. you can check in and see what the waiting times are by going to the great clips website or downloading the great clips app. that's definitely a nice feature. i think the chain is good about sending out occasional coupons. it's pretty no frills but it gets the job done. they also sell haircare products. sport clips customers all seem to be men and boys.  great clips feels more unisex."
"came in with a $9.99 coupon for a haircut, usually $17.00. katsama was my stylist and she did a great job, just a #1 buzz on the sides and back of my head, easy peazy. great conversation. definitely would come back when my usual stylist in glendale is $21.00 plus tip."
really disappointed with my daughter's haircut today. uneven and not a nice cut at all. will not go back.
"i went there due to the convenient location and grand opening special ($8.99).  esmeralda did such a terrible job... here are the lowlights:it took almost an hour to do what normally takes about 15-20 minutes (i just ask for 2 on the sides, finger-length up top, far from rocket science.)i told her at least five times that it was too long up top, but the message was never quite received as intended.  when she asked what i meant and where, she lifted up a spot on the left side and asked, ""here?""  i said, ""yes, and everywhere else up top.""  so she just trimmed the left side slightly, and that's how i ended up with a quasi-bowl cut that was longer on the right side than the left.when she showed me the back, i was disturbed, to say the least.  i said, ""ummmm... it looks like wolverine back there.""  her response, ""what?  oh yeah, i see what you mean.  it's naturally curly back there.""  first time i'd heard that.  and it's not curly if you actually, you know, cut it.she also wouldn't cut a portion of my hair because of a ""cowlick"".  that was a new first as well.at the end she goes, ""would you like some product?  it should help.""i laughed/cried about it to some other people who had gone to this location, and they had similar horror stories.  for a store that was only two weeks old at the time (i had to wait some time to post this until the yelp page was up), that's pretty impressive.i went elsewhere to get it fixed the next morning, and they simply could not believe i had gotten a haircut the previous day.  the back was still a bit of a mess afterwards, such was the damage done.  time was the only thing that could help that at that point.i also texted a buddy that if he got esmeralda, flee immediately.  he did not heed my warning and had to go get it fixed as well.sad, because the location is quite convenient.  oh well."
great barbershop! reasonable prices and friendly barbers--i'm so pleased with my third cut from them. wafa and mckindly were terrific. go there for your next clip.
"i saw the previous review and was surprised...i was in and out in no time.  it may be that i came in the morning on a weekday.  the manager was very friendly and sat me down right away.  now i am a 53 year old man with thinning hair so i don't imagine i would have the problems as the last reviewer, but she was able to provide exactly what i asked for.  i have since gone back.  i appreciate that they keep there cutting instruments clean with disinfectant.  the previous salon i went to also did a good job, but in about a week the back of my neck would break out.  i finally caught on that it was in relation to the timing of my haircut and the last time i went i spent particular attention to if they cleaned their instruments...they did not, therefore i am making this place (great clips) my new spot!"
this is our favorite spot to get our sons hair cut at! they are so good with him! thanks for an awesome experience
"cliped my hair at this location. it was good experience barber lady was gentle and polite. she did what i need in my hair cut and she asked me how is it in each stage, which was impressive. would go their for my hair cuts from now, i guess."
"friendly enough staff, usually has 93.1 jack fm playing rather loudly on the radio. i like that they save your haircut preferences so it doesn't really matter who cuts your hair. some stylists are more chatty than others."
it's my second time coming here... i love the check online part.. it saves me time and best part i love the prices. staff is very friendly
i come here once or twice a month and i am taken care of. i have never left unhappy. no one cuts my hair like they do...i love great clips
i've been bringing my son here since they opened. he's always happy with his results. my wife and other son have started going here too. i cut my own hair or else i'd likely get haircuts here too. great job!
"great clips is a good place to go and cut your hair. dolly cut my hair she had cut it the way i wanted i recommend you guys to ask for dolly to cut your hair but not only dolly ,cynthia, adriana, susy and the other girls who work there! they are all very good"
it was so professional and they were so understanding to what i wanted to do with my hair. i got a wash and a haircut & i was pleased with everything (: amazing service!
i like to come see kao because he is pretty laid back and is pretty cool to chat with when he's cutting my hair. he understands how i want my hair cut.**update- i found out that kao doesn't work here anymore and decided to make a life decision so that was the last time i visited this one but they are nice here but just go to a different great clips and get my hair cut by someone who knows kao small world haha *****update even more- i continue to visit great clips even though now both of those gentlemen are gone. the experience is great and i love the online checkin. download the app and you can check in before you go and you have your spot in line held. it's convenient enough at the moment. not a great deal check in online but it is catching on!
needed a quick hair cut before vacation. came here and was pleased with the service. shop is clean. it does get busy so using their online check-in is the way to go. overall good experience.
this has been my go to place for a haircut for the past 2 years. i never really know what i want for my cut but i always leave looking much better than when i arrive. thanks cynthia for my last cut!
kinda bummed just left and the sign in store said get $5 off haircut if you leave a review or check in whatever i did and only got $2 off that's sucks and realized she didn't ask to do my eyebrows damn it now gotta go home and do myself and i tipped $7 on a $13 haircut. i'm done gonna just find a new place
"i always come to this location and they do a good job every time. the place is clean and everyone is friendly. online check-in will help save time, so i recommend that. prices are fair as well."
told them once how we like it and they've gotten it right ever since. they let you check in online and tell you their wait times which is convenient. the coupons they send in the mail is also helpful.
this has been my go to place for haircuts! great cut every time.  my son used to hate getting haircuts until he came here.
great place to get haircut professional and knowledgeable also like the idea of the online check in!
"convenient location in dtf, took me in with no wait and no appointment, got a quick cut and am very happy. clean shop inside and everyone in her greeted me with smile. adrianna is awesome"
my go to place for a quick cut or trim. always friendly and helpful staff. very clean. love the ability to check in online.
we always bring our two younger boys here for cuts and they always look great. my daughter loves to get her layers done here as well and they always listen to what she wants.
excellent service by great clips! first time getting a hair cut here. highly recommend.
"like any other great clips, this place gives a good value for money. however, among all the other great clips around this area, i prefer this one particularly because i get my haircut from a hairstylist named hatem. he can cut your hair to the exact specifications that you want. he is very efficient with the old school scissor and comb method which is rare to find these days. in addition, ever since i've been visiting this great clips i've been getting a good number of coupons every now and then which makes me stick to this great clips."
awful. i couldn't get my daughter off the chair fast enough.  she even got poked in the eye!
"really???? for a 14 bucks of hair cut i have to tolerate this kind of service in essex st, lodi, nj 07644.i checked online with no wait time and reached there in time, then the lady there told  me that i will be the next person to be attended. i was a regular customer to this branch and never seen this kind of attitude before. after that the lady keep on attending one after one customer who came after me and didn't even bother to ask  me if i have an appointment or not.seems like they don't want to do business anymore and somehow i have a feeling that they really don't care of their customer. really ??? for a haircut business you think you are the only one?this was my last visit and will never go to any of the branch. bye bye... keep your service and attitude to yourself and will not bother you any more.buyer please be aware of this place before you go."
"whats the point of checking in online if it says 0 minutes wait---and when you get there to wait for 30 min so the people can give their relatives and friends haircuts first.  seriously, what is the point of your online check in app?"
"if i could give this negative five stars i would. let me start by saying i have been coming here for three years for my son and parents. i also am not the kind of reviewer who would give any place 1 star - i generally take to yelp for giving 4 /5 stars. i was here for a quick trim and the person there ( i think his name was hatem or hateem or something ) kept making comments about my hair that were making me uncomfortable. since he was the only stylist available i went to his booth. 10 minutes into the trim i realized he was rubbing his ""junk"" against my knee! i was so creeped out i ran out of there. i will be taking it up with their headquarters and telling everyone i know! do not go here and do not take your children young or old! creepy cheap guy!"
"my husband got the worst haircut ever from this location and the hair dresser had no remorse about her pathetic work. please make sure to ask prior your haircut if they are using scissors or clipper machine. if the person use machine, you might end up getting the worst haircut of your life. they don't even adjust or trim side burns."
"so i just love when i can write a positive review about a business.for many years, i've paid a lot of money for hair cuts that ranged from 'good"" to ""ok"" but never completely satisfied.  i've seen ppl come out of this salon with really good looking cuts &  smiles on their faces.last thursday i really wanted to uplift my spirits because i've been ill for about a year, so i decided to get my hair done but didn't know where to go since i've been disappointed , but then i remembered seeing good looking cuts & the happy faces & i decided to give this place a try and im so glad i did!!!crissy greeted me & asked what i would like done with my hair. she did such a fabulous on my hair, my customers complimented my hair, my female customers asked where i got it cut & by whom, even strangers in the supermarket stopped me to compliment my hair. not only is she talented & loves what she does, but she makes you feel like a friend.i'm sure everyone there is wonderful, but i've only dealt with crissy. i highly recommend this salon & they run specials which helps the wallet. thank you crissy for making look & feel great"
i was recommended by a friend to get my hair cut with janine. she was very friendly and gave me an amazing hair cut. the staff are friendly too.
"i needed a basic cut. i had never heard of this place. i stopped in on saturday, the wait was an hour, but i didn't have time.  the guy couldn't have been nicer to me.  i went back tonight at 8:10 and the 2 women there were accommodating, funny, friendly, and i got a great hair cut.  and had a few laughs in the process.  very great vibe, great music and seems like a family place also. i will absolutely be back."
good haircut every time. doesn't matter what seat you're in. everyone's really good. you can tell they like their jobs. that's who you want cutting your hair.
"this is the go to place for my family. nielsa has been cutting my son, wife and my hair for years. we love going there and catching up and always getting the haircut we want. highly recommend!!"
"great haircut by mario! highly recommend going here, my friend had a great stylist as well! nessa i think. definitely will be back!"
i go here all the time. they do an awesome job. the girl that cuts my hair is nielsa. if you want her to cut your hair you're probably going to have to wait on line. people always ask for her personally. the wait is worth it though
"i needed a quick trim and didn't want to pay salon prices. came here, was served promptly, and the stylist cut my hair exactly as i instructed. all for $13. i guess my only gripe would be you certainly don't get salon treatment/service here. but again $13 for a quick and decent trim, so i'm not complaining."
"no complaints here! great haircut for a great price!  my whole family gets their hair cut there.  we mostly go to jennifer, so i can't really comment on the other hair dressers.  jennifer does a phenomenal job!  make sure you check in on their site before hand to cut your wait time a bit.  i didn't have to wait at all last time i went!"
stopped in yesterday for a great cut. kevin knew exactly what would look right and he worked his magic flawlessly and efficiently. a positive vibe from all employees means a concerned business owner. bravo and keep up the good work!
"worst hair cut experience i've ever had. i came because the place was recommended  to me by a friend because she really likes a specific hairdresser. when i arrived, she wasn't there but i figured anyone would be okay because they had such positive reviews here. i don't know the name of the person who got me because she wasn't wearing a name tag and she didn't introduce herself. she had straight blonde shoulder length hair (think, 'i want to talk to the manager white bitch' hair). she didn't smile at me or make me feel welcome at all when i was sitting down. while cutting my hair, she kept insulting my hair, saying it's too dry, the ends are too brittle, etc, but didn't really offer any tips besides just 'use leave in conditioner.' i get that upselling can be annoying, but after insulting my hair that many times, you'd think she'd be a halfway competent  employee and at least offer a suggestion. i have long hair and i asked for layers and granted while i did say 'keep the length,' she took it as i'll take a centimeter off the bottom, and she construed 'layers' i'll give you one layer in addition to the bottom of your hair. so yes, i technically got 'layers,' as in my hair has only two layers and barely different than when i came in. i am beyond disappointed and humiliated by this place and i urge any other girl with long hair to stay away. it's just not worth it. go to a real salon, even if they charge more because any paying customer should not be treated like she treated me."
"we had a coupon for $6.99 haircut and my husband usually goes to super cuts so i said why not try something else? he liked it. clean place, no wait time. we were taken care of right away. would definitely go there myself for a trim or a cut. a star for cleanliness, another for good service, 3rd for no wait time and 4th for the coupon !"
"just got back after getting an amazing haircut from a great stylist named kevin. i couldn't recommend him enough, makes getting a great haircut easy by explaining different aspects about it so you know what your asking for all while giving off good vibes and making you feel at home in the chair."
silly to pay salon prices when this is around the corner. i've always had my cut done by gina and she's great!check in online before you go to ensure you're seen quickly. and don't forget to ask for gina!
this is the best place around to get your haircut. the staff is the best and does a great job. they are very friendly and make sure your cut comes out perfect. thanks for the consistenly great haircuts!
giving 3 stars because they are severely understaffed and you always  wait 30 minutes or more even when using online checkin. good haircuts but waiting and waiting is ridiculous. hire more stylists and i will change my rating. one of the stylists is quite abrupt and has little patience especially with children.
clean place; very friendly....but i was told 30min wait and it's been well over an hour. needless to say; i'm not very happy. luckily i get a buzz cut at a level 1 1/2 so can't mess that up....hopefully.
you get what you pay for. not bad for children's haircuts $11.00. definitely check in online to avoid the wait.  they need to hire someone to keep this place clean. their is hair all over the salon. its pretty gross.
pretty decent place for a haircut. location is pretty convenient in a strip mall shopping center by 440 in bayonne. it's slightly quicker in terms of traffic as coming from jc wouldn't have to deal with the tonnelle circle traffic so its not a bad choice if you're in jc. price is pretty standard ($14 for men's haircut) and so is the service. i think the lady that cut my hair was bit more inexperienced but she was quite friendly so overall the experience is pretty decent. the building is quite clean as expected and i didn't have to wait at all on a weeknight so those are quite pleasant indeed :-)
worst hair stylist.  please look at the picture i uploaded of my husband who just returned from a lousy haircut. a pair of scissors in the hands of a 13-year old can ensure a better haircut.
need to start taking my 12 year old to a better place. there's a new hack every time we walk in. they hardly listen to any change from your last profile. beyond rude.
"worst customer service. planned my day and and to save time i checked in online which showed 20 mins wait.. reached the place 15 mins after check-in and was asked to wait. 3 others checked after me and saw my name 2nd in the list on the display. however they made me wait another 25 mins while they provided service to all others in the list until i was the only one left.  didn't have the courtesy to let me know what's going on. well, online check-in probably means bottom of the list for them. who knows how much longer they were gonna take before my turn.after such a waste of time didn't care to get a cut anymore and left.  never going there again"
"this place sucks like anything. had a lousy and crappy haircut . never get a haircut here at least from the person who did my haircut, shanette( deserves the name here due to the rudeness)when i called back, she was rude and hung up. never going back  and lost a recurring business for at least 2 yrs"
"this place is the worst!! i will never go back to this place again. stay away!! gloria and shannette were the corner stone of this place. shannette is a very talented hair stylist. she used to cut my hair, my daughter's and my son's. she is amazing!! she is also very nice, funny and talented. i was so disappointed to hear she was gone.gloria also is very talented she used to cut my wifes hair. i went in the other day, only to find out that they are both gone!! unbelievable..rumor was they were mistreated and managers used to curse at them in front of customers. my son needed a haircut so i walked in to see if someone would cut his hair, and to my surprise all you can hear is gossip and cursing from the two african american ladies talking about their employees. that is so unprofessional!!!  calling them b*tches and talking about  them in front of other customers really!! i was so embarrassed my 9 year old boy looked at me and we just walked out.  while walking to our car a lady said did they just ruin your hair too. i laughed and said 'no way"" did not give them a chance. this place has changed so much..i felt like when i left i was walking straight outta compton..so sad.."
"we might have a beauty school drop out on our hands. gloria and lauren are great. but blank (feel bad putting her name) needs additional training in basic hair-cutting techniques. okay. i usually get my hair cut from lauren, who is an amazing hair stylist. but she wasn't working today, so i rolled the dice. i ended up with blank who seemed nice enough. i told her to buzz the sides, trim the top, and blend it all together. that's usually more than enough information. the problem was that she had no idea how to blend. i tried to guide her through the process, but i'm a guy and there's only so much guidance i can give. at one point she got snarky and said in an impatient tone, ""i just did what you asked me to do.""  well, what i ended up with was sides that were nicked up and looked like absolute garbage and were not blended into the top at all. i cut my loses and paid the bill, feeling uncomfortable because i knew my hair looked terrible and that blank did not have the skill to cut it adequately. i walked out and asked my girlfriend (who was waiting in the car) if she thought it looked as bad as i thought. and she gasped and said it looked terrible. so, i went back in and luckily the attractive blonde haired woman named gloria took over and actually trained the other girl as to how to blend the buzzed portion with the scissored portion. within moments, my hair was fixed. so the two i can vouch for are lauren and gloria. blank is sub-par and needs additional training. the other stylists are probably good. i would give more stars because my hair looks fine now, but it's saturday and i didn't need all the nonsense. back to beauty school."
i went in for a haircut and i was greeted by gloria who was with another client and that she'll be right with me. so a few minutes later she comes to me checks me in and i'm in the chair. this was the first time i was at a legit salon. so i showed her 3 pictures and off she went walking me through the whole time she knew i was weary since i always got a buzz cut. i got a tight fade and she cleaned up the top a bit and spiked it and am i freaking happy! she's awesome...highly recommend her. oh plus i was running late and i got out of there with waiting to get in the chair in about 10-15 mins. i am very pleased. she gained my trust and i will be a repeat customer. only problem is...i lost my $10 coupon for my next cut hopefully they honor it. anyway i recommend gloria.
"so i decided to get my hair cut here since my normal lady was unavailable at my usual spot. i tend to get the same cut, short with layers,  but i'm also picky as to how it should be. i must say that i'm not disappointed with my cut. the girl that did mine (i forgot her name but she had red hair and tattoos) was nice. she took her time and did exactly what i wanted. it was also nice that i didn't have to wait very long."
"i like it better than the supercuts up the road because it is less pretentious.  but wash your hair before you come, because there is no hair washing sink here."
"gloria is the best hair stylist i have had work on my hair. my hair is super fine and thin and she manages to make it so even i can style it without much effort. when she does the style it looks fantastic for a couple of days. she's the only reason i go to great clips, if she isn't working, i'll go another day."
"i'm not going to lie. the only reason i came here was because they sent me a coupon for $5 hair cut coupon.  i mean $5 for a haircut?! even if i end up looking like larry, moe or curly, i'm down only $5. i went on a sunday, and it was unexpectedly crowded. i guess because more hair salons are closed on the holiest day of the week. the wait wasn't too bad, maybe half an hour. my hair is short and simple so i just got a 1' fade. it was a really good cut. i was pleasantly surprised that it was. they seem to do hair for all types of clientele so they seem skilled. i noticed that they did try to sell their hair products, especially to women. regular cuts for men and women are $14. i would go back... sooner if they gave me a another $5 coupon."
"this place is just okay. i prefer supercuts down the street. i think it's the decor and colors that make me feel that great clips is for older folks. i came here when it first opened when prices where low and i only return here when i get coupons in the mail. the haircuts seem standard but with less finesse and skill than at supercuts. eh, i would come here in a pinch but i don't prefer it."
this is a great hairstylist! they take care of everyone that comes there and listen to what you want. i even gave them a picture and they were able to duplicate it. they are friendly knowledgeable and helpful. i'd recommend them to everyone.
"i am a female and started going here about 6 months ago.  i get my hair cut every 4 weeks. it's very short and i like it cut a certain way.  i was fortunate that the first girl i had did a great job.  came back a second time and she was gone.  i then had a second girl cut my hair, she was patient and eventually got it the way i like it.  after using her for 3 cuts, she's now gone.  not knowing she was gone, i went there again, expecting to have her and was told she was not in and not sure when she's coming back.  i now had a 3rd girl cut my hair.  she was nervous and unsure, but fortunately she also did a good job.  today, i went in expecting to see my second stylist and there was not a familiar face. i used a women that was very confident and assured about cutting short hair.  she used her fingers, a comb and a buzzer and i still walked out unhappy.  i was informed that there is a constant turnover and the haircuts are timed, so she could only devote a certain amount of time to me.  she bragged that there was no wait today because she was there and she bangs them out (the haircuts).not sure i will return there because i cannot keep explaining to different people all the time how i like my hair.  now i know why they keep notes in the computer, to keep the next person informed.  this particular women refused to even check the notes in the computer.  i hope someone in a higher capacity checks these reviews and can correct the problems."
"i've been bringing my kids here since they were babies bc well, it's cheap and it's a kid cut. but dear lord, after the hack job one of their ""new"" stylists did on both my kids, never again! the turnover rate in this place is unbelievable, but come on now, if you can't cut hair straight, please, just turn in your scissors. like, my kids are getting the simplest of hair cuts. the last time, some new yapper who claimed she used to own a salon, (and now you are working at great clips?), cut both of my kids hair at lightening speed claiming since she's been doing this for so long, she can cut this fast. i was horrified after i did my kids hair the next day, her hair was cut on a complete angle with the left side being about 3 inches longer. even my kid noticed, so it must have been bad. will never return to this or any other chain type hair ""salon"" again."
"i've been going there for some time now. being able to check in on line is a great help to me as i am usually very busy. they keep a record of your last haircut style. i try to get the same stylists every time, like patty or renee, but you can't make appointments , you have to wait for them. there are also some two star stylists in my experience. you have to find who you like. otherwise, they are quick, clean and efficient."
i had a specific request. i gave a picture and everything. now my hair is at least 3 inches shorter than what i wanted. they basically gave me a pixie cut. it's the worst haircut i've ever gotten. i have no idea how i'm going to fix it. the sides are uneven. it's just a huge mess. so now i have short hair and i have no idea what to do with it. i will never come back. going there was a huge mistake.
"i've been using this salon since it opened a few years back. i've always been pretty happy with the cut and service. the only problem is hair stylists leaving, without a word, after you've used them for a couple of years. today i decided to once again pick a new stylist.  i walk in, two girls are both working. i take off my coat, sit and wait. neither girl acknowledges me. usually they greet you and check you in. nothing. okay, so i wait. the first girl who finishes says she needs to use the bathroom so i say i'll wait. that was a lie as she got a cigarette and proceeded to chat with the other stylist.  now i have to wait for the second girl who's giving a woman a trim off the bottom of her long hair. that's it.  but she's talking so much that it's taking longer than it need be. i stand and say, i think i need to come back later. oh honey you need to be somewhere. yes, i'll come back another time. then she proceeds to talk about me to the woman whose hair she's cutting as if i couldn't hear her. hello, i'm standing right here. i hope the doctor who owns this salon reads this and speaks to her employees.  i'll be looking for another salon. way too much competition."
"was there 2-3 times hoping they'll do nice men's haircut, but all they can do is to cut your hair as you're a child going to school. terrible experience, will never go there again"
"i have always dreaded having to get a haircut. i have a very hectic schedule. i never got into the notion of going to a specific place for a specific barber/stylist, and having to be available for them when they are available. this has lead me to jump to various places trying to find a place i'm happy with, and haven't found it until now. i always ran into problems having to tell someone new what i like and don't, even if i went to the establishment before. other places spend more time trying to push the products they sell rather than cut your hair. then there are places that turn a basic cut, into giving you a cup of coffee, try to sell you  a shave and whatever else. all nice and all, but i just want to get in and out. which bring me to great clips - been there now a few times. hours are convenient, the online check in, and seeing how long the wait is awesome. the staff is always friendly, and best of all, they take notes! i walked in for a recent cut, they welcomed me and they started reading notes of how i liked my hair cut done from my previous visit.....wasn't even aware they took the time to write notes from my last visit. this takes one of the biggest pains for me out of getting a haircut. i can go to great clips at any time, and be helped by anyone on their staff..... and they have notes how i like a cut. they have products for sale, but never pushy about it. everything fits the bill, for someone that always dreaded getting haircuts. ....not to mention the bill itself isn't all that much, especially with coupons they send out. ( which like the another reviewer noted, i enjoy ... not so much to save money.... but it allows me to tip more to the staff)"
"very friendly staff!, i love making an online reservation and not needing to sit for long when i go. i have gone to several of the people there and they all gave great clips!  i am a big fan of the coupon i get in the paper or in valpak for a $8.99 haircut which allows me to tip the haircutter very well!  nobody anywhere beats that and my hair grows very fast so i save $$$."
the staff is very friendly and do a fine job. i would like to see them offer free wifi. while waiting i noticed their wifi was locked. providing free wifi would be fantastic.
zero -i received a coupon in the mail and had to use by a date- it was $8.99 and jackie was to cut my hair last night. i always like to find a picture of what i want to show so the haircutter- has a good idea what i want- i went there - and no one was getting any haircut last night- and they did not have a large selection of haircut books- but i found one- a shorter style than what i had- so i dont think jackie even wet the hair- i showed her- she made no comment or advice like if it would look good- etc- i said it was shorter ok- summer is coming- she started to cut- the back- and it felt little short- then the sides were longer with angle- she was finished in like 10 minutes- no gel put in nothing really- she had  a poor attitude- and maybe it was due to my coupon - she just sort of lopped off my hair- i thought it was okay. after looking at it- more- the front pieces - one is longer than the other and fatter- it is noticeble- and where she lopped on one side - its not even blended- ive gone to beauty schools and got better blended cuts = upon close look it does not look finished and professional- i called joy the manager who said she will redo it- and blend on april 9 but i cant wait until then so i will go on saturday- co workers say it looks god but they did not see it up close- it looks good and fresh because i lopped off alot of hair - but the haircut is not good- unblended-by  disgruntled hairdresser- i hope they can fix this- they need an attitude change-mistakes dont deserve tips either-
the staff here is great awesome people to deal with and really felt like i was getting a haircut at home that is how friendly the girls are here i would definitely recommend this s poo t to anyone who wants a great cut and great conversation
came here today my son got a quick haircut no real line there was 2 ladies workinggave my son a faux hawk 12.00 simple and quickthey sold good products and gave my son a lollipop young heavyset latino girl did the cut
"this 5 star rating is based purely from the point of view of roi . the ladies reading this review , if you , like me , find spending upwards of $20 on a haircut an indulgence , and upwards of $30 an exorbitant amount to pull out from your wallet for this particular activity, chances are , that like me , you don't have too many options . well - good news , after much thought and research , i finally found this place which will give you a decent haircut without charging you an arm and a leg . so , are there places that can give you a crazy , totally ott hair cut that make you feel like beyonce for the day ? of course . but then you gotta pay like queen bee or if you are in the mood of saving some money and still getting a pretty good service , go right ahead and give this a go !"
i would highly recommend this hair cutting place! i had called around town for prices and all of them were disappointing. i called asking if they do donation hair cuts(sending your cut hair to company's that make wigs for children with cancer) most places wanted to charge me a nauseating price for me doing a good deed. i called great clips and the women was very respectful and professional and was willing to help me. i walked right in didn't have to wait as i have in previous places. she was very comforting and made the hair cutting experience very calming. i was nervous to cut a large amount off. i will definitely be going back and telling my friends about the amazing experience i had.
"there are slight nuances of my haircut depending on the stylist. i get a simple fade and trim. overall, everyone is welcoming. rarely is there a long line, which is a huge selling point for me."
i needed a quick trim the last time i went. one of the lady's who did my hair was awesome.  i wish i remember her name. everyone is professional an they no their scissors. i will definitely come back if i am in a squeeze for time. the prices are not expensive so i feel take advantage of it.
"this place is a nightmare. i went in for a simple trim, and ended up with botched layers. have to go to a real salon today to have it fixed. you get what you pay for."
"you will find a 2 year old who cuts better hair than the staff at this hair salon.  terrible isn't even a strong enough word to describe the haircuts they give.  i can not tell you how much you will regret ever going to this place.  i once went in there and told them to cut the sides and back of my hair short and keep the top medium.  you know what they did?  took a electric razor and just shave my head.  no scissors on top, just a 2 minute buzz cut and charged me.  maybe i was the only one who had a bad experience, right?  not at all.  my sister went in their to get layers, all they did was trim it in a straight line.  my brother and uncle went in their to get haircuts similar to mine or just a trim, they too went through the 2 minute slaughter that they call a haircut.  the haircut is around $10, but please, spend just 5 more on a hair salon that actually knows what they are doing.  even if you are a person who just likes a buzz cut or a shaved head, the cuts you get from their speedy process is not worth it.  it's as if they are in a competition of who can give the worst possible haircuts, how this place hasn't shut down yet is just mind puzzling.  take my advice, do not go here"
"this place has really good service, wait time is very short and staff is very friendly, the one girl i go there for sindy does my hair really well i prefer her each visit. the pricing is very affordable and its very convenient to check in online before you get there unlike most haircut/hairstyle salons."
"great place to get your haircut! the place is clean and customer service is outstanding! this is my first time here and definitely not the last time when i'm in northern nj. my stylist name was ""anita"". she was very courteous and professional. anita's skill is shown through my result. she asked me what style i would like and also made recommendations. it was a pleasure to visit this place for the first time! i do recommend it to all... also ""great clips"" offered a free haircut on this nov. 2016 veterans day to all veterans past and present! i salute you ""great clips""!"
"if you want a $15 haircut, you're gonna get a $15 haircut. it's hit or miss with this place. sometimes they get it right and sometimes they screw it up. i'm done with the russian roulette. perhaps it's my fault for not having a dedicated stylist i go to. i just wait for whoever is available. i'll be taking my business elsewhere.online check in is pretty cool"
i have gone here quite a few times and it's not very good. the only reason why i even kept going was strictly out of convenience. my boys are young so they arent too picky. the prices are cheap but you get what you pay for! every time i went here they messed up my sons hairline. i've tried every single employee they've had in the past few years and not one was able to do the shape up even and straight. seriously now... is it too hard to ask for a straight line? i told them every time to make their side burns pointy but they always cut them off. how irritating! i have found a barber for my boys that does an amazing job now. its $14 per child but well worth it! i've also had my hair cut here and they did aan okay job. nothing to rave about. it was $12 so that made me happy lol. this place does a much better job on females than males. not one of these ladies was able to shape up a hairline!! not one. i will not be returning here.
"a very nice hair salon where you can get a good haircut at a very good price. the staff is very friendly and accommodating. they recognize and greet regular customers. there are discounts available, including an $11 haircut for seniors."
"good, solid place to get a haircut. very friendly management and staff that does a good job for each and every client. haircuts are affordable as is, but be on the lookout for frequent coupons on the back of shop rite receipts for added value."
"the few times ive been there, (same haircutter) been totally disappointed, she really had no clue how to give a good haircut, or what she is even doing. trims one sideburn only, leaves patches of hair uncut, seems to be in a rush. what is up with that? and why would a place keep a loser like that employed there?  if you care about what your hair looks like after its cut, find another place!"
"destroyed my hair .. i asked for a simply low fade and trim on top and i got an uneven fohawlk .. if you do go, don't let jennifer cut your hair"
i was out getting my nails done when i heard of a great deal on hair cuts. i was told about a 7.99 hair cut so i had to go and find out. i went into this location and had a shampoo and cut. nielsa assisted me and was very friendly. i went in for a basic trim but nielsa talked me into some long layers and i am very happy with the result. i am pretty sure that i will be back every month for a trim. the wait was near zero. the store is clean and fresh looking.
fran cut my hair and she did a very good job. you can tell she loves hair by her knowledge of all things hair. highly recommend her to anyone and would definitely get a hair cut with her again.
"staff was always complaining. they don't take any time to do a decent job. they pay attention to you if you are a regular. if not, good luck with getting a decent haircut. please note: the asian chick in her late 40's is a airhead & the worst of the bunch. ...good luck!!"
i usually come here all the time but this time another worker worked here and her name is jeannine. not only did she have attitude but she was laughing at me because i asked a question. totally unnecessary and that was not needed at all. i will not be getting a haircut when she's around
"i've been going to barber shops for over 15 years but today i found myself in a desperate situation so i figured i'd give this place a shot based on other yelp reviews.  i'll admit i was nervous about getting my haircut here but carol was really nice, very friendly and gave me a great haircut...better than what i had been getting to be completely honest.  she'll be getting my business again."
"i've been to this place 3 times expecting to get a decent haircut....always end up walking out dissatisfied. the stylists there are only good to you if they know you very very well. anything other than that, you'll walk out with a patchy haircut........last time i was there, i can hear the lady getting annoyed every time she sees a customer walk in. i say she should call it a day and leave if she cant take anymore customers. it was on a sunday at 1pm. the result was she decided  to rush through my haircut and i ended up with a bad haircut. that is when i decided that i'll try my luck somewhere else....take my advice and take you business somewhere else."
it's shark week. my kid loves sharks and josefina gave him a great sharkhawk. he loves it and so does my wife!
"i have taken my son here for hair cuts since he was 11 months old. every single time he has gotten his hair cut, he has cried. he is a toddler. he doesn't like his head held and he doesn't like sitting still. but, guess what? we've always survived. i took him in today for a quick cut. after waiting 40 minutes, i told the lady cutting his hair that he would sit on my lap ( like normal) and that he normally does cry but that's why i brought a pacifier, cartoons, and snacks. then, she changed her attitude.she told me she will immediately stop cutting his hair if he cries or if another customer says something about said crying. um what? i am also a paying customer, so why shouldn't i get service as well? do we kick babies off of planes because they cry? nope, we deal. do we kick toddlers out of restaurants because they make messes? nope, we deal.if you don't want to cut a toddler's hair because they will cry, then don't say you're a family establishment and have prices just for toddlers. i immediately left and the lady gave me dirty looks without offering a solution. i'm not going to risk getting half of a hair cut just in case my kid starts crying and annoys the two other customers that were in there. hey stylist: you work at great clips; if you want to discriminate, then maybe work somewhere better.there's a reason this place has low starts--crappy service and crappy stylists."
great service jelen was very patient with my daughter and took her time to give her a great haircut!
"i'm giving this 3 stars but should be 2.5 at most. this place gets the job done when you need a quick little touch up and clean up. nothing fancy. they are barely ok hairdressers. they get you in and out asap and looking decent and presentable when you need it in a pinch. this is why i go there often. and because it's very close to home. you get your haircut there at your own risk. either way, they are fairly nice ppl that work there."
"we had a great experience at great clips! our 8-year-old chopped off her hair past shoulder length into a pixie cut. they do excellent quality work for low prices- she got her hair cut with a super deluxe treatment (spray, gel, etc.) for only $12 for a child! the lady who cut her hair seemed to truly care that she did a good job and smiled each time our 8-year-old did. the job was quick and lasted less than  the expected time they told us of 40 minutes,  so that was a pleasant surprise. not only are the hair cuts cheap, but the great clips ""menu"" listed several other services, including shampoo, etc. all for roughly $15 or more, depending on the service. great clips has the quality of any hair salon or barbershop with prices that can't be beat, and we certainly enjoyed our experience at this branch- we tipped $10, almost doubling the cost of the cut!"
i go every two weeks and i get great service.  it's best if you have an idea about your preferred length and ask to cut a little bit if you're unsure.  as my old barber used to say: i can take it off but i can't put it back on.  i check in online and usually don't wait.
"for some reason, the people here do not listen to what i want. they act like they are trying to rush you through and as if they do not want to cut my hair. 7min to cut my hair and got the exact opposite of what i asked for. had the same experience now 4 of 5 times i have gone here."
"i've had some pretty bad experiences at this location but nothing tops last night. i was in a pinch and had to get a haircut for the new job i'm beginning. i specified low fade knowing my hair sticks up and doesn't look professional if it is to high. the lady, i think josefina bruno, proceeds to start off low and then buzzes the entire side part out of my hair. if i had wanted the hipster style without a side part,  i would have asked for it! i'm trying to look professional and she completely ruined that chance for me. i have never grabbed the sheers out of the barbers hand regardless of how bad the cut was,  but this lady kept on creeping up on the sides and her fade was completely disheveled looking, so i grabbed her sheers to stop her from cutting anymore. the manager came and took over my cut to fix it,  and even admitted that whatever she did was the best she could do to not make my hair look weird. she even suggested that i not do my hair as i've been doing because it won't look good for now. but after all of this,  i had to still pay for this horrible haircut and will be able to get a free haircut only next time if that manager is there? are you freaking kidding me? what the hell makes you believe i want to ever step foot in this location or any great clips ever again? as i said,  i'm not someone to ever complain and for me to write this is a big deal. i'm still seething from how horrendous the experience was, and this is about 12 hours later. something needs to be done! people should stop going here not let these awful people ruin anyone else's hair!"
"i've had one good experience and one bad. it depends on who cuts your hair. the last time i went, the ""stylist"" cut my shoulder length hair in just 3 minutes. since it was damp i couldn't quite tell if she got it right. she said it would cost me extra to dry it. two months ago, another stylist spent a good 15 minutes cutting my hair and lightly styled it with a blow dryer so that i could actually see the cut - and all for the same price. she made an effort. clearly the other stylist did not care about customer satisfaction which is the biggest issue with this place. in fact she was annoyed to know that another stylist had lightly blow dried my hair at no extra cost."
"so, i get sucked in by the $2.99 grand opening special and planned to get a trim since i couldn't make it to my regular stylist.  parking is ample but poorly designed for this new complex ... an accident waiting to happen.  just drive slowly and avoid the over-eager parkers and watch the turns (narrow lanes and bad visibility).great clips is an a la carte shop.  cuts are normally $14, shampoos another $4.  not sure if the styling is extra (i.e, blow dry) but regular styling was listed at $20.  i arrived at the salon and there was only one woman and her son in the waiting area.  great!  i should be second on the list.  nope, there were five other names in front of me.  no big deal ... so i'll wait.  the receptionist called the next person on the list via phone and waited 15 minutes for her party of four to get in.  irked that there isn't a first come, first served policy, i still waited patiently for my $3 trim.  while i waited, i saw several women and children get their hair cut.  after seeing their results, i got a little scared and debated whether i was about to make a big mistake.  layers and lengths looked uneven and i saw the woman who was in front of me point out several points of concern on her new hair cut to the stylist.  then she had the stylist fix her son's hair (he had gotten it cut the day before).  taking that as my cue, i headed for the door.  a bargain is a bargain but a bad hair cut is 3 months.i think this place is great for kids and people who may want non complicated hair styles.  but i'm not sure if i will take a chance on this place."
beware stay away ! they chopped my hair !! the woman did not know how to use scissors. i did not pay them and screamed for what they had done to my beautiful hair. 0 stars
not that bad. it depends on the person that does cutting.  i had some good experiences and i had a couple of really bad once. i would give them another try.
"worst haircut ever. its so uneven i have to now go get it fixed somewhere else. whatever you do, don't let sun cut your hair. i said i just wanted a trim and she totally butchered me. do yourself a favor and spend the extra $ and go somewhere else!"
"ok i have to say that i went there with extremely low expectations due to all the negative reviews.  however i really needed a trim and i had spare time after my wax at european wax right next door.  on a saturday morning at 9:15am there was no wait.  i was greeted quickly by the next available stylist, katelynn.  she asked me what i needed done then we proceeded to get a wash.  the wash was just okay, but that could just be me since i am used to the ones in chinatown where they really scrub with their nails and give me a massage afterwards.  anyways, i digress... once i got into the chair, the stylist was nice enough to advise that everything is a la carte so i don't get surprised by the bill in the end.  i appreciated that as some salons hit you with a big tab afterwards with no warning.  katelynn was very careful and made sure to ask me how much to take off since i am growing out my hair and hate short bangs.  the blowout was nice too but i think it was a bit pricey since i have gotten better ones in the city for much cheaper (like $15 cheap!!). ultimately i am happy with my last minute decision to walk in despite the reviews.  it's just a matter a luck with great clips depending on who you get paired with.  final bill $55 ($20 for wash and cut plus $35 for blowout)."
"despite the reviews i decided to stop by on a monday evening for a quick trim for me and my 6 year old girl, and gotta say it was quick and pleasant , place was clean amanda was super nice and patient with my daughter , they used biolage products to wash our hair, i didnt style it so i'm not sure how it is as far as blow drying but for a basic wash and cut i was pleasantly surprised!"
"well, gotta say, after not getting the best haircut in the world on my first visit, i went back, and katrina, the manager, assured me that it would be corrected. she cut it exactly the way i liked it and really knew what she was doing. she took care of me, even staying later than normal, as i came in late. she makes a great manager and i'm sure this great clips will be successful. the other girl that was working that night that cut my son's hair did a great job as well.kudos to them for reversing my initial decision! and thanks so much to karen as well! ;-)"
"stay away!!!! i took my 2,5 yr old son and crystal chopped his hair so bad that i had to take him somewhere else to get it fixed. crystal, the stylist was so miserable from the start and has a major attitude problem. she is so unfriendly and has no idea how to cut a boy's hair. she cut my son's hair crooked and gave me a huge attitude when i kindly asked her to fix it. she then cut it even worse. i will never go there again!!!!!!!"
nobody speaks english therefore i couldn't get across what i wanted. literally just had my sides done then went somewhere else for top because she used a 1 clip instead of a 3. i should have checked out yelp!
"pretty bad ....messed up my son's hair and had to fix it at home.  i did call and ask if they cut hair for 18 month olds....they said yes.  the woman that cut my son's hair kept on saying he's moving too much and she's afraid to cut...well, if they had experience then they would know.  you get what you pay for....going back to pumpkin and bean...expensive but they know how to handle yound kids."
"awful service. nobody even acknowledged me as i stood at the desk waiting to be checked in. so i stood there awkwardly for 2-3 mins before someone told me to have a seat. i was only there for a trim, but i was surprised the woman cut my hair without wetting it at all. if you're looking for an inexpensive haircut, try supercuts in hoboken."
"quality hair cut from friendly stylist.  not a high end salon and not priced like one.  in cut and out.  much better than the city ave location which is more culturally diverse.   need a quick cut, this is the place in drexel hill."
this is one branch of a big chain. the good news is-* clean and neat* competitive pricing* decent hours* in and out relatively quickly with no appointmentthe bad news is it can be difficult to get the same person each time.  if that's important to you another alternative may be your best choice.
"3 strikes and they're out.  there are plenty of other local places that are inexpensive that will give you a good cut.  i've tried them as well as others i know, and it's not worth having them ruin your hair then you have  to grow your hair out just to have another stylist fix your cut.  skip, skip skip!"
"i bring my son here for his haircuts and the stylists consistently do a great job. they maintain a computerized record of the clippers that were previously used, so there is no guesswork in trying to figure out what made the last haircut so great. the salon is tastefully decorated and i've never had to wait more than about 20 minutes - usually there is no wait at all early on a saturday morning or weekday evenings. you can also use the computer check in service to reduce your wait, but i haven't found the need. they have lolipops for the kids after a job well done. high"
i've been here quite  a few times and never had a bad experience.  everyone here is so pleasant and the store is clean as can be.   $13 haircut - yes please!  keep up the good work!
"what a rude, snotty staff....even laughing and saying they don't want to work on you to their other co-worker like you're not standing right there in front of them when we're donating for locks of love. it's not like anyone was even in the shop when we came in. wow...thanks katie. i don't know why we just didn't leave if it weren't to donate the hair. a tip shouldn't have even been given to the other co-worker who seemed to tolerate us until she was given the more than deserved tip for her attitude. what a disappointing visit to philly, especially when we were out to do a good deed."
"decent and cheap haircuts in the newtown square, you pay 12-14$ as a child or man, women pay more. my goto place around work"
"disgusting-don't ever go here. dirty is an understatement. stylists will upcharge you and sneak it on your receipt- that's what they did to me. nickel and dime, bait and switch to a loyal customer. after confronting their tactics they told me, ""we don't care if you ever come back, your dad, too. you can go to hair cuttery and look like an idiot when they screw up your hair."" this particular franchise does not care about their customers whatsoever. they'll likely be out of business very soon treating people in this manner. some small businesses truly deserve our money...this one does not. shameful. infinite negative stars.one year after i wrote this review and i contacted great clips corporate and received not even a return call, the owner ""joe g."" comments on all of the bad reviews with a copy/paste apology. it's laughable and demonstrates exactly the issue with great clips. i wouldn't return even if it was free haircuts for life. are you even real ""joe g""? and if you are the owner, a blanket copy/paste apology to negative reviews is a pitiful attempt at saving face on social media that will not counter the scarred reputation of this store or bring back past loyal customers. a year later...smh."
"i showed her a picture, i asked her to not take anything off the length. she totally ignored me and cut it so short i could cry. i'll never go back again!!!!"
i took my mom for her hair cut.  she is 86 most certainly a senior.  they have a senior cut for $12.00.  it cost her $35.00 because she wanted her hair dry before she left.  she did not get her hair washed either.  but we were told the $12 was a cut only.  who goes out of a hair salon with wet hair. really $24 to have your hair washed and dried is ridiculous and nobody would go into the cold with wet hair.  a ridiculous ploy to pull seniors or anybody for that matter.  not to mention they did not seem professional. never will we return.
consistent haircut every time with fast service.
"this shop is terrific!  larissa and irene are very good.  haircut is efficient, personal, and always what i want.  the haircut is so good that it is literally wash and go at home - very good styling."
"the staff was pretty unfriendly, which is always weird because you expect the person cutting your hair to converse at least a little. the haircut was quick and to the point, just not friendly."
"so normally i like this place for a quick cut for my oldest. i showed them a picture of what he wanted. something like that.  she says "" yeah i can do that but the edging up there? that's not going to happen. i can do the rest but that i cannot"". ok i understand you don't know how to do that because it's a ""barber"" thing. but to say ""that's not going to happen"". learn how to talk to customers. that's not the way it's done. you say that you cannot do that it's more detailed than you can do and maybe a barber would be best. but ""that's not going to happen"" just made me want to deck her. will not be coming back for a quick fix. i'll make the appointment at the regular and just wait it out.  that just brought the 4 star to a 2."
"check in on line, then wait again in shop. store is a hot mess and the associated was not nice. waste of time."
i checked in online and got serviced right away when i arrived.  usually when i get a haircut it takes about 45 minutes start to finish.  i was here for 20 minutes tops.  they rush through and don't take their time to get to know what you want.  i feel like there are parts of my hair that didn't even get cut.  there are plenty of other places in the area that are in the same price range and are better.
"i was a walk in on a busy saturday and was prepared to wait forever.  instead of forever, it was more like 10 minutes, which was nice.  carina did my hair and she did a really great job.  i went in there and told her that i wanted it short with an angle, and she went above and beyond making sure i looked good.  she asked me several times if i liked what she was doing and made sure that i was comfortable.  really excellent job for only $13.  i will definitely be back in the future!"
"cynthia.....my wife has been thrilled with the care and the time that cynthia spends with her. i tried telling her for years that you don't have to spend $65 to get a good cut and now she's a big fan. she cuts mine as well; although there's a lot less to cut, but spends time with mine as well"
"the good: - adult hair cuts are $15. - wait time are short, plus you can make a reservation ahead of time online. - easy to get it & plenty of parking. - clean location & friendly staff. the bad: - the skill level is not totally there. i left my most recent haircut unhappy as the hair dresser did not follow my request and completely missed strands of hair. unfortunately the good does not outweigh the bad here & ill be finding somewhere else for my next hair cut."
"not a good experience.  i checked in online and when i arrived told the woman at desk i wanted hair cut, blow dry, and style.  it seems she was annoyed i wanted "" the works"" as she told another customer why there was going to be a wait. if this is a problem then the service should not be offered.  will not be going back there."
r u serious ...$14 for kid hair (7 yrs old) cut....wow! they didn't even do a great job! the faded isn't right it goes up and down like a zig zag.
"after two calls to corporate headquarters with promises that the owner would call me to discuss, a negative review on yelp, and a complaint to the bbb, i finally received a phone call today from a manager stating that they would refund the $25.00 they charged for my daughter to get her hair washed and blown dry. they want me to come back in on wednesday to receive the refund. when i questioned why my sons were charged adult prices, they informed me that those prices reflect 10 and under. my one son is 10, and i pointed that out. the manager told me i had paid that price for him before after looking back at our records. they will not refund the money for charging him as an adult. so---the fact that they've been scamming me for a while makes it okay, i guess? they also said coupons would be sent in the mail. honestly, they can keep them. it's a shame. my family has been patronizing this place for years. there was a much better way to handle this and it started with the manager working with me the night i was upset that my daughter's haircut was $44.00 without any warning. avoid this place at all costs."
"not that it is that difficult to cut my balding hair, but for some reason i am always happy when i walk out of great clips. the stylists are always very friendly and try to make conversation with you.  they only charge 15 for a cut and certain times you can go in and get it for less.i did not make an appointment or check in online but i have never had to wait for more than five minutes.  this time was no exception.  the place always seems clean and organized.  i have to other places where they leave the hair on the floor between cuts and the stylists is always rummaging around in her draw looking for a clipper attachment or something.bottom line, quick, reasonably priced, friendly, clean, and they make me look good, what's not to like?"
"what a great place. the staff was friendly and upbeat. online check-in got me in and out really quickly. the area is great too, close to restaurants , other businesses and a grocery store. the shop was quick and convenient and great quality. i will certainly be back."
"better haircut in this area.  adrienne did my hair cut, she was good.  they charge $15 for adult hair cut."
"they do an online check in which i don't get, but, also so walk inns. they don't do color, but, do cuts and the basics. i'm not sure why i ever allowed anyone but tiffany to touch my hair, she is the absolute best stylist in the area! if you're looking for a great haircut, new style....someone who is approachable, funny, sweeeeeeet, and a great stylist see tiffany."
"horrible !!! i'm giving one star because i have got haircut from this place before also and they were good, otherwise the last experience with one of the hair stylist deserves zero star and was the worst ever. i'll just suggest them to stick with basics: be nice to people, and don't take customers at the 8th hour if you don't want to serve them. some hair stylist working at this place neither have skills nor experience with hair cutting, they r just pass timers..issued in public interest:- do not go to this place on thursday evening."
cheap decent hair cuts. been coming here for years with my son. everyone has always been friendly.
"i've been a great clips customer for 5 years at the voorhees shop; this was my third visit to the marlton crossing shop. never again!  my son flew in from l.a. on an all-night flight to attend a friend's wedding.  we took him to great clips for a trim which should have taken no more than 5 minutes. we called ahead to make sure the shop was open, then we went right over from the airport. it was about 8:20 on saturday morning when we entered the shop. the stylist was with a customer (no one else was waiting).  she asked if we checked-in online and we told her we did not. she told us that, nonetheless, we would be next and our wait would be 10-15 minutes.  although my son was very tired, we felt 10-15 minutes was reasonable, so we sat down to wait.  about 25 minutes later a man walked in, said he checked in online, and was then taken before us. how can an online check-in trump an in-person check-in?  my wife objected because we had been waiting patiently in excess of our estimated wait time; however the stylist just turned her back on us as she escorted the online customer to a chair. wonderful customer service, right?  if this is great clip's policy, then conceivably we could wait all day as people keep checking in online and we keep getting bumped. such a policy is also discriminatory toward the elderly, many of whom do not have or use a computer. it's time to say goodbye to great clips."
"worst haircut i ever got from one of the stylists here. i have got haircuts from this location earlier, and they have been good. this review just reflects the one experience that i had."
"although the staff was very friendly - i will never be going back to this place.  after cutting five inches off about half of my daughter's hair - i see the stylist combing thru the back of her head.  i walk over to ask if there is a problem and she tells me there is lice.  another stylist comes over to -confirm.  after i freak out - first about the lice and then about them leaving her hair like that - they took her in the back and did a hatchet job cutting the other half.  they tried to sell me their $42 kit to get rid of lice but we left and got it at cvs for half that amount.  after four hours of treatment and combing thru her hair piece by piece - we come to find out that it was actually just sand!  we had been at the beach earlier in the day.  in my panic - i did not mention that at the salon but i would think they should be able to tell the difference between lice and sand.  and if they bothered to shampoo the client before cutting the hair - it would not have been a problem but apparently they just wet the hair.   they did not charge me for the ""haircut"" but i wasted $20 and four hours of time - not to mention having my daughter so upset!   i also now have to get her hair cut again to fix the unevenness.  total customer service fail.  i am livid!"
"i'm not sure if new people were hired but this place has gotten a little better. got the haircut i asked for, quick and easy.a few mistakes here and there but they don't question and they're glad to fix it!if you want a inexpensive and quick haircut, go here.but don't expect it to be perfect!"
very disappointed with this place.my son always ask for this barber gene that cuts his hair multiple times in this place.we went because we knew he would be there.checked in and waited 10minutes for this specific barber since he was cutting someone's hair and then he was done.we were the only one waiting then a guy came in and was asked if he registered online and he said yes.he took him right away and we ended up telling them to cancel us because we asked specifically for gene.why did the other guy go first instead of my son?
terrible. checked in online and it said 0 wait time. got there about 5 minutes later and i was somehow 7th in the queue with a 35 minute wait time. they also took someone lower on the queue ahead of me. someone even said something and they still took him ahead of his place in the queue. the stylist i had didn't listen to me at all and cut layers into my hair despite me saying not to. and cut more off than i asked for. you get what you pay for i guess but that wasn't even worth $16. for that experience they should have paid me $16.
just got vincenzo's first hair cut at great clips in springfield!! great experience!! thank you so much to our wonderful hair dresser danielle!!
"worst experience ever! went here to get my daughter's haircut. we just moved to the area. the lady was so rude told my husband she would just cut my daughter's hair all off. my daughter is a 8 year old, who does get tangles easily. she had a few knots in her hair but nothing a little brushing would not have taken care of. this lady made my daughter cry and said some really hurtful things. my husband did not get her name unfortunately, but it happened today january 2. i would never suggest anyone go here unless you like being insulted. wish i could give zero stars. went to regis salon at springfield mall immediately afterwards, my daughter got a great cut and was treated wonderfully there."
they butchered my son. my 11 year old son has the easiest hair ever. seriously i have 3 kids and this one is a no-brainer which is why i allow my husband to take him to great clips. yes that's a loaded statement but all he needs is a buzz. seriously. we have never had a problem getting him a decent buzz cut. well.... not only did they use the wrong setting (a 1 vs a 2) but the neck line was completely crooked and they completely shaved bald his forehead line which again was crooked right across the front of his head. it is the craziest thing i ever saw. my son was in tears before he even left great clips and no one said anything (yes including my husband who paid and tipped for this atrocity.) i was heartbroken for my son when he returned. i have photos but will not post them in public. if anyone from great clips wanted to contact me i would be happy to share with you directly. i'm appalled at the horrible cut. i can't imagine the person who did this was even a licensed professional. luckily his hair grows fast and he is easy to forget. we will head to a seasoned professional stylist next time and pay more for a cut. i would think twice before entrusting your hair to anyone at a great clips especially this one in springfield.
"i've been here a few times and, overall, haven't had the best experiences. the real reason why i get my hair cut here is because it's close by - not for any specific stylist.frankly, all i've ever seen when i walk in here is semi-depressed looking people. no, not the customers, the workers. that's with the exception of only one woman which of whom i don't know the name of that is very bubbly, seems nice, and actually knows what she's doing. on top of that, they don't have any one person manning the register so people sometimes fight over who was waiting longer since no one was able to put anyone in the system for their waiting iist.i must say, though, that i've had a few stylists who have made my hair exactly how i wanted. but that shouldn't be as hard as they make it for a simple pixie cut."
if you want a nice haircut avoid this place at all costs. it seems like the common theme amongst all these reviews is they don't listen or care. i've gone to this place the last few haircuts and i can't do it anymore. they're very inconsistent. i get the same haircut every time and they always find a way to screw it up. latanya the lady that cut my hair this time finished my hair in less than two minutes just so she could chat with other coworkers. now my hair is very uneven and i'm embarrassed to go to work.
"customer service wasn't great, stylist spoke more to others then me. my hair was not  washed just sprayed with a spray bottle. my cut was ok but no offer to dry my hair. i left with my hair feeling dirtier then when i went in."
"my son went to great clips in springfield, pa, as he usually does, but this time he was very dissatisfied due to the butchering he received from the stylist.  we told him that if he was going to be butchered like that he was better off going to roy tweedy's ( which is a real butcher shop). i'm not sure if it was because he was a teenager, or for the fact that he use the coupon that was mailed to us, but either way they did a horrible job, and it costs more to fix his hair the way it should have been done in the first place. my husband called the salon upon my sons return, to see if we could resolve the situation, but of course we never received a response. no call back from any manager, or any apologies whatsoever. i would highly advise that no one go to great clips in springfield until they get their act together! as for us, we are a large family and we go there a lot, but will never step foot in that place again!"
"this is a chain, but a good place for a haircut. the people are always very friendly and talkative, and the haircuts are good, at least for easy hair like mine.they ask for your phone number, but don't worry- they won't call you, they just save any information about how to cut your hair and associate it with the number. that way, the next time you come in you don't have to explain what you want! for someone who lacks hair vocabulary, it's a big help.the only problem is that they will brush your neck with a lot of baby powder without asking you- you must let them know if you don't want that much.walking there from swarthmore is not the most pleasant, as you have to cross baltimore pike."
"needed to get my hair did- i live in the area and have stayed away from this place since you have to pay for a wash and a cut and a blow dry. but if i'm going to pay $30 somewhere else- why not!they do not offer color or other specialties- only cuts. i went friday night, 5pm and was in and out. i have had some scalp issues so sahara used tea tree shampoo and conditioner and spent some extra time working it in- it felt awesome.i wasn't expecting miracles since it's a walk-in salon but she gave be a good text-book layered hair cut. she was pleasant to talk with and didn't talk too much.nice work!"
"used to be typical now terrible. seriously twice i've gotten cuts by trainees who really are not experienced. one didn't even get how to blend/fade and i have the worlds thickest easiest hair to cut. i had to have her buzz it all off so i didn't look like a damn crooked rooster. after complaining to corporate, come to find out this is a franchise and they flat out don't care. fortunately chain chop shops are a dime a dozen.adding a point because another great clips location saw how messed up the cut was and fixed/recut for a huge discount."
they close 10 minutes after i got there and told me they're not accepting any more clients. i can get a crappy haircut anywhere but i choose you because you're close.
"i thought this great clips used to be really great. but, tonight's customer service was so horrible that i actually decided to install yelp app and give review so that folks will expect what kind of service they are getting. i would like to request the management team to start looking into their employees attitudes. not all of them are bad. some are really good actually. but, it's usually one that creates seriously disgusting customer experience. one bad experience might overshadow the past good experiences. i intend to visit this facility in coming days. i hope the management team takes my review seriously and i hope get to better quality services.p.s: tonight's haircut was so horrible that i could have done better job myself. i am never letting the same hairstylist touch my hair again."
"twice now, my husband has come here and the stylist has messed up to the point of just giving him a shaved head because there was a lack of communication or knowledge, i am not sure, on the stylist part. i then foolishly thought this place might be better for my children and my son now has uneven hair and my daughters hair just hangs with no style or shape. very disappointed, we will not be going back."
"my husband went to get a haircut yesterday, saturday, and was greeted by a pleasant and professional young african american woman. (the only reason i'm mentioning that is he forgot to get her name.)we were both so pleased with his haircut  and she now has a permanent client. we can't speak for the other stylists, but she did a great job. my husband's hair is very fine, and the way she cut it was perfect."
"i went to get a haircut on sunday, march 25th. the posted hours say that they close at 5pm. i tried to use the app so they knew i was on the way, but could not since it was within the last half hour of the store being open. i drove over and arrived at 4:42. and was promptly told they were not taking any more customers. there were no customers waiting and no customers being serviced. if i had arrived at 2 or 3 minutes before closing, i might understand. but it normally only takes about 15 minutes to cut my hair. needless to say, if i hadn't pre-paid for a card for the year, i would not be going back. i would like to know if the owner has other stores in the area where i could use the pre-paid card so i don't have to go back. i never had any problems for the 5 years i was using the store in ridley township, but apparently there is a dramatic change in professionalism when you move just 8 miles away."
decent haircut for a reasonable price. the quality of the haircut greatly depends on the stylist you get.
"was really in need of a good haircut the other day so i stopped in this great clips.  my hair was in terrible shape after having been butchered by a woman from another hair place over 6 months ago, and then being ""trimmed"" here and there by my mom and two daughters.  had a wash and cut for $16 plus a tip which wasn't bad at all.  dee did a great job, and thanks to her, i feel so much better now!"
"i went to great clips after my stylist at another salon left.  i brought two pictures to give the stylist an idea of what i wanted.  she asked me some questions, restated what she thought i wanted to make sure she understood, and gave me a fabulous cut! it's so rare to find someone that actually listens! the cut was exactly what i wanted.  it was $12, plus tip.  ive paid $60 or more at local salons and wasn't nearly as happy as i am with this cut.  this particular stylist is no longer there, but they all seem excellent.  women are constantly complimenting me on  my hair and asking me where i go.  they are shocked when i tell them."
"my boyfriend went in for a haircut today and from the second the girl started we both knew she had no idea what she was doing. she was super young and looked completely lost. the haircut was patchy and just looked all around awful. the manager i guess had to to fix it, and still didn't do much. would definitely not recommended this place."
they do a fine job. it's quick. the ladies are always nice. it's inexpensive. i do recommended checking in online or on the app ahead of time; otherwise you could wait a long time.
"you get what you pay for. i was the youngest guy inside. all seniors. well, the clip was nice. no razor neck shave like barbers do. people were friendly and nice."
"let me start off by saying i've been going here for about 5 + years. i went in to get it clean up. and easy bob with a tapered underneath. nothing hard. nothing fancy. while i was waiting i even found a picture of the length and the taper that i wanted. so i show ""rosemary"", get in her chair and it just goes downhill... she starts to cut, walks away to talk to another stylist, comes back and continues. not long after i asked for a mirror. i had told her due to a cervical spinal surgery last may i could not feel the back of my head. when i look in the mirror i knew i was going to have a terrible panic attack (i do suffer from anxiety). she had cut my hair so short up the back she could have used clippers. my hair is in the shape of a horseshoe! the back is completely butchered up to the top of my head and she left long sides so from the front it looks like a super duper short bob! after having cervical spinal surgery last year they had to cut open the back of my head. there is no way i would get a haircut this short to highlight a scar that runs into my head like that. i was so upset i begged my husband to cancel our trip down the shore. it was only two nights but he had surprised me with a"" you deserve this trip baby, it's been a hard recovery for you"". being on disability, i cannot afford to cancel a trip like this. i reached out to corporate great clips who put me in touch with someone who works with the owner. i told him what happened, i showed them pictures, and all i want is to be refunded for my trip. not much to ask right? do you think that's happened? the moral of my story here is do not go here! and if you are, if you are that desperate, do not let rosemary near your head! great clips has enough customers and they can afford to lose 1 after 8 years. they can afford lose you too!!!"
jacqueline gave my son a huge bold spot and didn't have the decency of telling us it happened. we noticed when we got home. very unprofessional for not reporting her mistake and apologizing for it. she should not be cutting anybody's hair.
a great haircut doesn't have to have a big price tag.  i've visited this great clips on several occasions and have yet to be disappointed.  worth driving to this location because the girls here know what they are doing.  never too long a wait and check in a available online is an added plus.
i feel bad because the staff here is always so nice but the past few times i was very specific about how i wanted my kids hair cut and either my requests were just ignored or the skill level isn't there. it was always hit or miss but too many misses for me lately. not going back again.
great value where you can get haircut very affordably if you're not looking for frills i highly recommend it. i have been here 4 times and they always do exactly as i request. for an additional affordable fee they will wash your hair - to save money they suggest going with freshly washed hair. online check in saves time they're very friendly clean and professional here.
love this place. i feel like family every time i am there. and they make me look like a million bucks :)
"they listen to your needslook, they talk to you if you want to be talked to, or they just cut your hair. but, they ask you what you want.they also always suggest styles, cuts, . products for your hair and scalp.they are helpful and good at what they do. i've never had a bad experience. i drove from philadelphia just to go to this location."
"i'm giving this place 1 star, i went there a year ago and loved my hair cut. i went there 2 weeks ago and was mortified with how short she cut it after telling a specific length to cut it, i just now straightened my hair to try getting used to it and she butchered my hair. she was rushing to get out by 4, my whole wash and hair cut took about 20 minutes, having long, thick, curly hair it should've taken longer. a year ago i would've recommended this place to everyone, after the experience i just had.... absolutely not."
"my first time here, after recently moving to the neighborhood.  i waited about 2 minutes to get in , and michelle gave me a great haircut, with very confident hands !!  what more could you ask for ? !"
"i walked in about 15 minutes before closing in hopes of getting my son a quick trim. all three of the hair dressers turned to look at my family but said nothing. an extra rude glance was given by the other blonde haired woman in the first booth. after awkwardly waiting for a few minutes we decided to leave. again, on our way out the door the older blonde woman gave another rude look. i understand it was near closing time but if you don't want costumers, instead of making us feel like were not wanted please just lock the door."
"never a long wait.  i recommend lindsey. she is attentive, child-friendly and sociable unlike the other cryptkeepers that work there.  the tan, feathered,  farah wannabe is one to avoid.  i hate that they don't take phone appointments. otherwise, great place."
"i've been using this great clips for about 2 years. i always get great service. i understand the level of customer service that needs to be given with the public but the girls there go above and beyond. only complaints i have are with great clips itself. it's hard for someone to stop cutting hair and then jump back and forth and answer phones and service the walk ins and still go back to cut hair! hire a desk girl already! let the stylists focus on the customer. and any other customer reading this... understand these ladies are doing mulitple jobs, tip them well!"
"i went in with middle of my back long, practically one length hair. i needed a quick easy trim and couldn't get to my normal girl at a real salon for 2 weeks. i told the stylist that i wanted about an inch off, maybe 1 1/2 - 2 inches if i really really needed it.. during conversation, she asked how i usually have my hair cut. i told her usually i have the stylist put a long layer in it (note: i did not ask this stylist to do that.  just a trim).  by the end of my haircut my hair was completely butchered!!!!!!! there was a layer in my hair that came to mid cheek.. i haven't had bangs since the 90's and my hair felt like i was in the mid stages of growing bangs out (ladies you know what i mean!).. i was in such shock about what my hair looked like that i couldn't say anything. i just paid and left. when i got home, i realized i couldn't even put my hair in a ponytail, low or high without using bobby pins to secure the pieces that were too short to be pulled back. i also realized that my hair was uneven and the layers were not even blended. this cut gave new meaning to the word 'choppy'.. i didn't go back and complain because all they would do is tell me that they would like the chance to fix it. i have a problem with that for 2 reasons. #1: channel would never touch my hair again  #2: the only way to fix this mess would be to cut it even shorter and at that point i would have practically a pixie cut.  i am just going to let it grow for a month or 2 and then go to the real salon i normally go to and have a real stylist fix what someone at great clips destroyed..  you really do get what you pay for and i would never recommend this place to anyone. it is awful!!!!"
"we lucked out on this beautiful weather sunday.  after getting our dog groomed at 'petsmart,' i saw the signs for $7.99 haircuts at 'great clips.'  both of my children needed cuts, so this deal was too perfect!   we barely sat down for literally one minute (despite the crowd) and they were both taken back.my daughter loved her trim (just 1/2"" off the length and trimmed up layers) and her sweet hairdresser, kristina.  my son, who is ultra picky about his hair being too short on top, was happy w/ his cut too (not initially).  he's pretty quiet but his hairdresser, erinne, went out of her way to let my son look through a magazine to pick out what he wanted.  very nice girl as well (with funky blue hair!). we'll def be back :)"
"i came here for my hair donation. i can't remember the name of the stylist that cut me, she was blonde. the cut was free, so i can't complain too much, but the ""clean-up"" was hardly clean at all. i have lots of pieces that are uneven and i have to wait a while to get a trim to even everything out or my hair will be shorter than i want it to be. because of this, i have to put my hair in a ponytail because it looks bad if i wear it down. 0/10 will not come back here."
"worst experience at this location. checked in online got to the store and confirmed we checked in. then the three employees pretended we didn't exist. sadly i used to think this location was half way decent. must be due to poorly trained staff who wanted to hurry and leave. again, horrible experience at this location. my review does not reflect other locations who take pride in their customers and recognize negative posting will effect foot traffic. i will never ever patronize this location again and will spread the word about my terrible experience."
the worst haircut ever.  go elsewhere.  save your money and go to a real stylist.  when was the last time a hair hacker 'feathered' your bangs?  when farrah fawcett was a charlie's angels.  incompetent hackers
i get my haircuts here and i've never had a problem. the staff is courteous and professional.
"fast and no waiting, hair cut wasn't bad and the price was right too!if you're going for a ""fast food"" hair cut, you shouldn't have to wait!"
just got my hair cut. no wait and the cut was quick. jo ann was fantastic. i'm usually indecisive when it comes to how i like my hair to look. i told her an idea and she made it look better than what i was expecting. i'm definitely coming back.
i gave this place another try last night. different stylists were working and was greeted and was about a twenty minute wait which was less than i waited last week who thought anyone even greeting me or putting my name on a waiting list. heather did a good haircut and will look for her again in the future. i think the stylists last week just were not into their work that day as usually in the past service has been very good. there was an elderly man ahead of me and i think neither of them wanted to cut his hair so both just kept dragging their feet so the other stylist would finish first and have to deal with the old guy. i understand having to wait when a shop was busy but they really were not that day. great clips location is convenient for me to get to so hope in the future service is better than that day last week.
my daughter went for a trim and then asked to cut it in a blunt style.  it looked like a chop job.  all uneven and i wonder if the hair cutter has a license to cut hair since its so uneven.
"i went in this location for this first time today and was greeted promptly by one of the barbers, and he ""assigned"" boris to me.  i explained what i wanted, which was a simple buzz cut the same length all around.  very easy.yet he started right away with a choppy, hard, inch-by-inch hack job of my scalp.  instead of an easy smooth buzz, i literally received a constant banging against my head with his heavy clippers, until i asked him to go easy.  he said fair, but didn't really change his style.  instead of a nice quick buzz cut i was subjected to an unpleasant experience.  additionally, his workspace was unclean and his trimmers were filled with other customers hair.  not good!!i will not be going back to this location."
"nothing great about that clip. i did not plan to get a haircut yesterday but after an errand next door i walked in and asked if there was a wait. there was no wait. a lady took my name and typed it very very slowly in the computer. she did not know english very well which is fine i get it. after she asked me how i wanted my hair cut i told her to clip it using number three and make it pretty short on the sides but not so short that you can see my scalp. i took off my glasses and she went to work. she used one clipper and cut the bulk of it and then switched to a closer attachment and cut it shorter and shorter. at this point i started worrying and looked concerned i asked her if she was cutting it any shorter. i put my glasses to look at my hair. it was very short, shorter than i wanted. she asked me if it is ok. i said it's shorter than i wanted. i take my glasses back off so she can finish the top and she puts another blade on and before i could even say a word she cuts it even shorter on the sides. i said it's too short and she tries to remove the attachment altogether and but my hair with the bare clippers. at this point i said no no stop stop too short. she said ok ok and kept doing her thing. i finished the hair cut, it was almost completely shaven on the sides.i checked out, paid and left the place completely pissed off.the worst haircut i ever had.at the end of the day i know it's only hair it will grow. my wife, kids and people i work with will stop teasing me in a couple of weeks as the hair grows back. but stay out of this place."
"i have been getting my hair cut here for several months, mostly out of convenience to my gym. i have a fairly straight forward hair cut. two on the sides and scissors on top for a comb over. you literally cannot mess it up. well, apparently you can. or at least carmella can. it was my first time getting my hair cut by her. she acted like she knew exactly what i wanted and then took big chunks off the top of my hair. i keep about 2 inches up top so i can blow dry it. so cutting down to the scalp was a problem. i stopped her once i realized that she was a complete idiot and she was arguing that i do my hair wrong. like, what? okay, so she tries to fix it but it looks like i let a child cut my hair, and on top of that, when my hair does grow back, nothing will be the same length. i don't know what the hiring process is here, but if carmella can't do a simple cut then she's gotta go. i'm not coming back until she's gone."
"i come into the same bala cynwyd location i always do. ask for the same haircut i always do. tint fade. it's recorded. nasirah asks what do i want to do with the top. i said ""don't touch it, i'm growing it out."" she then proceeds to do what she wants and cuts the sides off. that's not a tint fade. i ask her later if she knows what a tint fade is. she says there's no such thing. and she's supposed to be a manager? check the records of my previous haircuts! google ""tint fade haircuts."" it's very simple. she ruined my hair. i now look like a conehead. it will not grow back evenly the way i had it before. i just wanted the bottom side trimmed down, not the entire side. which is why i was very specific with her!"
great service - nashira always gets it done right. check in online before hand always saves time
"after a few trial and error experiences here, i found mainly through luck a good stylist.  going blindly into a chain like this is pretty much a crap shoot and chances are the person who cuts your hair might not be there the next time.  all and all a friendly place."
i rushed to get to the store for a quick haircut and arrived just before 6:00 on a sunday.  i was informed that they were no longer taking any more customers...even a quick clipper hair cut.  they have just lost a repeat customer!
"i was very happy with my cut here. i didn't need an appointment; i just walked right in, sat down, and started to get my hair cut right away. my stylist/barber was very kind, gentle and conversational. it didn't take too long and it was only 12$ (i believe?) for a men's haircut. (this was the cheapest i could find it in the area for a men's cut.)"
"first review, i've ever written....worst.haircut.ever. and even after pointing it out, still was charged full price...south st barbers...a little farther, more expensive...worth every cent...do not go here"
great clips gives the terrible hair cuts. apparently they will give anyone a job with a degree in cosmetics or whatever it is. never going back there again.
doris did a wonderful job cutting my husband's hair just now. she was very kind and did a nice job cleaning all the hair off after she was done using alcohol pads *more sanitary.
"so far, one cut that i was happy with, and one not so much.  one very friendly stylist, and one not so much (i'm pretty sure she was grabbing bites of her snack or lunch in between cutting my hair).  prices are very reasonable and the location is very convenient for me, so i will probably come back."
"jacquelyne did an exceptional job. neat fade, precision and great service was displayed on her part. oh except the constant teasing between us :p  a job well done nonetheless"
"this is nothing against the employee who were very friendly and courteous with my short interaction with them. my complaint here is about the the poor business model implementation. getting people to sign up for an app provides the business tremendous amounts of insight and information that is of huge monetary value, significantly more than the few bucks for a haircut. in turn i would expect the business to offer a little more in return than a piss poor estimated wait time -- in my circumstance, being told to wait another 30mins having shown up a few minutes shy of the estimated wait time. i understand the concept of variance but 30 minutes? it really defeats the purpose of checking in. the short: the user information provided to the business is worth more than the elementary linear model they are using to ""predict"" weight times.. it is 2018 for christ's sake!"
i have been going to this great clips for almost 10 years. they had some of the best hairdressers.  that has all changed. there's new manager and she has replaced almost everybody who has been there a long time. it's sad because now the haircut quality has dropped off immensely. i've had to return to have my hair cut correctly because the girl left it uneven. my children have been getting their haircut there and my son's hair looks horrible. it's uneven and not layered correctly.it's time for me to find a new salon. i recommend finding someplace else to get your haircut.
"been coming to this salon for 5 years and loved it until this week.my great stylist left a few months back (martina) and ive had 2 haircuts there since.  the first one was ""not martina"" but the last one i had there 3 days ago was the worst haircut of my life.  i'm 60 so i've had a couple of doozies, but this is really bad.  i should have been clued in when the stylist asked another stylist if she was 'doing it right"" half way through.  i entered with long, graduated,  layered curly hair and asked for a trim all over and maybe a shorter layer on top. i showed her the picture i have used in various cities over 10 years. i also specifically stated ""no more than a quarter inch off the ends"".  i trust that these people know what they are doing and haven't been disapointed in the past 20 years, anywhere..............................................i now have a 1980's mullett that is 2 inches shorter in length than when i entered, has erratic layers and looks nothing like my hairstyle of the last 5 years (which i loved). i formerly looked like what i am, an aging hippie. i left however looking like a 1980s 12 year old boy.i wont be going there again.  i am seriously pissed at a store that lets seriously inexperienced stylists practice on experienced customers.  i will be wearing scarves till next winter."
"i love the check in feature on the app! it saves a lot of time instead of just sitting there. bridgette did great washing my hair, taking her time to detangle my hair with the conditioner in it! my trim was great value at a cheap price. well worth it."
a stylist named victoria  cut my hair. it was the best haircut i've ever had in my entire life! she was very knowledgeable and very friendly and i was in and out so fast. i was on my lunch break and i was really worried. i will definitely be coming back and recommend all my friends and family!!
"we are traveling in a motorhome, so my wife is always leery of using a hair salon. okay, let's just say that my wife is picky about her hair and who styles it!!!  my wife was in desperate need to have her hair trimmed so she called great clips and was informed that there was no line and she was invited to come right over. the staff were very welcoming as we arrived, took pertinent information and immediately assigned a stylist. it was a friendly environment. my wife's stylist set about to wash and cut her hair. as i observed this process, a casual conversation between my wife and the stylist occurred and made my wife feel more comfortable and relaxed. my thanks to all of the staff of great clips for their talent, friendliness and professionalism displayed and exhibited during this walk-in appointment."
"i always use the phone app to check in - so convenient! i get there and it's usually just as the app indicates for time waiting. always rotating, i think everyone there has cut my hair. inconsistent. i wouldn't think they could mess up my hair since i keep it short - but they did. and with my bad luck, they screwed it up when i needed it to look nice for a big event. this place is conveniently located but i won't be coming back."
"the staff is really nice. after going a few times they start to remember who you are. i always ask for the same stylist, leslie. she really knows what to do with my hair. thank you leslie, you're the best!!bottom line, if you're looking for a good cut at  good price, this is the joint."
"i haven't gotten my hair cut from a professional in a long time...i'm talking years and for the reason of them always cutting way too much of my hair off. i went here the other day and was so scared i'd walk out with a bob. like always. at this great clips that was not the case! amanda showed me how much she would be cutting off before cutting it off! she cut 3"", layered it, and framed my face no problem! i finally found a place i could go to instead of me having to do it myself. so glad i took the chance here! i highly recommend this place if you were like me, never happy with my haircuts. :)"
"this is my second time at this location because it's the closest place to my house but it's strictly for cutting children's hair, and it just doesn't matter who checks in first or if you do it online or whatever they just take the next person they see and they give everybody a very similar haircut which is all i think they really know how to do... if you care about your hair of your money or just the flat out principle means something don't come to this location."
do not go here! they messed up my haircut that was so simple to pull off. the lady spent 10 minutes on my haircut and the place was not even packed. i would hate to have the same thing happen to you.
"i have a short haircut that needs constant trims, and i was so happy to find this place. the ranges for cuts goes from $8 to $14, which is cheaper than any of the salons i went to before. now if i want to do more, i'd certainly stick with the salons, since great clips has steep prices on styling which is the opposite of the hair cut prices. strange. but i keep continuing to come back and get my hair cut here at least once a month, and i like the results. :)"
"why even bother checking in online?  it went from 5 mins to 15 min wait so i checked in and headed over. 10 minutes later when i got there, they told me it was going to be another 20 minutes and i was at the bottom of the list.checked in another day because it said 1 minute wait. i checked in and headed over. was there about a minute later and it was packed. i was fourth on the list, and when i checked again it still shows a one minute wait time and there are six people on the list. when will i learn?"
"actually great clips,   the name on the building says it all.    can't touch their prices if you just want a cut."
i'm very disappointed with the service at this place. they always have a long wait time and it seems that they only 2-3 employees. i waited there for almost 2hrs for a trim! i would recommend making am appointment but good luck being seen at your apt time. the best part of the visit was the girl who cut my hair was very sweet.
"fast service, the woman who did my hair was great and it was the cheapest hair cut i've ever gotten. i was told that my hair cut looked better than when i was paying $200+"
"good people, great service. been going there for a while now, and always going to andrea. she's super cool and funny. although busy on weekends, strip mall parking is aplenty, and if you happen to have a long wait, you can just hit fry's next door to do some grocery shopping while you wait. target and many other stores close by in this convenient location."
i have been going here for a while now and can't say anything bad about it.  the staff are always friendly and knowledgeable.  there aren't too many times when i have to wait very long to get my hair cut.  i have seen many stylists here and haven't had any bad experiences.  very affordable as far as i am concerned.
i love getting my hair cut here. the stylist susan is my favorite hair cutter of all time. she is from chicago and is a vegetarian and is a single mom. she takes care of her son and is quite spoken but when you talk to her she is very sweet. the manager chris is very nice too. she's cut my hair and explains the way of the business. angie is one of the asst manager and has done an amazing job on my hair as well. all these idiots complain about great clips but they're a great company. while not a barber shop but they do give that home feel
"this review is based on my overall experience with this location. i average about two good haircuts for every bad one here.  the bad ones usually come from the same person whose name will remain anonymous but it starts with the letter r. when this person cuts my hair they finish in about 5 minutes and ask if everything is okay. if i were to point out trouble areas they get visibly upset and then quietly fix the issue. also, this person tends to swear and get visibly upset at times. next time i request someone else if this person is there.other stylists have been good and very friendly. i don't want to let one person drag this entire location down but it would be in the owner's best interest to part ways with this employee.this is a good location with minimum wait if you check in using the phone app. i look forward to giving this location a better review in the future"
"worst haircut/""stylist"" (being generous with that term) ever.  i've typically had good luck here, other than the wait. checked online first, since there was no wait listed went ahead and went in since i'm less than 5 minutes away. should have known this wasn't going to go well since the woman who checked me in wasn't speaking, she was mumbling and didn't act like she wanted to be there. when i sat down she spoke to me like she had no clue how to cut hair and that i was supposed to tell her what to do.  i very clearly told her the length i wanted to keep etc. let's just say i won't be back.  she actually had the nerve to look shocked when i didn't tip at checkout."
"worst haircut everdo you want to look like a primordial cosmic worm after your haircut? this is the place to go. especially during their ""haircut sale"". i went today, and was a horrible experience. there was a huge line because of the ""sale"". so the lady who did my hair was clearly desperate. if you have like a owl timer , you can set it to 4 mins 23 seconds, and you will be definitely done. i showed her a pic of what i liked to have usually. she glimpsed at it as if ""yeah, whatever you want, i am gonna give you what i think fits you"". most of the ""looooonnng"" time spent during haircut she tries to sell other products like shampoo and hair conditioners to you instead of focusing on the haircut. do you have scissors/shears at home? look at it before you go to this store. that will be the last time you will ever see a pair of shears. here you are like those kids in pink floyd's brick in the wall video. it doesn't matter if you are a guy or a girl or a kid or an adult, all of you get the same haircut. 6 on top, 1 on bottom, and fades in between. she ran through my hair like she was mowing a lawn. ""chug chug chug chug...oh, i need to change the song, chug chug chug chug...oh, what did you say you wanted, chug chug chug chug...sorry, am done. i'll note what you wanted so that we can do it next time when we actually have time. out you go so that we can get done with the 20 million people waiting after you due to the sale.""oh, then what is special/extra here? ofcourse, price is special..you pay thrice the money and 1/3rd the quality of other places..her name was angela something if that helps you avoiding her.i mean, i believe in evolution. like humans came from monkeys/apes and stuff. but i never thought i will be reminded of that due to a haircut. girls around me looked like they were getting a good cut when they walked out. but guys, one after the other, were walking out looking down.with that dismal shock in their faces, which said: omfg, what the f did i walk into...or on their phone updating their pic on instagram with hashtag smh.bottom line: if you have clippers at home, try it. you probably might do a better job than paying double ass price for a half ass haircut."
"a big ""thank you"" to susan for giving my teenager: ""the best haircut of his life!"""

"decent haircuts at a good price.cost:save a few dollars and get the prepaid ""great card"" for $9.99 haircuts!service: i like the online check-in, which you can do from the web site or with the great clips app. check-in ahead of time, and reduce your wait time to virtually zero.atmosphere:it's a salon in a strip mall, and they're all the same, what's to say?overall:it's convenient, well-priced, and i get decent haircuts. i keep going back."
"horrible service, checked in online and ended up waiting for over an hour and a half. people not even on the list going before me. it was the worst experience ever! i just moved in the area and been using great clips for years and will never return here. please also check the reviews on fb this place sucks!!!! waited 90 minutes to just end up leaving."
"sadly, i have to rate this great clips quite low.  i would have rated them a 1 star, but the manager did issue a refund for my daughter's hair cut and apologized for the situation.while i was shopping at michaels, my kiddo went with her dad to get a hair cut.  i have been so swamped, i did not have time to take her to my salon.  her dad was given specific instructions on how to get her hair cut and to make sure her bangs were not cut and he relayed those instructions to the stylist.  i received a phone call from him telling me the stylist did not know what he meant by ""face framing layers.""  i advised him that he needed to get a different stylist if she did not know what that meant.he agreed and then hung up.  apparently he argued with her for awhile wherein she said she didn't think it would look good on my daughter.  he told her he still wanted it that way, but if she could not do it, then she could wait.  he said to her that since my daughter was preoccupied on the ipad anyway... that she could just sit in a chair and wait for him while his hair was cut.  well, apparently the stylist went ahead and cut my kiddo's hair anyway, including cutting her bangs straight across her forehead.  well, not completely straight, as some hairs were cut very unevenly.  we have been growing out her bangs and training them for several months.  additionally, she cut some layers so short in my daughter's hair that they are above her eyebrows.  her dad went back in to talk to the stylist.  the stylist made a few more snips to correct the unevenness in her bangs.  however, they should have never been cut in the first place.i knew instinctively that i should not have allowed my kid to get her hair cut here, but this was the second time she'd been.  the first time was to correct it after she cut off a hunk of hair herself when she was in school.  the stylist did a good job then.  should my kid have been in that chair when her dad told the stylist to forget about it?  no.  a place like this has so much turn over that every stylist could have an effect on the reviews.  i understand that.  however, it was such a bad experience, we are not willing to chance it again.  it is right before the holidays... and i really think my kid's hair looks like a monkey cut it.  oh well.  hair grows back.  you get what you pay for so... buyer beware."
"awesome place for what minimal hair needs i require. a simple 5 min trim for 8 buck (sale price today) would have cost 50 at a salon (i called around to 3 other salons for a no frills trim...apparently that doesn't exist at a salon). this was exactly what i wanted; walk in, trim, walk out! the staff was friendly, the place was clean. overall good experience and didn't break the bank!"
"mediocre at best. the grumpy man who failed to greet me when i came in ended up being the one to cut my hair. he didn't say much other than the usual, ""what shampoo and conditioner do you use?""  i have long hair and i asked for a trim and to define the layers. he spent 10 minutes cutting my hair and didn't verify if everything was the same length like most stylists do. he spent most of his time spraying me in the eye with his water bottle. let's say, i won't be back."
"need a quick trim, very fast paced and you can check in online"
"i tend to be too lazy or forgetful to get my hair cut often and when i do, i don't do much special (just a boring trim of my crazy long hair).  i usually go to great clips or something similar and the experience is always pretty good. the staff is friendly and does a fine job. i could do with less up selling of hair products. i'm sure they are incentivized to sell products but i could do without it."
"ive been to great clips twice. first time it was just me and second time with my family. both times angela cut my hair. she is great, and i highly recommend asking for angela when getting your hair cut. overall everyone is very friendly and good atmosphere. i am used to getting $40 hair cuts, but after getting my hair cut by angela, i will never go anywhere else. unless of course she moves. angela is very professional, and she gave me great advice on what to use on my hair and how to style my hair. she recommended redken anti-snap product for me, and i purchased it. i love it, my hair is very healthy and stylish all thanks to angela..."
"pretty much get what you pay for. i paid 8 bucks and it looks like it too. i keep my hair pretty short and because of this the mistakes stand out. unfortunately i was too far from the mirror while there and didn't notice the differences in lengths and levels till i got home. but then again, maybe my head was tilted during the haircut.  i wish i had been more attentive and the stylist been more on top of her game. i tipped way too much."
"went here, because i forgot to make an early appointment for a haircut at my usual place. been here 2 times before, for the same reason & they did a decent job.this time they ruined my hair. it looks like i have a birds nest balancing on my head.i was there on saturday morning & the stylist was friendly & nice. i had showered already & my hair was wet. i showed her a picture of what i wanted done & also explained what i needed. she went on cutting & as they charge another fee for a blow dry, i didn't get it done & i had to shower again anyway as they don't even bother to brush off the hair that's all over you after your haircut. maybe that's too much work for them.after i washed & blow dried my hair, it looked like it hadn't been cut at all. pieces hanging out of everyplace. they said they layered it, if they did, it was the worst layers ever.i went back in the evening, & a lady who said she was the manager, said she can fix it & went on snipping at my hair. she just took a handful of hair off the top & went snip, snip, snip. i asked her to thin my hair at the bottom, so that it has some fullness & the ends turn out. she said she will do it, but never did it. i was uncomfortable telling her to do something so many times. i am no hair stylist, but i knew, something was not right, the way she went on cutting.back again i had to come home & shower again. my 3rd shower for the day. dried my hair, only to find, the top of my head, my hair was not even 3 inches long. i couldn't even get it on the brush to dry. the other layer is cut so short, that there is a wave right in the middle of my head, looking like my hair is split in 2 with a birds nest at the top. when i wake up in the morning, i look like ""tina turner,"" lol. all my hair is sticking out the top. let me say i have very thick hair & short hair only gives it more static & spikes it making it look like the smurfs.i called them & the lady says, we will refund the money. lol. i said i didn't want the money, i want my hair. what can money do? buy hair? this is hair we are talking about, which (if i am lucky) will take 3 weeks to grow at least to a decent length. this is not a dress that doesn't fit & the refund can buy me another dress.i went back again on monday, as the manager hilary said there was a good person who can fix it. that was shane. he took one look & said, oh yes, it's way too short & there's not much he could do. i totally agree. what can he do to clean up another persons mess? he did try, but finally gave up.i am now left with this horrible looking haircut & wear a cap most of the time. i had to go buy gel & mousse & products i didn't own before, just to keep the bounce down on the top of my head. if not i look like a hot air balloon about to take off. lol.i guess, you get what you pay for. just horrible. the worst is, that they don't even care. it's like something that happens every day & they have got so used to living with it. but then again, why would they care. it's my hair, not theirs & there is nothing anyone can do to fix it now. it's ruined & i have a function to be at this sunday, which i might not go to. a bad hair day, gives you a bad mood, a bad couple of hair days, drives you nuts. that's for sure."
"shane is amazing! i'm pretty picky since i have fine hair and it shows every cut mark. i like a lot of texture, but no razor! he was able to accomplish all this and i love my hair! thanks!"
horrible horrible horrible horrible i want my money back rebeca destroyed my hair i look horrible i paid to get my hair styled she couldn't even do that. my advice don't go here they will destroy your hair.
i love this place!!!! the ladies here really know what they're doing. 100% satisfied. i'm new to the area and am happy that i've already found my go-to place.
"apparently i love to get my hair cut while out of town. and coming from a guy who barely gets his hair cut (and truthfully, barely has any hair to cut) that means that most of the haircuts of the last 5 years of my life have happened at random out of town spots.well, folks, add mesa to the mix. that's where i got my hair cut today, and that's the latest locale where i lopped my locks. men and women of mesa, take note: you can get your hair cut here, too. you don't have to a be an out of town vagabond. they're here every day chopping away, and you can walk in for a trim. actually, as i discovered today, they're really pushing this whole ""check in online"" thing and have a specific app you can also download. i haven't looked at it, but if it sets a reminder for your haircut then i'm totally into it. i only seem to remember at the most inopportune and rushed times (ie. ""oh crud, i'm going to be on tv tomorrow morning and i look like ringo."")as for the cutters--they weren't the most personable peeps on the block, but when it came down to it they all seemed to know what they were doing. my cutress was a nice enough lady and cut pretty quickly. i didn't get the courtesy ear trim (sexy, i know) but i also didn't ask for it. i did, however, get the courtesy eyebrow trim. so that was a bonus i only seem to get at 1 out of 10 haircutteries."
"if i could give then zero i would. cut 13 style 18, not bad right? wrong. the cut, i told her i wanted more layers an volume, i told her i didnt like my last cut. she processed to follow the exact cut of my hair, so now i have the same cut that i didn't really want. fine ..the style, 30 minutes with a blow dryer and a round brush my hair is flat, with weird bumps at the top? i could have gotten the same results letting a three year old blow out my hair for 15 minutes.i told her that i didnt think i should have to pay for the ""style"" as it wasnt what i asked for. i asked for curls and volume. she says she can curl it?? really like i should believe that? do i give her another 30 minutes of my saturday? i pulled my hair into a ponytail,  paid the 36 bucks and left. moral of the story?dont come to this place if you want a style."
"under new managenent. used to be a decent place, now they're running some sort of wig scam. i'm calling corporate.my family was treated poorly today. my sister and daughter both got bad cuts. they gave a free cut to my sister under the guise that they donate the hair. very sketchy about who they donate to. didnt ask if the hair was treated or dyed. i believe they're making wigs or tracks out of the hair and reselling it. not sure this new management is on the up and up. they panicked at the notion that we might keep the hair instead of donating.i miss old management. at least they were honest and up front. at least they gave each person the cut they asked for. at least they weren't running some shady side hustle."
"the best part about this place is the manager. she seems to be working there all the time, besides giving great haircuts she's a genuinely nice person. they have some good stylists but you must keep on them as to the style you want otherwise they will deviate and that's not cool."
"i visited this place for the first time about 20-30 minutes ago.  i am highly disappointed and will never return here again.  here's why:1: i asked the lady to take off less than half an inch of hair instead she whipped out a #4 and zipped the machine through on one side leaving half an inch on!!! 2:  within seconds i had to stop her once i realized what she had done but it was too late. 3: she admitted her mistake and i remained calm and polite asking her to just even it out.  she tried but it didn't look even to me.  4:  the most disturbing part was how she ended it.  didn't even say bye or thank you when i told her that my hair didn't look even to me.  she went ahead and ""rang me up"" and as i was walking toward the counter she just went back to her station.  she said bye reluctantly i kept saying wait, i haven't paid ma'am...she wouldn't say a word and kept repeating ""bye, bye"".   she made a mistake, admitted it but was very rude at the end.  i insisted that i must pay, had my visa out but she wouldn't even look me in the eye.  i keep insisting and finally, i realized that i had $12 cash which i left on the counter and walked out! this is bad for business and i hope the owner/manager gets my message that i left $12 on the counter because the lady attempted to turn this around on me indirectly making it appear like i wanted a free haircut!  i was genuinely unhappy because of her mistake!  the haircut is $13 but i will go back to give them $1 next time i'm passing by.  i do not need a free haircut, thanks but no thanks."
we've been getting our hair cut here for a while. some great and some not so much depending on the stylist. checked in online with a 15 minute wait. been here over 20 minutes so the check in is useless.
"waited for my turn fair and square, after 30 minutes a lady walks in with 2 daughters and because the mom checked in via her phone app, the stylists had to take all 3 of them ahead of me. that just isn't fair. i got up and left. i can see taking 1 of the 3 ahead of me, but all 3 is bologna. this is a poorly designed marketing gimmick created by the great clips corporation.  go back to first come, first served. i like the stylists at this location, but the corporate policy isn't well thought out."
this place has many good  stylists who take their time to give you a good haircut.i have been here over 15x
"understanding that great clips has a quota to meet for how many haircuts they need per week/month, i was still willing to give them a shot. the lady cutting my hair took notes on what i wanted. i told her that i have two cowlicks in the front, and two in the back- incredibly difficult to deal with if they are cut too short. as the hair cutting begins, everything seems normal. but then i notice that she isn't using water to dampen my hair, like every stylist i've ever used does. she was dry-chopping the top of my hair, cutting off about an inch. it felt very sloppy and was looking very weird. next thing i noticed, she grabs a handful of hair on my back cowlick and cuts it all the way off. i was stunned, but at this point didn't care; i wear a hat most days anyways. the thing that upset me most was when she said, ""so i cut off your cowlick because i don't like them. they stick straight up if u cut them short, so you have to cut them all the way down. and when they start sticking up, thats when you know you need to come back and get another haircut anyways."" needless to say, i'll never be coming back here."
"seriously disappointed with my hair cut.  i wanted a pixie with layers on the back,  the girl gave me a buzz cut! i told her i wanted to keep the length of my bangs and the girl started cutting them."
"i came here because cost cutters was closed and i left a bit disappointed.   my cut was fine,  i just went in for a trim but since i was going out after i asked the stylist if she could just blow dry my hair. (not style, blow dry)she blow dried it, barely put a spritz of hairspray in and we were done. a haircut costs $12...needless to say, i was a bit shocked when i was charged $31.00.i looked at the board and noticed for a ""regular style"" was $18.  1. i  don't understand how a style costs more than a cut, 2. i was shocked i was charged their full price of a style when all i asked for (and got done) was a simple blow dry.  when i asked for a blow dry, she should have made it known it would cost me an additional $18.i was pretty upset when i walked out and because of that, i won't be back.  i have never paid near that for a blow dry.  $5, maybe. $18?! i don't think so!"
jenna cut my hair.  i'm always nervous about letting anyone touch it since it's been screwed up before.  she was very patient with me and cut a little at a time and checked in with me then continued after i was okay with it.  some beauticians like to chop the hell out of it and ask questions after.  she was awesome!
"just another place to get a hair cut. i've never got my hair cut here, but my bf has. he was going somewhere else for his haircuts but it was quite a drive to go there every other week. so he's settling with great clips. which he is satisfied with how they cut his hair. he's a pretty picky person when it comes to someone cutting his hair, and surprisingly he likes the barber/hair stylist salon styler person that did his hair and will return for future haircuts. great clips is a pretty decent place for haircuts and the pricing isn't that bad. overall its worth going to."
great customer service with kids. as an exhairstylist myself i know that kids are the hardest to deal with. they have little toys and  stuff for them to play with in the back if mom or dad need a cut while the kiddos wait. love the staff! tip them well. hairstylist live off tips.
"sarah cut my 3yr old boy's hair, she has great customer service, friendly and interactive with my kids and did a great job clipping his hair.  she went quickly without messing up!"
"always have a good experience every time i get my hair cut here. they also send out coupons, making their service even more affordable. i love the online checkin option, allows me to know when to show up- i don't think i have ever waited more than 2 mins. i definitely recommend them !"
"i would give no stars if i could. my husband and i took my 2 year old who was in desperate need of a haircut. we asked number of times if they were familiar with cutting a child's hair, to which we were told ""i have kids of my own, i know how to cut children's hair"". rudely we were asked if we wanted our son on the chair or to hold him. he was naturally terrified of the razor and when he just wouldn't stop crying we had to ask her to stop. she didn't even make an attempt to even win him over or try talking to him. he had hair everywhere, in his mouth and his ears, we asked politely to use the sink to rinse this out, as he started coughing to which she said ""let me ask my boss, there might be a charge""! are you freaking kidding me? they charged us full price for a half done job and we had to wait for permission to rinse our son off. horrible horrible service. don't go!"
"if i could give this place 0 stars, i would. even though i checked in online, i had a long wait because the stylist was too busy doing anything but dealing with me. that should have been my first clue. when she finally deigned to call on me, she asked if i wanted to donate. i agreed, on the condition that the end result be a specific length, she agreed, and confirmed how long it should be. she then hacked off the ponytail way too high and then blithely cut off 3 more inches than agreed upon. this was a trim only and should not have been that complicated!! anyone who needs to cut off 3"" to ""even things out"" is incompetent and should not be working as a stylist. when i saw how much she had taken off, i was shocked. no tip for her. i know how long my hair needs to be to be manageable, and this is way too short. it's more in my face and all over the place than when it was down to my waist!!!never go here. if you do decide to have that lapse in judgement, don't donate. suck it up and pay the cost, because i swear they must get bonuses per inch if they are willing to ignore the customer to the degree that this ""stylist"" did. i almost wish i had paid so i could have the satisfaction of demanding my money back."
i get my haircut every two weeks...they make me feel like its a small town barbershop..quick and great service..always have some sort of a promotion going on..would recomend
"i come here often because it is so close to home and they usually fit me in with no wait. i've never had a bad experience though also never had an amazing one. alana did such a fantastic job i had to write a review. she was friendly and easy to talk to, she listened very well to what i wanted and did a great job cutting my hair. she has a fantastic attitude and clearly works hard too, as i don't think she was feeling well but she made it in to work anyways and was cheerful and pleasant. thank you alana!"
great place to get a horrible hair cut and sweat your butt off while getting it done!!! why can't people follow simple instructions??? i'd rather shave my head than get another hair cut from this place!!!!!
"i decided to have my husband cut off nearly 12 inches. misguided, yes, but wasn't bad. it did need to be cleaned up though. jessica basically saved me from myself. she patiently explained how hair is cut a certain way or another, to make it fall how you want, and do what you want it to do....i honestly didn't know there was more to it than just chopping it off wherever you pleased! loved my hair.the next day i wasn't sure (each side curls differently, it's parted on the side, and one side is thicker, so it really is hard to tell). jessica got me right in. on a saturday morning! no questions, no problems. she did some minor adjustments and i learned a bit more. if my uneven hair was all my imagination, she was gracious enough to not say so. i'll definitely be back :-)"
"you get what you pay for. my haircut was uneven, the service was ""okay."" the lady did a good job with my bangs. i felt like the hairdresser started becoming friendly when i was about to pay. i was seen as a walk in, didn't have to wait at all. place was clean. will come back but probably just for a bang trim."
"do not take your children here! i had a terrible experience this morning when i attempted to have my toddler son get his hair cut at this location. i checked in online; we were up next when i arrived and a woman named marta was immediately rude to us as soon as we walked in the door. my son had not made a sound, but she looked at him (certainly did not greet him) and aggressively said, ""if he cries or gets upset i will not cut his hair."" i was very caught off guard because i have never had a stylist be so unfriendly towards a child trying to get a haircut, especially when he was not even upset. i told her that he usually sits on my lap and we just try to make it work the best we can - recognizing that he is a toddler and can sometimes be unpredictable - and she again said she would refuse to cut his hair if he was even the slightest bit upset. i said that with that attitude, it was probably for the best that she did not cut my son's hair, and she seemed to non-verbally agree (definitely did not apologize or try to dissuade us from leaving or even attempt a haircut), and i walked out. i am very disappointed with this stylist's awful attitude toward children. great clips markets itself as a family-friendly establishment and should not employ stylists who refuse service to children for literally no reason other than their age. we will not return to great clips, especially when there are so many alternatives that will treat children like people, as they deserve."
went to this great clips yesterday 6/11/17 and got my normal haircut. the stylist kavitha was trimming the back of my neck and cut it multiple times and never said a word. the. she put powder on her cloth and went over it hiding the redness. once i got home my girlfriend pointed out it was extremely red with little cuts. if you go here do not get your hair by kavitha!
it's the first time i've been there and the girl with the tattoos hasn't cut my hair some guy did it and have to say not happy with it pretty much left it the same length even though i told him what i wanted.
"we bring the littles here -- they do a solid job, they're patient with all the anxieties kids have (or at least mine do), the online check-in is terrific (especially on mobile devices) and it's not too hard to find a sale or promotion. doesn't cost a lot. doesn't stress me out and more importantly -- doesn't stress them out.tip of the cap to the management."
great haircut from becky today! she was very polite and professional!  she asked specific questions to make sure she knew exactly what i wanted.
"love karla, but when she's not there, they are all pretty good at hearing your needs and producing a perfect cut & style.  i won't go anywhere else.  oh, and of course you can't beat the price."
"it's called great clips, but it sure seems more like ""mediocre clips.""i went in last night with my dad last night, and was greeted like normal and i figured it was going to be a pleasant experience like every other great clips i'd been to. when it was my turn to get a haircut, i sat in the chair, and showed christine the picture of what i wanted. it was pretty straight forward; layers, face frame and a bang trim which is what i've been getting for ages, so i really just needed everything trimmed up. you know something's wrong when your hairdresser says ""oops.""  long story short, my hair was four inches shorter, when i was told it would only be one inch, tops. my bangs are about a half inch too short (if you have bangs you know a little is actually a lot), the layers were blunt, and the length of my hair was literally lopsided. i had to go to another salon today to save my hair. when i got to the salon, the hairdresser said ""wow, well at least she left something for us to work with."" when she saw the..... 'creation' on my head. long story short, i will never, ever, ever go to this great clips again. it was, for lack of a better word, one of the worst experiences i've ever had getting a haircut."
"two bad haircuts in a row. i am done with great clips. bad haircut in september, took three months to grow it back out. went in with a picture of exactly want i wanted. ignored. cut it back above my ears again. i asked why and was told it looked better. i wanted what i wanted, not what somebody else wanted. don't go to great clips unless you are happy with the one haircut they know how to do. me? i am done!"
"i had been getting my hair cut at an expensive salon for years. i've been growing it out for the last year and finally decided to get a trim to clean up the ends. i bit the bullet and went to great clips, and i got the haircut i wanted for the cost of a tip at the previous place. karla was great; she listened to what i wanted and made good conversation.tips: - check in online or on the great clips app. it'll let you know what the wait times are at locations near you and hold your place in line. - normally they just spray down your hair with a water bottle, but you can get a full shampoo and conditioner for just $3 more. - be clear and say exactly what you want. bring a picture or say ""i want one inch off"" and show her where that is on your hair. - the only reason why i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that they don't blow dry your hair at the end. that means you have to go home and blow dry it yourself. it's also hard to judge whether you got the cut you wanted when your hair is still wet."
"i know, five stars for great clips? but it was six o'clock on a wednesday, they were pretty busy but i was in a chair in ten minutes. i was way past due for a cut, there was a lot of work to do but i was out in 15 minutes. the cut i received rivals $60 cuts elsewhere, just with a fairly strong sense of urgency. i had a coupon for $7.99 - don't judge, i make up for it in the tip. it's  a franchise, the stylist did the work, why should someone else get the money? all things considered, five stars is about right."
really friendly staff! they really care about you. just a wonderful place to get your haircut while enjoying a pleasant atmosphere.
"i have been to this location twice - the first was right before a speaking event where i was going to be onstage in front of 850 people! the second was before attending the same event. both times i came here and was absolutely thrilled with how my hair turned out! it's very rare to leave a great clips, loving your hair without styling it or ""fixing"" it once you get home. this place definitely lives up to its reputation as being salon quality for a cheap price! thank you kelly and michael! both of you gave me fantastic hair!"
first time my almost four-year old son didn't cry during a haircut. michael entertained while nicole cut his thick locks. very impressed with the extra time they took on us. michael even entertained my son while my hair was trimmed. very happy customers.
"wow. i usually go to salons, and that's where i take the kids. but this time, we went in a big group, 5 (walk-in) cuts in total, ages 17,13,13,13, and 8. total price 66.00 plus tip. holy good haircuts, batman! i was really blown away by the level of skill that this place had to offer. aren't these cheap places kinda crappy? my perspective has changed. we walked in and walked out in about an hour. craziness.i will have to come back and add names of the stylists. for now, there's pink hair and piercings girl- super smiley, very friendly, and she did a great job on the 2 13 year old girls. then, there was the other lady. wish i knew her name.. i think it started with an h. she was also very nice, and very good. the 17 year old loved her hair. she's been raving about it for 2 days now. she also cut the 13 year old boy's hair. it was exactly what his dad wanted him to get. it looked perfect! and then, my boy. a man cut his hair. he was not very friendly. i felt like i was an imposition. but he gets 5 stars anyways, because i honestly have never seen such a great cut on my son. his dad wanted him to cut off his long hair and i was really disappointed. his hair is blonde, so when it's short, it looks almost see-through. this guy did an amazzzzzing job and i could not be happier. all in all, i'm highly satisfied! definitely the new family spot."
"on a work trip i was hurried, harried and hairy. karla squeezed me in, sized up my hair and delivered a great haircut in 20 minutes while carrying an interesting conversation (unlike the head grabbers i've had who want you to play freeze and stop talking while they grunt and grimace). such a great experience thinking about scheduling work trips just to get my hair cut here!"
"i went in to get a different kind of haircut.  i know great clips doesn't do a lot of different styles, but those hair stylist went to school to learn all different types of styles.  they are looking to do more.  i got dominique.  she had a fun bubbly personality.  i really liked her.  we laughed a lot.  she was so excited to do something different.  she gets 5 stars.the location was super busy but i didn't wait at all.my hair came out somewhat of what i wanted.  short on one side, a little to short than what we discussed, but i'm not picky and i know my hair grows fast.  the other side i wanted to keep my long bangs.  my bangs could have been styled a little more over my ear.  i had to take some hair off when i got home cause it just didn't look right.  after i trimmed it more on the side with my long hair, it looked perfect.  it was a weird style and i wasn't expecting it to be perfect, but i had a wonderful fun experience."
"i have been a regular at this location for the past 3 years and would give it 5 stars.  however, i had one bad haircut last december that i am still trying to outgrow.  i asked for layers in the bottom inch of my hair and ended up getting layers 4 inches higher - does not look good on someone with thick natural wavy hair.  lucky for me, i have had several excellent stylists cut my hair since then and i have about 2 more visits to go before my hair is back to normal and the layers are where they should be.  my only request is that they change the opening hours to 8 or 8:30 am - i live and work nearby and prefer to go in the morning when there is less of a wait."
always a great experience when i go to this great clips. alejandra( alex) does an exceptional job at keeping my hair under control. i've been going weekly to her for a long time and plan on doing so. the rest of the staff here is great and will always go above and beyond to make you feel satisfied. will definitely be going back.
"i  walked in wed. morning and mitchell  took care of me immediately. i showed him a picture and he carefully started cutting my hair to exactly what i wanted. i asked him to shampoo it at the end and its just perfect. short,  textured and easy to wear.   too bad i live in sedona and will have to drive 2 hours for another cut.  next time im in phoenix for trader joes i will make an appointment with him."
this location likes to close 30 minutes early even when you check-in. checked in and showed up to find the store all locked up. classic great clips service.
"went in today, because according to superstition in my culture, if you cut your hair during full moon, your hair will grow back faster...so after waiting 6 months, i finally went for it. yes today is harvest moon, the best moon of the year, i think. walked in, two people ahead of me, i got checked in right away. wait time was 5 minutes because they were fully staffed. awesome. i get called, kristin i think was the name of the stylist. she wasn't too chatty, which i thought was great..she was totally chill, and i love my layered cut. thanks again great clips, see you in a year!"
"i've been here twice now, and it seems like a good place to get a haircut.  the online check-in makes it very convenient, and you can get in quickly.  dulce cut my hair and i got the best haircut i've had in a long time.  she was quick and efficient and an absolute pro.  i'll be back soon!"
this is the only place that i go to. the online check in works great. my wait time has always been minimal.  i have always had great experiences and i think ever is very talented. i always feel welcome and love when they remember my name and how i like my cut. i always feel great after leaving. i have never been disappointed.
"i've been going here for many years. but, now i am looking for another place to cut my hair.  why?  long ass waits- i checked in via their mobile app, which says, 56 mins.  i arrive 60 mins later and i am still waiting over 45 minutes to hit the chair.  this has happened 3 times in one month and the other two times i left before getting my haircut.  this location is always under staffed....seeking new barber."
"i was desperate for a cut and my usual spot is too far and i the wait would make me way late for my ride to palm springs. i called gc just after 9am and there was zero wait time. i lucked out because as soon as i got there the online check ins were adding in the queue. eddie took care of me. super nice, great cut and perfect timing. i even had time to get home to trim and dye my beard. i'll definitely be back. i really look sharp."
"great service and the online check in is very convenient to avoid waiting, a. figueroa is attentive and this is the second time he cuts my hair as i want"
just got one of the worst haircuts of my life from a girl named alex. had to go home and use my own clippers to cut away her terrible job! terrible! beware
right now they have the $7.99 haircut special which always is great for back to school. i've been coming here for at least two years with different family members. online check-in gets you in quicker. but everyone is very nice and courteous. brianna and edward have given us great haircuts.
"i had a great experience yesterday. i used the online check in system from my desk and headed straight over. it said i would have a 17 minute wait when i checked in, and once i got there i sat maybe 5 minutes.  my stylist was asked a lot of questions and he did a great job on my hair (hadn't been cut in almost a year...such is the life of a twin mom), and did a great blow out (took time, but it was so worth it) after with product so i could get back to work. i was gone from work a grand total of 61 minutes with travel.everyone commented on how great it looked when i got back (first time it wasn't pulled back in a clip for 4 months).will definitely go again."
"i've been coming here for the last year, as family members had been going for years before that. i've had my hair cut by numerous people here and they do a decent job. the quality ranges from good to excellent. if you go on line to make an appointment the wait isn't as long but there's still a wait. that's okay, as if i went to a place like this and there was no wait at all, i'd wonder why they don't have any customers. the cost is reasonable, they work with both genders well and so i'll continue being a customer. only suggestion is that i'd like to be able to make an appointment on line before they open, the site doesn't work until then."
"giving them 3 stars because i have had some great experiences here in the past. brianna, if you need a perm or even just a cut, is great and i wish i could continue to go back and see her, but, alas, i will never return after this last experience.i have had my hair permed twice at this location (both times by brianna, who i now trust with my hair...which is harder than trusting someone with your life) and 7 months since my last perm, the curls are mostly fallen out (it happens) and take a load of styling gel to look even semi-good most days. add on 4 inches of new growth and it was time to get a new perm. i had to have it done soon, preferably this weekend, because of a family trip next week so i called to make an appointment. brianna, i was told, was not going to be available until wednesday afternoon. i had some anxiety about having a stranger do my perm, but it had to be done. so i booked it. now let me make it clear. i had explained to the woman who booked my appointment  (with liz i believe was her name) that i had had my hair permed there 7 months ago, i needed a full perm because the curl was mostly gone, etc. i get there this morning and i'm told by the stylist that i have ""plenty of curl left"" (i'm not sure how to attach a picture, but trust me...that's not the case.) even though i let her know that this was my hair fresh from the shower and that had temporarily refreshed the curl. it would be gone once it dried. she then pulled on some strands of hair, towards the end of my hair, and claimed there was too much breakage. oh right, big surprise. i have at least an inch of split ends after 7 months, i'm lazy about getting trims and i needed one, but above that inch or so my hair is plenty strong. she requested a consult from management, who was very condescending towards me and barely listened to me at all. continuously talking over me and making claims about perms that are outdated and did not apply to my situation in any case.  if they didn't know have someone on staff for that day who was competent at performing perms, then they shouldn't have given me an appointment. now i have to make a new appointment at a private salon (where the price is, oddly enough, the same as at great clips) that will force me to take a vacation day at work before my trip. if they had simply told me they couldn't do the perm with their current staff i would have booked elsewhere in the first place and not wasted my morning."
just had my haircut from briana. it was horrible.  she did the haircut in 15 min. the fade and side burns were uneven. she did not texture the top and or use thinning shears like i asked her too. i will never go back.
"two stylists on friday evening. i've been waiting an hour while chatty kathy has managed to do 1 1/2 haircuts. the other stylist just had four friends walk in and he skipped one of them alllll the way to the head of the line. cute. too late for me to go anywhere else, so i'm going to keep waiting. smile nicely and let my tip reflect my aggravation."
"phoenix, az: just come here to see heber hernandez, if you can get him.  my hair is impossible to cut well and he knocked it out like it was nothing.  the guy should be charging $50 for picking up the shears."
"i am visiting from northern california and want to say how terrific ms. alex is. she gave me a wonderful cut, listened to all my idiosyncrasies about my hair, and was so cheerful and sweet the whole time. love my haircut! thanks alex."
late review... was here about 6 months ago. service was horrible i had my hair cut by cathy and she was unbelievably rough while washing. felt like she was hand washing a tough to remove stain from clothes and i left with a horrible neck ache. i would suggest talking less and being for caring for your customers. don't need to take a visit to the chiropractor after a hair. will not return to this location.
"went in close to closing time, was greeted almost immediately by one stylist and was given an accurate wait time. during my wait i was quickly hesitant to be taken by the woman that greeted me, no conversation and quick to cut before communicating with her customer. luckily i was taken by the other stylist, helen. she was upbeat and open to conversation, she worked well with my parameters because i'm growing out an awkward cut but wanted to clean it up. she walked me through her thoughts since i came in unprepared, kindly explained why her suggestions made more sense then what i was originally thinking & i'm glad i agreed! thanks again helen!"
"by far the worst great clips i've ever been to. i only go to these places for a quick fade or something simple since the service at some locations is mostly sub par to say the least. the woman that cut my hair had a terrible attitude from the start. every time i would move, scratch my face, check my phone, she would pull her hands from my head really fast and wait until i was done, like seriously? i'm hardly moving and you make it blatantly obvious and may be inconveniencing your job? psshh woman get off your high horse, you ain't hot and you have a terrible personality.i came in today. she was there. i signed in online and was next on the list. another patron came in and i was skipped for whatever reason. i didn't ask and just walked out. i'll be picking a different location next time."
"red flag: since great clips started allowing customers to sign in remotely via a smart phone, most of my friends have stopped going there. as a chronologically gifted group (seniors), most still have flip phones and when they arrive to sign in there are already too many people ahead of them (those with smart phones that have signed in via smartphone). also, walk-ins are at a disadvantage for the same reason. the cost of a senior hair cut has risen from $11 to $12.the cost of a hair cut does not include a shampoo (like fantastic sam's). my most recent visit resulted in an ok haircut, but a very rude hair stylist."
"always skeptical when it comes to trying out new places to get my haircut, but boy this great clips was perfect. the staff was extremely friendly, clean store, and almost no wait. my stylist, helen, was awesome. she was very attentive to all the little details and super personable/hilarious. will be back in 3-4 weeks!"
"after quite a few good experiences i went there again. this time it was very dissapointing, hairstylist helen was frustated, rude and is always in a hurry to finish the haircut. complete haircut took hardly less than 5 min, i hope she will treat the customers with respect from next time. ***never getting a haircut from helen again***"
"will never return - the lady was rude to me the whole time and i was just trying to be nice. i asked her about her day and she gave me an attitude the whole time. she rushed my hair, the back was uneven on one side and they pushed me out the door and then i went home and fixed my hair. honestly, spit on the window when you walk by and let everyone know how awful the service is."
"after a previous good experience i came back here, and i'm highly disappointed. i mentioned several times to helen that i wanted to keep the length on the top of my head, and she proceeded to chop more than half of it off. when i told her i was disappointed with how much she took off, she defended what she did instead of even trying to apologize. i doubt i will be back, and i sure as hell won't let her cut my hair, again, if i am."
"like all great clips, checking in online saves a lot of time. stylists are friendly and helpful. helen in particular does a great job. thank you!"
"cameron is amazing! i had a pretty bad experience the night before with a different stylist and didn't see how bad it was until the morning. i went back (on the verge of tears) and cameron fixed it so you couldn't even tell how much of a wreck it was when i came in. he was professional, personable, and very understanding. cameron is clearly very experienced and knows what he is doing--i am so grateful to have had him cut my hair!the reason i have to give this location 4 stars instead of 5 is because of my experience the night before with jeryll. i don't know how he got his cosmetology license, because it seems like he has never cut hair before. i didn't want anything fancy, i just needed 1 inch off of my layers and a bang trim. when i left, there were no layers on one side because it was so choppy, and on the other side the front half of my hair was just below ear length and the back half was a couple inches below shoulder length. my bangs were uneven and were not the same length. i couldn't believe that anyone could cut hair so poorly with their cosmetology license. despite this, i won't judge the location based on one stylist. everyone else was professional and welcoming. as long as you get the right person, you will have a great experience. ask for cameron! he's very talented, and i plan on returning to see him in the future."
i took my daughter in for her first big girl haircut this afternoon. we called ahead and asked for the person most best suited for dealing with a rambunctious three-year-old and was quickly told rosie was the best. that recommendation could not have been more spot-on. she was fantastic and understanding what i wanted and was so sweet to my daughter. her hair came out fantastic and we will definitely return.
"i have been a long time customer of this location and they have always treated us like family.  i shave my own head now, but still come here to have my boys  hair cut.  quick, quality and low cost."
"i just love cindy. she gives me a great haircut short and easy to style. i used to go to expensive salons thinking i would get better and style and service because i was paying a premium, but my experience at this great clips location is by far the best i have gotten and cindy is so personable amd friendly i look forward to my next visit"
"i had a decent hair cut, but very poor customer service. i was insulted the entire time about my hair care. will not be returning."
"came here because reygan works here.  she gives great, honest advise when you really don't  know how your hair will look best.   she considers how much time you are really willing to spend on your hair each morning.  really pleased with my haircut."
"not every experience was like mine i'm sure. i've had plenty of good haircuts here but after the last, i'll be finding a new spot."
"i've been here several times, being a former asu kid and never quite moving out of tempe.  they have great deals - those $7.99 sales (i feel like i've achieved crazy coupon lady status whenever i chance upon these), and the convenience of checking in on their website so that you can minimize your wait in-store.i had long-ish (about mid-back) layered hair and just yesterday cut it into a long bob and i love it.  the lady (alicia, i think) was a perfectionist and gave me wonderful advice on how to style my hair.  for instance, how i could hide the fact that my bangs were framing my face - something typical for layers, but not quite advisable for bobs, and how to get rid of those ugly duck tail edges, since it's at that awkward length where your hair follows the curve of your neck.taking off a star because my boyfriend's hair wasn't quite as stellar as mine, having his hair trimmed by somebody who literally graduated from cosmetology school a week ago.  there were several long strands that were missed and cause i am a little ocd, it took a tremendous amount of restraint on my part from plucking off those strands before we reached home and i could find a pair scissors."
my favorite spot. the service is always good. the staff is super friendly and i have not had a bad cut yet. being able to check in online through their app is perfect!  quick in and out.
"for a quick, inexpensive haircut, great clips is my choice location. their mobile app is excellent for finding one nearby (yelp is good too!), and getting checked in ahead of time. i've been able to walk right in and get seated without waiting around for my name to be called. it feels like you're cheating the system, but all is fair in love and haircuttery. the price for a haircut here is cheaper than many others and competes with supercuts. all said and done, i can leave with my ears lowered for under $17 bucks including tax and tip. the stylists at this location are really friendly and make for an enjoyable experience. to get your money's worth (and avoid those stray itchy hairs all over your neck), ask them to rinse your hair and add a little product before you leave. it's easy and makes you look presentable if you're going back to work or a social affair. though you're not going to get all the same attention to detail of an upscale barber, sometimes all your head needs is some routine maintenance."
"i love this place! i'm never disappointed with anyone i have cutting my hair. it's just as good as going to a salon (believe me or don't, but i've never had a bad experience here like other great clips.) but today i had rosie, and she was so sweet! you could tell it was hectic in there because of the $7.99 deal, but she was still calm and polite. also, rosie was very caring for my hair, did a great job, and was so kind and helpful! definitely coming back to see her again soon."
"i would give zero if i could. their check-in online system means nothing, twice i've been here, checked in and they just take whoever they want in whatever order. bring it to their attention and they offer no apology.  i won't be back."
"i tried great clips on a whim since i was shopping in the complex where it's located. my first haircut was a nice change for me, but it was just a blunt cut without much style. the stylist was adequate.but a few months later i had a coupon and decided to try another stylist there. i was introduced to robin, an extremely experienced stylist. she literally transformed my hair! she cut it short and sassy, but with a lot of design and style. i loved it! so easy to maintain the new style too.robin is a very fashionable, beautiful blonde so hard to miss! i now only go to her. i'm from san francisco where a cut and style run from $89-120 no joke. i've been to some of the top salons in phoenix and scottsdale (when i've been able to afford it) and my tab for cut, color, style has been at least $100. robin's skills and the results i get to enjoy are as good as the top salon stylists i've been to. everyone compliments me. i can do different things with the hairstyle. if the long bangs start to get hard to style she will do a bang cut for a reduced fee. i always tip $10 and should really show even more respect for her skills with a higher tip.if you want to look like you just stepped out of the most chic salon with an incredible cut, go see robin! what a find."
"just walked in literally 6pm on the dot. she turned me away and said, ""we close at 6."" wow. well, if your going to turn into a pumpkin, you should have locked the doors.  wouldn't want you to go above and beyond by any means. last time i ever go here! unbelievable."
"after fighting my 5 year old son's request to cut his adorable long locks for quite some time, i had a weak moment on a saturday afternoon in march... i had both of my kids with me after a trip to the target in this shopping center, and i made a pit stop at this great clips location to see what kind of wait there was to get in.  to my surprise, i learned that there was not a wait and that regina could get my son in right away.  i was hesitant already to trust a stranger with my child's first haircut (outside of the trims he'd gotten from a family member previously).  i swear - i had butterflies in my stomach as my daughter and i watched... i was also nervous about how my son would do sitting in a big chair, sitting still for the cut and the shave, etc... but he did great!we requested a mohawk and i showed regina some images of what i had in mind.  she told me we should go the fauxhawk route instead and suggested the ideal length so that when we didn't style it, it would still look decent... she did her thing and my son has gotten a ton of compliments ever since!i was upsold on some gel for the fauxhawk, so we walked out the door 20 minutes or so later with a clean cut and very excited kid plus a firm hold gel for $21.85 + tip.  as we drove home, my daughter requested a mohawk also... ""no honey,"" i said.  i think it will be a long time if ever before i let that happen!i had low expectations of great clips, but they definitely delivered and i'd return for a fauxhawk clean up in a heartbeat!"
"when you find your person, it is horrible when they leave or you move away. i moved to phoenix and had a lot of anxiety about finding a new place to get my hair cut for a cheap price. i came here because it's down the street from my place and great clips has good pricing for cuts. i'm happy to say on my first go, i found my new person. louisa is amazing. she is very good about listening to what you want and checking with you continuously to make sure it's what you were asking for. she is great and i'm glad i found her. 5 stars for louisa!! as for the actual store, it feels a little chaotic in there and the bathroom was a little dirty. i guess aim for slower times and if it's really don't use the bathroom."
"had to redo  worst haircut ever ,had to do it three  time,they can't cut hair,and the first time i went the woman added 2 dollars to her tip -5  they practical y shaved my head even it  out thanks******* s"
"i go to the great clips at 44th st and e thomas rd in phoenix az.  when holly cuts my hair, it's always the highest quality. holly listens to what is requested and is very professional.  the last 2 times she was not available so i took my chances with the stylist available.  big mistake.  last month my haircut was uneven, but i accepted that and tried to trim it up myself at home. today was a different matter altogether.  while the stylist was very courteous and friendly, he clearly did not listen to me and left me looking like a shaved freak.  i asked for a trim and told him how i wanted my hair to ""layer and feather"".  i specifically told him that i did not want a short/shaved/spiked haircut.  i told him that i used to wear my hair short over 10 years ago, and how i certainly do not want that now.  i am mortified with the freakishly short ""ostrich"" haircut i have.  i told him i wanted my hear to feather.  a crew cut cannot feather.  when i asked him to not leave a ""tail"" on my neck, he completely shaved the back of my head over an inch above my hair line.   i specifically went in to get a professional trim prior to a very important job interview.  i am a professional person in a professional position and i am also a senior citizen.  this haircut is not only offensive, it makes me look like i am mocking administration.  i look completely unacceptable because of great clip's circus haircut.  this is the most embarrassing appearance i have ever had, at a time when i need to look highly professional.   i even cancelled a plane ticket as i just cannot be seen by my family looking this freakish, unprofessional, and offensive."
"quality haircuts at a bargain price. if you're nervous, ask for gladys or nicholas. both of them are great at their jobs and take the time to produce the results that you ask for."
"they stole money from me. so check this out. i went to get a haircut, i liked it. it was a great haircut. i pay, i tip, i sign. apparently i didn't tip enough. the guy rounded what was a total of $16 to $18. sure it's only $2 but that guy straight up stole from me. who does that?? that is so unprofessional! never going back there again. that's just terrible. congrats guys, you hired a thief."
"nope. my small son has autism, and doesn't like hair on his clothing (sensory). we normally love great clips for being so flexible, when we attend the facility off cactus road we have experience excellent and kind service. however, at this arcadia shop, an elderly blonde mutton-dressed-as-lamb gave us static for removing his shirt. holy crap, a five-year old's nipples might show before we put the cape on? we whipped his shirt back on an left, to the apologies of the rest of the staff. someone should fire that one for being so insensitive to handicapped children."
"first time visiting a hair salon in years. i used the app to check in early. robin cut my hair. she is very professional and friendly. she asked me what i wanted and i got it. i will definitely recommend her to my other friends and will be returning in the future. if you get lost trying to find it, it is kind of hidden near fry's."
"anabel gives a great shampoo.  it was exactly the temperature i requested, and she made my head feel fantastic!  she also gave me a great cut in relatively short amount of time ( a serious bonus for me) and when i asked her if she minded if i didn't talk, she was impeccably polite.imho, she should be working for a place that pays better than great clips, but i am grateful that she was there at great clips!"
"i have been here a few times and have never had an issue , went yesterday for a quick hair cut and she completely butchered my hair!! i asked for a short hair cut which i showed her a picture of what i kind of wanted....instead she just cut the back of the head in the middle super short and left the rest long! nothing like the picture i showed her! i went to another location today to get it fixed( even tho i didn't want to step foot into another great clips) and the guy was super nice about fixing my hair for free.. he said it looked as if it was in a pony tail and she just cut my pony tail off! which is exactly what it looked like, he fixed my hair the best he could but sadly even tho he fixed it the back of my hair is super short and my hair line is a triangle so it's a large triangle ! i know hair grows back but it is so upsetting that this happened!"
"i want to specify i am leaving this review for this location, not the chain as a whole.i'm really bummed to have to leave such a negative review, but i'm hoping this is read from someone who is in a position to do something about it and can take it as constructive criticism. ok, onto the rating...a little recap of my experience...i checked into this great clips using my online app. i don't normally visit this location, but i was in the neighborhood visiting my parents and was hoping to squeeze it into my work lunch hour. i saw my check-in time as a 17 min wait and figured that was okay because by the time i drove there i'd be able to get in pretty quickly thereafter....wrong. i arrived and was not greeted at the door, so i was never counted as being, ""checked in."" the wait list appeared on a monitor and showed i was 3rd in line. ok i thought--there's several people working hopefully this shouldn't take too much longer if i'm 3rd...even though by this point according to the app i should have been up. i let it slide because really, what can i do about it? the problem i have here is that i, like many people who use the app, rely on these estimated wait times because we are trying to fit it into our work schedules, lives, all of us are busy....but for a company that prides itself on getting people in and out conveniently for this not to be accurate--there's a problem. now like i said above, this review really isn't supposed to be about the company, but rather the location. up until this point, most of my check-in's have been fairly accurate with other locations, so i don't know who's to blame here.... so i sat and waited, one person called off the list (awesome, only 2 in front of me) another one called who was not there (ok...i should be next!) but then the person under me on that list was called! what?! so i stood up and informed the gal working at the front that i was an online check-in and that i hadn't been accounted for yet because no one had greeted me, but that i was there and ready. she had me write my name and phone number down. why? i have no clue because i was an online check-in that shouldn't matter...but whatever. so i did anyway, and yet the man behind me was still called, despite the fact i was in front of him. ok....i thought, starting to feel annoyed...it's fine--surely i'm next. i sat and watched the clock, knowing that if i wasn't called within 10 minutes, i'd probably not have enough time to get my hair cut and get back to work on time. so i waited, and waited...almost 10 minutes passed and a girl was called who wasn't even on the wait list. i then waited some more and then, the final icing on the cake, some mans name from the bottom of the list made it on top of mine. are you kidding me?! so now, i was over 20 minutes waiting (on top of the already aforementioned 17 minutes) and now not even next...i walked out, disappointed and frustrated having used up all my lunch time and haircut-less. there are several things disturbing about this: 1) the lack of acknowledgment when i walked in the door resulting in me not being ""checked in"" even though i was and had been waiting and someone moving ahead me on the list but also 2) then several other people were moved in front of me on top of my 3) already long wait time that exceeded what the app had predicted. i don't know if this is a management issue, the app, or a heinous concoction of the both...but i sure hope they pull it together."
"i believe her name is shannon or sharon not quite sure but if you can avoid her do so by all means she extremely rude. i should of known that by the way she checked me in typically you walk in they check you in asap i come in and wait at the counter for 2 minutes or so after she greets me waiting for her to check me in once checked in she tells me it'll be a moment or two so take a seat. after she cleans her area i'm called up next during the haircut she ask me what i do after telling her i work for a financial firm i can see her roll her eyes in the mirror. after a few minutes into the haircut i request she doesn't shave my beard jokingly i say for insulation purposes she follows up by asking if i want the hair in my ear shaved or should she leave it for insulation purposes. i also requested to not trim the hair on top of just the back and sides, did she listen? of course not. the absolute worse haircut i've had at this establishment."
"neat! i got my hair washed here almost two weeks ago. yes, it's come to that. i have people wash it for me. (it's eeeeassier when you're on walking sticks.) i figured, ""hey, six bucks. why not?""i walked in (ha), my taxi driver left .... and *then* i learned, on a chilly fall day, that blow drying my hair would run $45. (my hair goes past my shoulders.) i didn't want it styled. just dry. as in ""not sopping wet"". i figured i would have to pay another ten bucks or so. but not a full blow out price. i also was not in need (or have any interest) in getting a hair cut here.asking to self blow dry (an option back home in new york) was also a no. i was told to hold a blow dryer in a salon requires a license.ooook.all was not lost however. the nice ladies here later realized my predicament and worked me a favor. they let me sit under the big old air dryer. the kind you use when you're getting highlights. that was pretty sweet!i have to say my hair wash was one of the most luxurious washes i've had in ages. so much so i purchased the shampoo/conditioner.i didn't catch the name of the super duper woman who washed my hair. but she's a doll. pixie hair cut. blond. nicest woman ever!"
extremely unfriendly. i came in for a very simple buzz cut and asked one question to go over a certain area of my head and she gave me a hard time. this place is only good for getting in fast. i won't be coming back to this location.
"these girls that work there are so bitchy. they were so mean to my son. so unwelcoming! i will never ever bring my family there again! i thought they can manage a trim, a fade. it's not some high fashion salon! it's a cheap hair cut place! these girls need to go back to cosmotology!"
"my stylist was very knowledgeable. yay, 13$/haircut!  she even knew about my natural curls & told me how that would work w/haircuts i wanted. thanks!"
"with all the negative reviews on yelp about this location, i have to admit i went in expecting to not even be acknowledged even though the on line check in stated no waiting time @ 2p on a wednesday. but to my surprise, a friendly face did greet me as soon as i walked in. she chopped my hair exactly how i wanted it. my chunky over grown home slashed bangs were no longer a mess and soon my one length hair was styled beautifully with layers. i am 6"" lighter and loving it. i would definitely come back without hesitation."
"unless you get holly to cut your hair avoid this location at all cost. she seems to be the only person in the entire place that understands she is supposed to listen to what the customer wants. i recently got my haircut there from someone other than holly and was absolutely butchered, easily the worst haircut of my life. not only did the ""stylist"" not listen to what i wanted but she was borderline argumentative. in short, if you walk into this location looking to get a haircut and holly isn't there, just turn around and walk out."
"my hair was an absolute mess, but stylist xc____ saved the day.after very quick service to check in, without having to create an annoying 'profile,' stylist xc____ carefully listened to what i was looking for (a thorough trim, not full cut), then she carefully combed out my hair, carefully plaited it in sections, slowly and carefully cut it, and then tripled checked to make sure the sides matched, while asking me if everything looked good. i would definitely go back. extremely reasonable price allows for well-earned tip. great location on mill ave. and very close to asu tempe campus."
"just left the shop and i am so happy i chose to walk in today. this was my first visit to the salon, as well as my first haircut from a new stylist in years. i was not really sure what i wanted, but i had a very talented stylist named joy who knew just how to cut my hair! i am so excited about my new haircut, and i am so impressed by the quality of service i received in such a short visit. my usual haircuts can take as long as two hours, but joy was very knowledgeable about my hair type and i was able to get an excellent cut in under half an hour. it is worth noting again that the haircut was amazing and i am loving my new do! i will definitely be back for another haircut soon."
if you want the best haircut please go see melissa....she is awesome and she always does an amazing job.
just left this place and i have to say that the lady who cut my hair was the rudest most unpleasant ever!!! its ok though because she saved me 6 bucks in tip.
"i've been getting my hair cut at great clips for some time. they're cheap and usually do a good job. one thing that has always bothered me however, is their massive indoor air pollution problem. the second you step into the place, you're assaulted by the nauseating, concentrated odor of toxic hair chemicals in their air. it smells like someone just emptied the major part of a hairspray bottle into the air.great clips seems to have no effective or no air filtration system at all. i think what they're spraying just gets recycled through the ac. this is true for all their locations in tempe, not just the one at mill and southern.for people with allergies and asthma like myself, this is no small problem, and today i've decided that i've had enough, and will no longer be a great clips customer. i instead got my hair cut at keep it cut at rural and baseline, where the air is actually breathable."
i always get the results i want here.  melisa always does a great job!  they greet me with a smile and welcome when i walk in.  i recommend them to my family and they all come to this location.
"this place is hit or miss.  i would never have my hair cut at a great clips (i have naturally curly hair, but even if i didn't....no, sorry) so this may skew my review a bit, simply because i have never seen quality work consistently come out of any great clips and would never trust them with my hair.  my husband, on the other hand, favors this place only because they are cheap.  his hair grows quickly, so if he doesn't like it, it won't matter in a few days anyway.  i keep trying to talk him out of going there every time and spend money on a place that will actually do a good job, but he insists on going back because he refuses to spend $10 more.  there was one young lady who is impossibly thin (i didn't catch her name.  she has big pretty eyes and is very thin) that cut his hair and did an absolutely terrible job.  every time he looked in the mirror, my totally not self-conscious husband would say ""worst haircut ever.  that chick messed my hair up.""  if he complains, it's bad."
"okay, this is a long story...but joy is amazing! go this location of great clips and ask for joy. she is 100% amazing in every aspect. first off, she's beyond friendly and cares about every person that steps in her salon. she realizes that haircuts are important to people and ultimately illustrates how they personally see themselves. long story short, i had my haircut done a while back and i knew what i wanted, but i did not have someone near as great as joy. i felt very unhappy about my experience and knew right away i needed to go back to joy. i showed her a pic of what i wanted done and she went above and beyond my expectations. i feel so more confident and back on the top after seeing her. one million percent, got to joy! thanks joy and great clips! mill and southern location"
"asked for a low fade, got a high fade. looks like i'm about to re-enlist now. the haircut was clean and no uneven lines. just not at all what i asked for. staff was friendly, checked in online and wait was only a couple minutes."
"i've gone to several great clips locations, and have had great experiences-- this was not one of them. i went in today asking for a half inch trim-- the first thing my stylist does is try to get me to buy some product. i respectfully listen, but she spends more time talking about the product, rather than focusing on my hair. i had to point out that she left half of my hair untrimmed and longer than the rest. she didn't even check my part, did a half-assed job, and continued to talk about buying the product. some advice-- please don't spend the whole appointment trying to get customers to buy product while paying little to no attention to the actual haircut. i will never be returning to this location again."
"never had any problems with this location. like all great clips you're really rolling the dice if you decide to walk in and expect a quick haircut. wait times can get long quickly, so always check in online or with the mobile app. in my experience great clips can be hit or miss from location to location and this is definitely one of the better ones. i'll drive several miles out of my way and past other locations to get my haircut at this location. i always seem to regret it when i don't."
"stephan went above and beyond. he took the time to discuss what i wanted, and made excellent suggestions. the result of my visit was the best haircut of my life, and for only $8 (during the sale). i wasn't sure what i wanted, but afterwards ended up with something i didn't know i could have asked for. highly recommended. stephan is my new spirit animal."
been here twice since living in tempe and im just gonna say i rather get my hair cut here than a fancy salon. every time i come here to get a hair cut they always leave my hair looking great. i just got it cut about three weeks ago and the person who cut my hair was amazing. he asked me how i liked to style it and even added personal touches the style i asked for.i cant remember his name but i will go back to him when i need a trim.
i just had my hair cut my michael at the great clips on mill. he did a great job and was super professional. he definitely understands how to cut short hair for women!
"of course it depends on who you get, but my husband and i deal with the best at this salon. daisy sure knows how to work a cute short hair do. i am far from being a picky person about my hair, but i did have something in mind. and she did a perfect cut. everyone loves my hair. i went from long to short. thanks daisy! now my husband goes to heather and has been going to her for years. i love this team of ladies cause they sure make us both look good. ;)"
great place !!!! bonnie was amazing!!! def would go back!!! very clean and professional !!!!and fast !!!
"i've been a returning customer of great clips consistently for about 2 years for a reason. when looking for a hair cut i like to be in and out and their online check in makes that possible, love walking in and skipping ahead of everyone waiting!  also i went here to get my hair styled for my engagement pictures and daisy did a wonderful job!  who knew?!"
"i have been coming to this great clips for over 3 years, before, i was going to the great clips on 24th street and baseline for bridgette. when she moved stores, i decided to make that extra commute to get my hair cut by her. i highly recommend asking for bridgette, she has spent time perfecting her skills. bridgette have been going beyond my expectations of great clips and this is the only reason why i go to this location. please give her a try, she will spend time learning about you, instead of the typical 15 minutes haircut where you are left feeling awkward wondering who cut your hair. you won't be disappointed!"
"hey i goto great clips all the time - in fact the same person just recently cut my hair for when i asked my girlfriends parents for their daughter's hand, for my engagement, for my wedding and fixed what the wife tried to do.  always very kind, relaxing experience. and always a good haircut."
"i have gone here several times to get a men's hair cut here, nothing complicated. however, the two times i have had my hair cut by the older woman i have ended up with an awful hair cut. after getting home and showering, the top of my head was left at the same length it was before (about an inch difference) and the angles from the transitions on the sides of my head were completely different.if you go here, get one of the younger ladies to cut your hair, they are more competent and i've never had issues with their work."
"walked in about 2 weeks ago, only had to wait 10 minutes.was lucky & got sandra, she did a fantastic job & knew what needed to be trimmed to get style i wanted before i even asked. turns out we had a lot in common & loved talking with her! she did a great haircut & am definitely going back to her in future!"
came to get a haircut at this location and left with uneven hair. the stylist didn't seem to know what he was doing at all. i immediately went to the great clips at hayden plaza and they did a wonderful job and didn't even charge me since my hair looked terrible. i decided to come back to get a refund and was told they wouldn't do that because i should've had it re-done at the location that did a terrible job on my hair. i wouldn't recommend coming here.
"i checked in online at this location on a saturday afternoon. there was no wait and i only needed my hair shampooed and blow dried. when i arrived, there was only one customer at a station and 3 other stylists without clients. when i requested my service, the manager said, no - only hair cuts today! whaaaat? i thought it was a joke, but was quickly informed that it was not. they would not shampoo and dry or style my hair because they did not have ""enough stylists on the floor"" * possibly the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard of! * absolutely the poorest customer service i have ever had at a great clips! or anywhere actually i went to my car and drove to the great clips at squaw peak plaza on 16th st where i was greeted by susan. this location appeared to be busy and only had 2 stylists on the floor. susan did not bat an eye and was happy to have me as her customer. she did a fantastic job and was a pleasure to work with! i would encourage you to save yourself the trip and aggravation and skip great clips located at 4312 e. cactus in phoenix and head straight over to the great clips at 6825 n 16th st, phoenix.  you will receive much better service and enjoy the experience. i wish i could let the cactus store know that i bought $100 worth of product and tipped 25%. just sayin'"
"i was a walk in.  started my experience with two hairstylist debating (in front of me during check-in) on who had the right to do the cut. guess i should have walked out right then!  explain to the hairstylist over 3 times- how my hair needed to stay in a ponytail (rubber); since it was going to be donated.  3-5 times later she finally paid attention/understood; after removing the river band and trying to come out the hair. never had clippers used to shave off a ponytail before. will never have it done again!! nora don't understand how a hairdresser, does not realize wet here is one length compared to dry hair.  besides-the underneath/back hair is now shorter than the top/sides. also-ended up being shorter than what i request.  since the ponytail was not cut straight, the stylist had to trim it up. again-too short!!!!will not return to that stylist, maybe even that location. beware before you sit down!!!!"
took my 4 year old son in this evening. we did the mobile check in which worked out perfectly. wade cut my son's hair and did a good job! he knew what to do & was good with talking to my son. enjoyable experience! thank you!
always bring my grandchildren here. great cut and very reasonable prices would recommend this place for good hair cuts.
"the national weather service issued excessive heat warning's for sunday and monday saying that temperatures on the sidewalks and streets could get up to 170°   right now great clips has this man working on a street corner. on a day where people are supposed to avoid going outside if possible is it really necessary to put an older gentlemans health at risk by having him stand out in this for hours?the city of phoenix and churches are setting up shelters and the power company is putting on extra workers to make sure everybody has air. considering all of this, wouldn't it behoove the company to think of a persons health before advertising that may not even bring in more income?"
"two bad experiences with chelsey. first time she told me i was second in line when i was was fifth. today she argued with me about my cut/style. she spent maybe 5 minutes on the cut. its uneven and the worst i've ever had. she pressed the clippers in to my neck, leaving burns and red streaks. this person has no business working with the public and should never be allowed near a salon. i called the customer comment line and the box was full. obviously, i won't be back."
"i've come to this location for years as has my family. they have several good stylists. but the fact that the owner, randy, won't  fix the hot water heater is absurd. it's been broken for months!!! so do not ask for a shampoo unless you want to have a shampoo with very cold water. everyone's shampoos should be free until this is corrected. he owns multiple locations and this is ridiculous that he is making both his customers and employees suffer through cold water. stop being cheap!!!"
"horrible service. i came in for a blow dry and it looked like the stylist definitely did not know what she was doing. normally, it would take close to 45 mins to do a decent job. i was there for one and a half hour with absolutely no results. she even asked her colleague to help and she tried to style my hair completely straight. on being asked for feedback, when i politely said this isn't what i was expecting...she snapped back at me saying i should know the weather is humid. the lady was extremely rude and i think it was a total rip off. i would never go there again and stay away from such unpleasant staff."
ask for chelsey especially if you have a child with autism or special needs. she's been cutting my hair since she was 18 and is the only one who can cut my sons hair. she's got a great sense of style.
"hands down, the worst experience i have ever had with getting a haircut.  i live between two great clips of about equal distance so i alternate back and forth.  the notes are the same, as i get the same boring, and very easy haircut.  i have been getting the same cut since about 2009.  yesterday, i knew i was in trouble when i had to explain 3-4 times what the notes meant before the guy even started.  i understand that new people start, but they need to have their skills tested before hacking up customers.  the guy just couldn't understand what i was telling him, it was a joke.  other stylists could see what was going on, and one even tried to come over and help.  i think that others seeing how bad he was doing and not intervening made the situation worse.i finally just told him to stop, i couldn't take any more.  i will get it fixed elsewhere.  he really didn't understand he was doing so bad.  the same girl that tried to help came and told him to apologize to me and offer me some product.  he made some half assed apology, truly not understanding there was an issue, and then offered 50% off one little bottle of shampoo.  he also couldn't figure out how to ring me out.  i just gave money and left, again, there was no way i was waiting around there any longer.  too bad, i usually get really good treatment here, but i won't ever go back now."
ask for jeniffer. she pays attention to detail and make your hair look the way you want. she did a really good job
"it seems that the person cutting hair does not listen. as a female, i am given a man's cut.as i am waiting, i have seen more time taken cutting a man's hair. my last visit maria hadno regard for my request. uneven cut. i will find another shop that will listen to my request.you can't grow hair back after the damage has been done."
"i love this place. in and out quick. the staff is really friendly. ask for chad, a master at work:)"
"i take my children to great clips.  on this particular visit, we arrived around 8pm, and were informed of a short wait.  we waited about 10 minutes before the first daughter was called back for her wash and cut.within another 10 minutes, the other daughter went back.  both were given personalized attention and enjoyed the scalp massage with the shampoo.both haircuts came out fine, symmetrical, etc.  friendly and efficient hair cutters.  price for 2 cuts, including shampoo and tip:  $34.00  ~~ and the girls were happy with the results.we will return to this location."
been getting my hair cut by one of the girls here for years.   jennifer does a great  job.   i love her.
"i called this location to see what their wait time was and the woman who answered, angie, informed me that there was no one there and to come in. i asked to put my name in and she stayed that it wasn't necessary. i asked her again and she insisted that i didn't need to. i drove the 4 minute drive from my location to this great clips and when i arrived every seat was full and there was a 35 minute wait. i mentioned that i had just spoke with someone and asked to put my name in and every person acted oblivious. no apology whatsoever, horrible customer service."
"not so great clip.... from my experience.  i'm not going to write a book about it, but the service is okay, the workers are disgruntled (bad ownership from what they said), but my biggest pet-peeve, the stations are covered with hair and they didn't clean up prior to me being seated.  i had to ask her to clean up."
"non-existent customer service. quite literally. i walk up to the desk, the guy working there ignores up - i'm standing at the counter inches from where he just finished ringing up a customer - when i get to the counter, he turns away from me and walks away. walks. away. from. a. customer. like i have cooties or  something. wtf? i'll go elsewhere for my haircut."
"i've been coming to this great clips for several years for haircuts. they're quick and pretty much always do a good job. sure, i've had a person every now and then that wasn't all that great, but i've never had anyone completely butcher my hair. all the hairdressers are friendly.i always check in on the app when i come in (they don't take reservations) and i never have to wait more than about 10 mins when i arrive. at $14 a haircut they're pretty reasonable to begin with, but they offer deals a few times throughout the year & are always mailing out coupons."
"very nice people, clean and professional. get a decent haircut for a decent price and don't spend all day in the salon."
"they are always in a rush to finish my haircut within ten minutes. every single time they fail to cut my hair how i ask them.  i ask them for a fade, they cut it all one length. i ask them for a disconnect, they literally just didnt do it then insisted they did. cuts have been uneven and sloppy, consistently!  i have gone to a different person each time snd still get terrible service. the customer service and professionalism just isnt there. on top of that i have always been a great tipper.  i have tipped between 30% and 50 % for sub par results.  i have gone here about 100 times in the past few years but this time is definitely my last."
"juanita was amazing. i apologize for not remembering the lady who was going to do my hair. but, i give her kudos for admitting she was hesitant about doing my hair. i have a lotttt so i don't blame her. juanita stepped up and did fabulous! before and after"
this place is terrible. the only positive is that it opens early on the weekends for morning birds like me but i will never come back to this place because of the terrible cut i got.
"coleen had good reviews.. took a chance.. i said to her if she knew how to cut the style i wanted, said was familiar.. said she was a stylist for 9 years.  did the typical men's cut as they are known for.. uneven cut, 1/2inch on the top..never ever to to any great clips again.. does great job on men's hair..did not check in on web site... i had 3 people ahead of me. waited well over a hour..."
"giving 3 stars here kind of sucks for me. i am torn. i do like a lot of the stylists i have used. i just had one situation where i felt like they pushed product on me and then when i went to return it the return policy is that they send you a check in the mail 4-6 weeks later......whaaat? how about i paid with a credit card, put it back on that.i'll be back, but only for a cut:)"
"just had the best haircut experience of my life thanks to bailey. i am 57 with frizzy blonde hair. she cut and styled it too look like something out of a magazine. she did the styling part while i was turned to the side, so i wasn't sure what i was going to see when spun around. i literally dropped my jaw when she turned me to look at my hair. she is very talented and i had no idea my hair could look so great. plus she is great fun to talk to.!"
they did a great job not sure why ppl are blasting them on yelp specially if your going to a wedding and you talk about how great your hair is
just got a cut from gabriella and she did a fantastic job. she actually listens and follows through with a great cut. i love it thank you gabriella! i will be back
"wow i cannot even believe this place. words can not even express my anger. i went in to get a little trim 2 months before my wedding i was not looking for a new look i was just wanting a little maintenance. my hair stylist knew my goals. i have a long beautiful hair that goes all the way down my back and jeffrey took it upon himself to chop off 5 inches and cropped it just below my shoulders. i am devisisted. i should have known just from looking at him that i was gonna be in trouble. never trust a hairdresser that has a funky haircut. they all think they're artist and they all think they know best & do whatever they want even if you don't agree with it. i took my concern to the manager colleen but she treated me even worse. she was completely condescending and rude. ""yes mrs, i will refund your $14"" even though i spend $100 on the service and no amount of money can buy me my hair back before my big day."
i came here with average expectations but needed a haircut fast.  i waited less than 15 minutes and florentina was my stylist.  she was amazing.  my hair was a mess and i showed her a photo of the style i wanted and it was exactly the same as the photo.  would definitely come back!  the price is great too!
just needed a trim and bailey was quick and efficient. also gave me tips for my dry scalp. thank you!!
i've been coming here for about a year now and i'm always happy with their quality of work and professional.  flo gave my son and i excellent hair cut on wednesday.  we will both be sure to request her in the future.
"went in on a recommendation from someone whose haircut i complimented, and i'm so glad i did! lance did a great job of cutting off my shoulder length hair...love my new pixie cut. (i was also observing flo and she looks very good as well.)"
"if you've never been to a great clips, be sure to get someone's attention before assuming your in line by sitting down, like any other barbershop.after waiting 15 minutes, i realized you have to sign up with your phone and address before your ""in line"".so after doing so, they decide to help someone who came in after me. walked out. never going to this chain clip shop again."
"my hair cut is great! down side? my hair stylist was very aggressive. she shampooed and conditioned my hair, it felt as i if she was trying to rip my scalp off then wash my hair....."
"fast, friendly and affordable. i have thick hair that's layered and juanita always does a great job and my hair moves & falls just right. ray used to cut my hair but he's no longer there, he did magic with his shears! i love the online check in! they always cut your hair exactly as you asked. highly recommend!!"
i am back in az and need my hair cut...three weeks ago.  danielle did such a fabulous haircut for me that i decided to wait it out.  i want my hair cut today but i will have to wait until tomorrow because she is not in today. hope she has a great day off and stays cool!
"need a quick haircut? stop by and someone will seat you within minutes. i always ask for the manager, colleen because she does a great job.i just read youri's comment about the app and looked it up on my phone. the app is called great clips online check in. use it to add your name to the list so that you have the chance of being next when you arrive. love it!"
"i really only get my hair cut once a year, but everytime i come here they're incredibly friendly. prices aren't bad, standard of your chain hair salons."
this place is very conveniently located to me so i've gone there a few times since they've opened.  they seem to have a high rate of employee turnover there so it's hard to get the same person more than once.  i've also had to go to another location to get my cut fixed on two separate occasions.
i checked in on line and when i walked in i was 1 on the screen. a man was checking in in person so he was 2 on the screen. adela tells me that the man was next since he checked in before me (the screen clearly showed him as 2). so what's the point of the on line check in if it's not being followed. very upsetting and she obviously doesn't know how to read a screen!
"just returned from a first time visit to great clips on nacogdoches where my sister and i both dropped in for a cut.  having recently moved from oregon where the same person cut my hair for the last 10 years, i was nervous about trying out someone new.  relax!  lane was my stylist and he gave me as good a cut as i ever received in my nyc days or my portland, or days!  i was absolutely thrilled with the job he did and made sure that he knew that both verbally and with a tip.  similarly, my sister was exceptionally happy with the job jennifer did on her.  recognizing that hair stylists may come and go with uncommon frequency, i would proudly recommend lane to anyone looking for a professional experience at an unbelievably reasonable cost.  thank you lane!  will see you soon."
"great place, great staff, great haircut ! definitely coming back ! the staff listened to what i wanted and the wait was low."
went there to get a haircut saw they informed me the wait would be awhile.i had to be on the way to work in a hour.left to stop and get something at another store thought to myself okay i killed some time let me go back and see how it looks.i would be next up great so i waited.was informed the manager would be doing my haircut.she was sweeping and cleaning up got on her phone and just kept talking.i was checking the time getting impatient.the manager knew i was waiting she saw me.another employee saw i was in a rush let her know my situation looked at the manager and the manager said she was having a crisis.and walked off.i left she lost a customer who would go there as well as my kids will never go back there again.
14 bucks for a men's haircut and i was in and out in less than 20 minutes on a friday afternoon... the heb kiddy corner from it also offers coupons for 9 dollar haircuts on the back of the receipts... nice staff as well latoya was very professional and new how to cut my hair on my first visit!
went next door for dunkin donuts. then for hair cuts. very convenient and easy to get in and out.
"usually this location does a good job. today i had one of the worst haircuts i've had in years.  it started off as a trim but she kept cutting until it left my hair a way-too-short chopped-up mess. yes, the price is reasonable, but i'm not sure i'll ever ask for n----- to cut my hair again."
"i had some good haircuts there befor, but this time the stylist  just did want she wanted . good location  but i'm  not coming back i told her don't cut the front, only thr back . i  walked out with a short front.just not happy with cindy,she is probably  a good barbor."
i have been to this great clips about 4 times.  my last two hair cut were done by alicia.  great job!  she does a wonderful job!
"got a little clean up done today by joe, dude did awesome! i usually (like every time) hate getting hair cuts and am pretty disappointed after wards, but leaving this visit i was extremely satisfied and happy with the outcome.  thanks joe!"
"the only reason i'm not leaving one star is because they have online check-in(which is pretty nifty) and he did, in fact, cut my hair. which is what i paid for(however begrudgingly). my barber did not do anything that i asked for. all i wanted was a simple harcut, fade from the bottom to the top and then longer on the top. this is not what i received. he cut one side longer than the other, none of it is even, my bangs are all messed up, and i was not given the shampooing that i asked for. i am very displeased and i will not be coming back, i will also be recommending against great clips in the future. thank you for the waste of money."
"sadly my previous stylist has left and the review has no more merit and the last few times have not gone so well... and then the most recent time i took my son for a visit clean up, half of his sideburn was cut diagonal in the wrong direction and super short, plus i had to go home and clean up the mess she left from using the thinning scissors without going over to clean up long uneven strands sticking out. i was tending to my toddler while he got his haircut and the stylist didn't even tell me. i noticed when we got tot he car... i'm not looking for amazing (which i actually got from a couple of stylist who used to work her) but not really bad can't be too much to ask. looks like i'm going to have to find a new place that can deliver some consistency"
i have never been so rudely greeted by the barbers at this location which is the one i go to so often! i went in for a neck trim-when my grandkids and i walked in one of the ladies stated all these people are here and only one hair cut!! rude and unprofessional! i will prolly start going down the road to the helotes location if this is the way we will be treated
"an inch is not 2 inches. i asked for a trim with no more than an inch removed. as the ""stylist"" began trimming she started on the back and cut  2 1/2 inches off. i just sat there stunned. at this point what can i say or do?  i know it's just hair but crap. i'm on vacation in san antonio for 7 weeks and i just needed a quick trim because i was going to the beach. i have a hair stylist in my hometown of reynoldsburg, ohio that i've been going to for 20+ years.  i'm was planning on going to her when i get home.  my advice, don't patronize this place unless you don't mind a hack job.  only reason i gave it a 2 star was because they have an online sign in."
"i usually go to this place and always have someone different cut my hair.  i prefer to be in and out. with that said, i trust all the staff to cut my hair as i like it, without any long waiting time."
"i do not give out my cell number because of privacy. i went to this location for a trim and when i politely refused to give my cell number the girl promptly said ""someone else can deal with this"" and walked away from the counter. i asked if they are refusing to cut my hair she said no but turned around and walked away. i can't believe a business would turn down my hard earned dollars over a phone number. rude, embarrassing, frustrating and a total waste of my time."
"this is your standard great clips, maybe a step above some of the ones you'll find in san antonio. the staff is all friendly and nice and i was pleased with the way the woman did my hair. the only complaint i have is the wait time. i went on two different occassions and the wait was about 20 or 30 minutes... not unbearable, but not fun. i have two great clips i could go to and this is the one i choose because it is nicer than the other option. i recommend."
"i just had a horrible experience at your bandera pointe location (1215hrs on 8/18/2014) in san antonio texas. a little history my son is less than a year old and he has already had five haircuts all at this location. all of our previous experiences has been wonderful the stylists have been patient and have done a great job at cutting my infant sons hair.today upon walking into the great clips store we didn't receive much of a welcoming greeting from the stylist that was about to cut my sons hair. as i sat down and placed my son in my lap the stylist began wetting down his hair as she started to cut i could tell that she was having a bad day or had little experience cutting children's hair by the look of frustration upon her face. after getting upset with me and my son twice because i refuse to force an infant not to move a little i got up and departed the location. after leaving the bandera pointe location my son and i proceeded to the huebner commons location here in san antonio where we where professionally greeted and i have to say dinorah who cut my sons hair did a wonderful job. i regret to say i didn't get the name of the lady at the bandera pointe store, but can describe her as an older red headed lady who's station if you were to walk in the front door is the first one on the left. i'm sorry if she was having a bad day, but her lack of professionalism will result in me advising other parents of small children to refrain from doing further business at that location."
"i have been coming to this location for years,  i will be finding somewhere else going forward.  i got a bad haircut,  i can deal with that,  going back and getting a refund to be barked at and insulted by the guy who cut my hair is unacceptable.  having the manager recognize my bad haircut,  listen to her employee be extremely rude and not even apologize?! go anywhere else,  you'll thank yourself."
"this place cut my hair so bad. i literally begged the older lady that helped me to only take off the very tips of my hair.. i started off asking for only a half inch to be cut; she told me she would have to trim a little more than that. basically she kept working me up the length she was going to cut it. she asked to cut 2 1/2 inches. i literally begged her to only trim 1 1/2. i was so obviously uncomfortable and felt like now that she had the scissors in her hands it wasn't really important what i wanted. i was right too, she ended up cutting a total of 4 inches off of my hair! literally! yeah yeah it's just hair and it grows back.. but hair is really important to girls, especially me.. anyway i shed a few tears over it lol. i had hair that touched my hips. now it barely covers my chest.. yeah.. that's fucked up. i spent years growing it out and she just chopped it into a generic medium length cut even after i begged her and showed her pics. anyway you get the point. i'm pissed."
"i was so glad when this location opened!  close to home. as most great clips i've been to, clean, cool, and friendly peeps. a few have been here since opening but then again...  i typically don't come on the same days of the week. if you haven't yet, download the app and check in online. makes life easy when you arrive and also gives you a heads up on the wait."
"haircuts can be expensive. ok now that i got captain obvious out of the way, great clips crosses a line.when they first started, haircuts were $8, then went up to $9...then $12...currently $14.now i can live with inflation...however...normally, i request a rinse after a haircut so i am not shedding clippings all day, and not itching either, and normally they give me a rinse.the last two times i went in, they refused the rinse because the manager or owner said that since it's not a regular menu service, they won't do it.  i went back after the first time thinking that was a one time thing, but nope... it's a thing. so they made me get a $4 shampoo in order to get rinsed. that effectively took the haircut up to $18, then tip took it over $23.now, for that price, i could go to the good barber or any sports clips and get a shampoo, hot towel, and neck and shoulder massage, and free neck trim between haircuts.  so basically, if i am forced to pay that amount, why bother to go to great clips at all if they offer less of a service? no brainer. i know, right!? i complained to corporate and they said they would contact the owner who, not surprisingly, never bothered to call me back.summary: for the most bang for the buck, great clips is totally not worth it. their menu reasoning is stupid. if you follow that reason, there are dozens of things that aren't in the service menu that they do anyway but shouldn't, right? until they change that a-hole policy, i won't go back. too bad for the employees, and it isn't their fault.still no word from the owner. the stylists are really cool here...the owner doesn't care one bit about you"
if you're going to stop in here first check in online.  they get very busy and the wait can be long.  second when you get there ask for christine!  she is the only one who has been able to cut my hair the same visit after visit and she's great with my girls who have very curly hair!  i can't say we've had all the other stylists but a few and it wasn't great.  so my stars are for christine!
"i recently moved to san antonio and have been missing my hair stylist in va who knew exactly how to cut and style my hair.1. have gotten my hair cut here a total of 3 times. first time the stylist did a great job. she normally does not work at this salon but, was there helping out. 2. went in for a trim a month or so later.  new person not the same person i had the first time the girl butchered my hair. i came home and washed and blew dried it out and my hair was unevenly cut. long strands here and there. it was terrible. one side longer than the other. how do you do this especially if you are supposedly professionally trained. 3. called great clips and they said i could come in and get my hair fixed for free. (they call it a redo) 4. luckily for me i got the first stylist and she fixed my hair and did a great job. i wish she was there permanently. seems like she is the only one that can cut hair. have not gone back since."
"had a truly wonderful experience with ms. victoria! i have a regular hairstylist who does my color & she is wonderful, however i can no longer afford the $55 & up for a hair trim/cut. a friend referred me to victoria at this great clips location. i admit, i had pretty low expectations but i was blown away! victoria was very sweet & quick yet precise. i have to say this was one of the best haircuts i have ever had!!"
"they do a very bad job in this place. i have three boys that get haircuts and the only person that does a good job are nancy and the gentlemen that i can not remember his name. everyone else does a very poor job. i usually do not provide reviews, however, i gave up on this place because most of the hair stylists do an awful job. to bad because the place is very close to where i live."
this place is terrible. it have constantly given them chances and they always screw up. i always come out looking worse than i could imagine. it's just this great clips. the people that work their are just terrible at cutting hair. i will never consider going to a great clips again. they are the worst.
"came to see yvette on my sister's recommendation and was not disappointed! she listened to what i wanted and understood my hairs texture and weight immediately. she suggested a few modifications to what i described, and my hair turned out great! love how the computer keeps track of how many visits to a discount, so there's no loyalty card to lose. this location is a little out of my way, but i will definitely be back!"
great experience!  checked in online and glad i did.  went on a monday night and it was super busy.  the wait online said 38 minutes but when i got there 10 peeps had their name put in.  3 stylists there so i figured it would go by fast.  i was right.  i didn't wait more than 10 minutes.  nancy was friendly and listened while i told her and showed her what i wanted.  it didn't take her more than 15 minutes to get what i wanted.  $13.  great deal.  will be back.
"the worst.. hair came out lopsided and all i asked for was a 2"" cut, nothing fancy. lupe was the hair cutter."
i came to this great clips for a spur of the moment trim and i'm so glad that i did. i too had yvonne and she was wonderful. she was super nice and friendly but didn't force awkward small talk like some stylists do. she also gave me suggestions when i asked but was not overly pushy with them. she did an incredible job and i will definitely be back to see her!
"i've been going here since the place opened. never ever had a bad cut. sometimes (extremely rare)  i'll get a cut that's not spectacular but still decent, but 9.9 out of 10 times i'll get exactly what i want and it looks amazing. even on their busiest days they take the time to ask all the right questions and check with you through the process. i've probably seen 8 or 10 different stylists there and they get it right. today i went and saw vanessa. it was busy but she took time, went above and beyond. in my opinion she stands out among the place. very good at what she does. i've gone to her twice now and both times did exactly the same thing going above and beyond what i asked for. i can totally tell she loves what she does. i won't be surprised when i find out she gets her own place. you'll be amazed no matter who cuts your hair but if you get vanessa, you'll see what i mean"
"i got out of my vehicle and checked my 14 year old son in for a hair cut an hour before closing.  i ran an errand accross the street.  i text my son i am omw and he responds that ""the lady will not cut my hair because a parent is not here"":(  i rush to great clips and get there 10 min before closing.  i ask my son if he likes his hair cut and he says no.  the lady was rushing.  now i have to pay again to fix this rush job.  another point is they have notes on the type of style of hair cut each member of my family likes so i do not know what the problem was.  not like my son needed to sit on my lap so i can make him stay still.  better yet, ask my son how he likes his hair cut.respectfully, dissatisfied customer"
"wish i could give zero stars. rude, rude, rude employees.  we checked in online, it was extremely busy when we got there.  three different employees were very rude to us: all before we even got checked in at the counter.  my husband asked me a rhetorical question, what is going on (as in why is it so busy).  several (4 or 5) were standing at the counter in spite of the volume of customers.  one sarcastically and loudly said, ""its back to school, that's what's going on"", in a tone that was very condescending.  meanwhile, another employee asked if we checked in online, i confirmed.  she asked for the name, i gave the last name.  she snapped at me and said ""names, names, i need the names of everyone getting their haircut""...there were 3 of us).  then when referring to my daughter (who is told by everyone she is model material), she referred to her as ""him"", which i believe was done on purpose.  lastly, when the ""names!"" girl was asking names and spellings i confirmed her questions with ""yep"" instead of yes... which prompted a third girl (who was picking her fingernails and manually scraping chipped polish off while standing at the counter)to loudly mock me.  are you kidding?  unprofessional all around.  we turned around and left and never, i mean never going back."
"worst haircut ever, i wish i could give this place a zero star. she was rushing with hair cut, she finished with in 10 mins. horrible customer service. i gave this place a second chance and they fucked it up once again. would never recommended to anyone. stay away from this place to save your time and money."
"don't go, unless you're in basic training. actually, still don't go. places like these will lure people in because they're fast and cheap, but let me tell you they're gonna butcher it. avoid this establishment like the plague!!!"
"disorganized system of checking in clients that literally skipped over my husband who checked in online. as we waited in the shop we saw my husbands name go up the screen to number 1 and after that other clients went ahead of him and not one stylist there bothered to call out his name. the receptionist was not where she was supposed to be to validate check in so the system for online check in is completely useless. the manager was ""on vacation"" so of course there was  no one we could lodge a complaint with. never going back to this location. i feel that if you have an online check in system for your clients that come in for service that system should be used better."
"i had a lot of anxiety before coming here. i can say all that was eased by melissa, she was so awesome and patient with me. she knows how to frame a face and i appreciate the time she took on me. i got in line online and only waited 15 mins to be seen. melissa is a total professional and i recommend her to anybody who's thinking about going. i like that they aren't pushy and don't try to up-sell."
horrible.  stylist was getting ready to take my child when someone else walked in and was helped right away because they checked in on line.  the whole process was horrible as nothing was explained to me.  i saw her getting set up for a four year old and then she tosses the booster aside and helps someone else without a word to me.  won't ever be back.  customer service goes a long way.
"i'm fairly specific as to how i want my hair cut, i had gone to great clips last month and my stylist did a fantastic job.  however, i went in this morning and the experience was ridiculous.  after signing in on-line with no wait (that's nice), i asked the stylist assigned to me (christina) to provide the following:1. a number two clipper tapered to in line just below my temple (holds hands to demonstrate position).  2.from that point, my remaining hair should be the same length -- with approximately 1/2"" to be cut.  that makes a sharp transition, not a gradual taper above the line i specified.  i can't have that or my hair will appear to spike between the taper and the top -- which i hate.3. i reiterated that i wore my hair exactly as i was wearing it when i walked in, so it should be symmetrical. i told her that like the sides of my hair to hang slightly over the taper and then demonstrated by pulling my hair on both sides and letting it drop over the sides.christina said, ""no problem"" and then started the taper.  she started off fine, the usual banter,  and confirmed the top length before cutting.  then she started blending the taper into the rest of my hair...,wait, what? halfway through the clearly uneven cut, she says -- ""do you comb it to the side?"" ""uh, no -- i wear exactly as i did when i walked in.""  however, i can't do that any more because of the chop job she did.  the taper was uneven on both sides and carried higher than i requested, i tell her as much to which she replies, ""well, i think it looks good."" i disagreed and she says: ""no, it looks real good, you should wear it like that."" i respond with, ""well, i guess i've got no choice really.""  here's some advice: your opinion of what the haircut looks like is not as important as delivering the haircut i requested.  i suppose some of these stylists are capable of a single haircut and that's what you're going to get when you walk in.she then asks, ""is there anything else you want me to do?""  from the customer perspective, that's a nonsensical question.  you didn't do what i asked you to do the first time so why would i bother providing additional instructions.  however, as a glutton for bad hair styles, i tell her we'll have to continue the taper and take more length off the top or it's going to be difficult to style.  she tells me again that it looks good.  nice.  i told her i was done and walked out at 9:39 am  with what can only be described as the worst haircut i've ever received.  but hey, christina liked it, so i guess that's all that matters.    bottom line, i've had a great stylist (i think she was a manager -- she was awesome) and one that ignored everything i said.  unfortunately in business you're only as strong as your weakest staff member.  so, one star."
"horrible experience... walked in friday morning at 10am with my morning coffee and my fiance. i sat down to wait for him in the waiting area and was told by a woman who was vigorously tapping a handwritten sign by the register no drink allowed. i asked since i was just sitting in the lobby if that was ok and all 3 of the employees now at the register stated in unison, no it's not allowed. needless to say we walked out and he went elsewhere. i understand kids, spills, cleanup, etc. but a grown woman with a lidded coffee??"
went in for the first time and got a hair cut within 5 minutes. samantha was my stylist and she was great. she talked most of the time and seemed to like her job. she was very tentative to styling my hair and to asked if i was happy with it so far and what she needed to do to it. will be going back. *update* i have been to this location for over a year now and go every 3-4 weeks. they have quite a bit of turn over but all the girls they get are good and always a good cut. enjoy!
"the online check-in is a great plus for this place. it's always very busy, so that's a good sign that they do well. they are in line with pricing. just wish they would keep the personal banter to a minimum. it can get very sexually vulgar with these ladies. keep in mind if you bring kids."
"totally messed up mine and my sons  hair! from out of town and i saw good reviews, went and was very disappointed. have a wedding to go to and have to make due with what i have. never coming here again when i'm in town. rather let it grow out."
"with all the commutable illnesses that can be contracted, the service industry needs to be on high alert regarding cleanliness. i walked into this place with hair balls in the carpeted area. the ""stylists"" work area was covered in hair and her scissors were covered in the last person's (or others before) hair. when i asked if she had other clean scissors. she stopped what she was doing (about to cut my hair with dirty scissors) and cleaned them off with barbacide (sp?) and a dirty towel. sorry but i will not be going back there again. one nic from a dirty clipper and you'll never know what you'll get."
the whole family had had a haircut here at some time.  they do a great job and the cut is $10 for kids and $12 for adults.  they are always courteous even when the place is packed.
got a cut by stephanie. she was great. did exactly what i wanted and made sure i didn't want any changes when she was done.
"this hair salon doesn't offer any way to sign up for their extensive wait of at least an hour and a half except for walk ins and downloading their corporate app. if you call, they are abrupt and push you off the phone. when you finally get a haircut they tell you most things are against policy and one of their stylists will use your shoulder to get the hair off you by hitting your collarbone over and over, leaving a bruise. also havjng gone multiple times there have been no repeat stylists, forcing me to have to repeat what i need to a person who won't cut it exactly the same way as my previous hair cut. overall crap, for children and never for business or military. their fades are absolute crap and will make it so you have to come back in and ask for a redo from another stylist."
"i considered giving this locations a one star review but lucked out from learning if it would earn such a review. i walked in today to see the place was busy; there were five stylists working and five people on the list before me. when i checked in the stylist was rude, expressing her frustration that i was a new customer with a groan and eye roll and she'd need to input my name and number. she was unable/unwilling to give an estimated wait time. once seated, i saw another customer walk toward the cashier after receiving a cut; his haircut was bad, the hair line on the back his neck was obviously crooked. this poor guy clearly had no clue what was going on the back of his head. i immediately got up and left.with all the other options in the area, the choice was easy for me to go down the street."
excellent service: johnny is as good as any salon barber.the sign in is a great feature!!
"we have been customers at their locations in san antonio for over twenty years.the past two years we have noticed that the stylists have changed every week.the quality of many of the new techs is pretty bad and we can never get our favorite stylist because they always transfer people from their normal locations.   unlike most hair salons, great clips does not believe you should rely on a certainperson to cut your hair. now, every time you visit great clips you take a chance on a potluck stylist and that will not work for us.  contacting the corporate office for great clips does not work. they have no control of the local owners who don't care. they just want to grow as large as they can and make lots of dough. the individual customer is of zero concern at great clips."
"don't bother coming here. use your money on more experienced stylists.  most of these girls seem straight out of school and don't do a good job at listening to what you want done and also overlook the cut they've done, because the past 3 times my son's hair always had hair peices that are long and they didn't cut or...his line was crooked and had to take him back twice.  they don't act too friendly and inviting especially the manager. i do not reccomend coming here. take your son's to a actual barber. the dudes tend to take their time and get it right unlike the females."
terrible customer service. online check in completely inaccurate.  checked in online and was quoted a 20 minute wait time. arrived 5 minutes prior to our appointment time and when we checked in we had a 25 minute wait from that point. stylists are extremely rude and do not care that your quoted wait time is grossly underestimated.  don't waste your time on the app or this mismanaged business. so many other options in ah where your business is appreciated.
"i had been going to this location for hair cuts, however today i was treated very rudely and did not get the type of service i expect. i went to check in online and was received a message stating that they were not accepting online check-ins. they showed a 56 minute wait on the website. so, i called and dominic answered the phone. i told him that i was trying to check in online and it would not let me, and he did not know why it would not let me perhaps for the length of wait time. i asked if he would check me in over the phone and he stated he could not do that it was only available online. he stated i would have to come to the location to check in. i let him know that did not make sense to me and he got a very condescending tone and said if i want to get in that is what i have to do or wait until. it does not make any sense to me that they would want me to drive in, check in, and wait for an hour sitting there. they created the check in service so their clients would not have to wait like this and i am confused on why it matters how you check in. so i let dominic know that i would find a new location to get my hair cut, for good."
they have an app for androids and iphones now. this app tells you how long the wait time is and let's you check in. if your taking the whole family you can check everyone in. so convenient and so web 2.0.got my cut by maria today. she took her time and did an excellent job.
"hit or miss depending on who is working that day. staff is friendly, ample parking, and it's great that they save info from your last visit, but the haircuts are not consistently good."
i always said i'd never get my haircut at a place like this due to my overwhelming fear of getting my hair butchered. the girls at great clips put my fears to rest. always super friendly and upbeat you can't go wrong here. great clips have saved me in a pinch and they'll do the same for you!!
"my 80-year-old father went for a haircut at this great clips recently.  five minutes after this great clips ran his credit card, which he handed to the gc employee to pay for his haircut (and tip), that card was also ""somehow"" billed for an $800 online purchase with a company we have never heard of.  and then another online purchase was made. our bank alerted us.to activity on my father's credit card because it was highly unusual for his card.   when we called this gc store, the great clips manager was of no help though.  thus, we will never go there again.  be careful of this particular store."
"even though this is convenient and we come here all the time - i was very dissappointed with the last trip.  i thought my husband was to blame every time my son came home with all of his gorgeous curly hair cut to bits.  so - i took him this time and gave specific instructions on his haircut.  did she listen to one word i said?  no!   it was awful - i will not go back and let them do that again to my five year old again!   poor kid, i think he's young enough that he won't be scarred for life.   hello - listen to your cusomers please!!!!   they got two stars because they give free lollipops after your haircut and it is fast.  (maybe fast because they don't listen and cut everyone's hair the same or however they heck they want to do it!!!!)"
"i have been using this great clips for over 2 years. i've met the owners. they had a stylist who has since moved on, i was sad, he was awesome. even styled my hair in a way that covered a defective hairline. but the last 2 times, treecey has been my stylist. wow the conversation, the attention to detail and helping me look my best. treecey is the best!!! and trust me, i need all the help i can get!!!for reasons i do not want to get in to, i have a reasonable special accommodation - not getting cuts at a certain station, this place is awesome in making us feel welcomed and valued and appreciated. treecey is really the best !!!"
"i get haircuts on a regular for military training. i decided to try this location because i was in the area and had a good experience there before. i am not one to write a bad review but when an employee gets a whole store to laugh at a customer its just not right. i was a bit hesitant to write this but i honestly have nothing good to say. i check in and get taken right away by tamber. she was the only one that didnt have people waiting for her so i guess that should have been a sign for me to not go with her. i get seated and she makes small talk, which was nice until i commented on the lenght of the top of my hair. i made a comment asking her to ""make it short on the top and that you can't really mess it up because if anything goes wrong i can just shave my head since i am military."" her response to me was ""don't judge me, remember i'm the one cutting your hair"". as soon as she said that everyone in the waiting area started laughing, including herself. i took it as her making fun of me and i felt embarrassed and humiliated in front of everyone. i'm not saying she's bad at cutting hair but she can improve her skills with her customers or maybe have a different approach because not every customer is open to being laughed at. i'm a very quiet and to myself person but i also feel like if i wanted to get laughed at i would be at a comedy club. tamber is not someone i would recommend going to. i hope no one has to endure what i did but i highly dont recommend tamber at all."
i don't like posting negative comments but....horrible service and several rude people working there.never going there again; other great clips out there that will do a better job and actually value my business; courtesy and customer service goes a long way and folks there need re-training in those key areas!
very rude employee told us they were closed at 7pm when online and in store said closing time was 8 pm we also were checked in online.the employee immediately told us in very rude tone that they were closed and demanded us to leave without an apology or any sympathy towards customer.
"i told the lady what i wanted, 4 on the sides tapered to a 0 (with the 0 being really low) she brought the zero basically up to the crown of my head on the sides and you can see perfect squares on the back taper. when i told her if she could blend it in better she said ""your head is shaped weird with bumps but i can try to make it not show"". i have never been to a barber in my entire life who has commented on any ""weird bumps"" on my head that has affected my haircut. i have been here before and enjoyed it, but this lady (lagenia is on the receipt) showed lack of understanding of what i told her i wanted and lack of skill to complete the job i paid her to do and then blamed it on me for her lack of skills. i have faith in the store but not in this women. i guess it's my fault for assuming if you can get hired you should be half decent at your job."
"walked in and two barbers free and no one waiting. purple hair lady checked me in asked if i checked in online, when i said no she told me to have a seat. waited 10 min, she got her check in and mademe wait. the either barber walked in the back room.  as i got up to leave he left too. crappy service. more concerned about corporate wait time.  ever going back, plenty of other shops in town"
got my haircut by daniel today and i know who'll be cutting my hair from now on! talk about skill he gave me a fantastic haircut and was very attentive to what i wanted done. he's a fantastic stylist!
i normally come to this great clips and it's always been awesome until today new staff and they guy that i was getting my haircut had some attitude he asked what i wanted and i said i'll get the same haircut like last since they always document notes for your next haircut nope he was having a really bad attitude and when i gave him a look of disgust he played it off by saying he was joking and the rest of the haircut went awful as i was just saying anything to get out of there and not get pissed off. the other employees saw as well and did nothing nor accommodated for it all they said was there's your total and expected a tip
"today i got my hair cut for the first time in over a year. i was really hesitant to go to great clips since the last time my hair was cut way shorter than i asked for. kelly was my hair stylist and she made me super comfortable. she would consult me on every cut she made. even though i live in helotes, i will drive to this great clips because i felt that as a customer i actually mattered."
"first time back to a great clips/chain haircut place since asking for a 1 on the sides and getting a buzz cut at a sportsclips. i was impressed by the check-in system which makes the waiting process slightly less tedious but really just saves you the trouble of writing your name on a piece of paper or remembering who came in before and after you - for that i give 2 stars for keeping up with the times. now for the cut. after about 30-45 min of waiting, which is very good for a sunday afternoon, i was shown to my seat by linda whom i trusted with her 40+ years of cutting hair. i had my hair styled in a classic side part, pretty straight forward and standard. just a trim is all i asked for, keeping the same style, straight tapered side burns with a hard part for emphasis/ease in future styling for myself. i knew this wasn't going to be prettying when she begins to cut my sideburns and the clipper randomly turns off and rips the hair out of the side of my head. this happened 2 more times until she switched clippers and plugged into a new socket. things afterward went fairly normal but the end product ended up with a terrible blend on the sides that puffs out and top that was equally trimmed. i now have an ice cream cone hair shape instead of my clean, slicked sides and top which took 4 months of cuts with my barber in houston to achieve. needless to say, i've lost all faith in these run of the mill salons that get people in and out. it's great for kids who don't need anything out of the ordinary but if you're a guy looking for a serious cut, take the time to find a barber who knows men's hair - it's well worth the ""trouble"". but hey, it's just hair, it'll grow back, right?"
"after leaving the bandera pointe location dissatisfied  today , my son and i proceeded to the huebner commons location here in san antonio where we where professionally greeted and i have to say dinorah who cut my sons hair did a wonderful job.  john used to cut my hair for many years until the drive got to be too far but i have to say he is one of the best. i highly recommend both of these stylist if your looking for a great haircut."
"erika (i think that was her name) gave me the best first-time haircut in my life. that is no joke. we had never met and i just walked in off the street. then i waited a long time to go back since i wanted to see if she could do it again, even if she kind of forgot me. when i went back, she sort of did not remember me, which was good for my plan. and guess what? another perfect cut. wow. here's the kicker: when she asked me how i wanted it cut, both times, i just said, ""make it look good"". and she sure did.i wish i could go to her for the rest of my life. but since i am not now in texas, here's hoping she will open her own line of salons and/or salon school. please, please, please erika, teach others to give those kinds of cuts! maybe great clips could get her to be national trainer or something. whenever i am back in town, i will be stopping by.(btw, if i have the wrong name, sorry, but i also recall her having a partial gold crown on a tooth. that would be another way to find her.)"
"i have to cut my hair once a month so i have been here a couple of times.  if you come early on a weekday there is no wait and you can get in and out in 10-15 minutes.  the staff is friendly and competent so if you need a trim in a hurry, this is the place to go."
"the pricing is not too bad, but the quality is really not there.i'm sure it's a hit or miss since they have multiple hair dressers, but i think quality control can definitely use some work."
i walked in and two stylist where sitting down they said it will be a few minutes. another customer walks in and goes straight to a chair a few minutes later another customer walks in and sits straight down. then i look back at the screen and i go from next to position 5 on the list while no one else walked in
wow this is the worst place ever! i walked in to get my veterans card and this so called manager lakent gave me the worst attitude about getting my card.  he said i had to get a service today and all this song and dance and told me to adjust my attitude. someone made this guy the manager. yea if you want attitude served on a platter this is the place and so much for the respect of other veterans.
"so it's haircut time an i decided to try out this location instead of my usual hair stylist but oh my yelper's i think i made a mistake but it's ok i'm on yelp helping my brother an sister yelper's don't come here unless you a different hair stylist then who i had her name was sarah an wow she definitely needs to look into a new line of work first of all talk to your customers i mean talk about awkward silence we could of talked about the weather or my day or even yours we could of talked about your two time hair two tone hair of blonde an black i would have been happy to talk about your upper center lip piercing anything but silence not good in my opinion but if you like that type of stylish omg you'll love her not me then 2nd thing (shaking my head) in dis belief of the mistake you made following not talking to me, yelper's can you believe it my fade was uneven when i told her she even tried to fix it but was unsuccessful made it even more uneven i was completely flabbergasted by this that after attempting to fix her own mistake i gave up an said forget it what's done is done so finally when i thought it can get worse it does wow i said finger length top no not sarah she does what she wants an then her come the clippers not sure where she was gonna cut with the clippers by the time she did the top of my head it was to late why sarah well if she thought it was gonna look good she was wrong not only did she leave my hair uneven it now it's also extremely short no need to style well i will say a few good things about this place so i don't seem like i'm bashing it too harsh when i walked in i was immediately greeted felt very welcome to arrive thank you an the restroom is excellent clean  good luck yelper's if you choose to cut your hair here if i knew this was gonna happen i would have gone to a kindergarten school to cut my hair by kindergarteners i'm sure it would of came out better then this"
"these people really don't care about their job. they don't care about the customer. when i went, i had to sign up using the online wait list. the waitlist told me that i had a specific time to show up. i showed up 10 minutes before that time, but i was never registered in their system or i was skipped. the clerk told me that i needed to register online again or register in person and wait for another hour. this has happened twice now and i felt that i was just another number in their system. definitely do not want to return here ever again. they don't care about keeping their customers and so i will not come here again."
horrible experience here came in for a trim and came out with a high and tight.... i will not be getting a hair cut at great clips here again
"went in for a quick trim and left totally butchered. throughout the cut my stylist was distracted and left my seat about 15 times to handle the front desk and reprimand employees in front of everyone. should have gone with my gut and got out of there asap, but i had to take my glasses off for the cut and i couldn't see what was happening.  terrible move. i asked for a trim and to blend it a little longer up top, and came away looking like a damn adolf toadstool from mario brothers and had to pay $15 bucks to walk out in my hat. terrible. if you have hair and want anything other than a buzz, do not go here."
"the wait here is horrendous and even if you check in online they don't see you on time, so what's the point. the only they are busy is because there no other salons or places to get your haircut nearby. i only use this place when i have to and i usually regret it. funny thing is i never have these issues at other great clips locations."
i've never had to wait too long at all here when i check in online. i've always gotten good haircuts and never had any complaints. i had rose and she did a wonderful job and was very friendly the whole time.
don't get a haircut from jennifer she cuts your hair really rough & she seems a little bitchy i just can't believe how bad she cut my hair and my hair was a simple men's haircut and she was complaining how long its taking to cut my hair. um i'm a guy!!! my hair is not that long!!! it's only been 2 weeks since i got my hair cut from another stylist at this location..so i don't understand why your complaining.. you need to find a different job!! and i'll stick to the other stylist thanks!!
hasn't given me any issues and they know how to cut my hair because of the frequent customer app they run. only reason it is not 5 stars is their conversation to each other was unprofessional and they didn't tell me about the free rinse after until i asked about it.  i mean every guy hates that itchy feeling around the neck after a haircut.
"i recently moved from out of town and am very loyal my hairstylist but it was time for me to find a new place.   this particular location is close to my home and the first time a man there cut it all wrong however i went back and they fixed it up.  now i went again and the girl that i got this time cut my ear and didnt tell me. i felt a knick but that was that, i was disappointed slightly with the cut but when i got home i saw my ear was bleeding. i became furious and went back in.  they just cant seem to get it right.  a lady with salt and pepper hair is always the one who takes my complaint.she seems to be the only one that knows what she is doing , everyone else not so much"
"this is about one particular hairstylist name nancy. usually i don't have a problem with great clips, but this time, it was awful. she was brushing through my hair and claimed that she sees head lice. um, what? she then brush flake off to show me... it was dandruff. but she kept insisting it was lice. so i left and went to my doctor's office. it was dandruff. how can someone be so stupid to accuse a customer of having head lice when you can't tell the difference between dandruff and lice? never coming back there again."
"unfortunately i forgot the woman's name who cut my hair, but she was very nice to me and gave me a great cut. i was very surprised. i have gone to a few different great clips and it's usually a terrible cut, but she was great. i just moved to san antonio and it was a nice to talk to a friendly person."
"might as well have done it myself...earlier today i took my son for a haircut. after waiting for over half an hour as others ""previously signed in"" took their seats, my son finally was served.my son is a special needs person, and is very uncomfortable with confrontations or advocating actively for himself. at the end of the alleged ""haircut"" session, he was left with a ""wicked comb-over"" for the front of his scalp, and a poorly shaped occiput and collar line. to add insult to injury, the employee (whom i refuse to call a ""stylist"") accepted a gratuity exceeding 50% of the bill, without missing a beat.i strongly encourage prospective customers to look elsewhere, or just cut your own hair. you'll be better satisfied, and you'll save some money."
"like i said in my last post, i went back and i am happy and satisfied even more. kim did amazing job and now i know for sure i will be back."
i understan this places they do a lot of employee rotation. but personally i got a very good service from diana.
"thanks,  heidi..... for giving my son a great haircut for the last few days of school. the cut looks awesome for our vaca.   it was a quick, painless, visit as always!!  there were about 10 people waiting to get haircuts and everyone got taken care of quickly.   that is what we hope for when it is beautiful outside."
"the service was lackluster, but i wouldn't expect much better from a quickie haircut place. they could have been a bit friendlier. i didn't get my haircut, but my friend did and the end result was good. nobody was there at noon on a saturday, so if you're in a hurry, i'd recommend it, just don't expect the friendliest of people."
steven is the worst stylist in this establishment. he smells and coughs everywhere. he has cut my hair the last 2 times i've been in and totally screwed up. today he cut one side of my bangs but not the other. don't worry i fixed it myself.
"cindy is the best!!! def give her a try! they take appointments and walk ins at this place too. not to mention it was pretty cheap too. i am very picky on who i let do my hair but i needed a trim really bad so i gave this place a try. i can say that i have found a home for my hair. they do men's and women's and cindy is very nice, funny, and talented. you won't be sorry!"
"horrible i just got my haircut there today and it looks horrible worst haircut i've ever gotten. you definitely get what you pay for,  the staff is very unprofessional and you can tell that some of them don't know what they are doing. now i have to go somewhere else and pay more to get it fixed should've just paid extra to go somewhere better in the first place"
i like getting my hair cut but online check in system is bull crap. when i walk in 2 onlines ahead of me. only my son and i are here i got hair cut my son had to wait for these 2 guys because they showed up. they keep the online check ins for an hour. total crap i always try not to go here anymore because of this
"i don't even know where to start, our experience was bad all around.  i went in with my husband and two sons and all three of them got a bad haircut.  the worst was my six and half year old.  jackie, the woman cutting his hair, actually hurt him cutting his hair and made him cry.  i thought at first he was just being whiney but then i saw that he was actually bleeding!!!  seriously??  he was being still there was no reason for him to be bleeding.  amanda b cut my husband's and two year old's hair did an ok job but she was incredibly unfriendly.  actually there didn't seem to be a friendly person in the place.  as soon as we walked out i promised my older son that we would never go back there.  do yourself a favor and go across the street to sports clips."
"i would take away stars if i could.  worst experience for me and my family.  two days ago i took my 5 yr old daughter & 4 yr old son there because i thought it would be more affordable than the kid places and just as good - i was so wrong!my daughter has loose curls and i have straight hair so i don't always know who things are going to turn out with her hair.  i explained to the woman cutting that my daughter wanted short hair - like at the end of rapunzel - and showed her what i meant.  i also let her know that i was worried since i knew the curls would spring up and didn't know what it would turn out like.  i asked her if i should keep it longer or if the cut works on short hair?  she couldn't give me any idea what so ever.  she said, ""so you want it to hit her neck?""  i said, ""no, not if it won't look right.  what will curly hair  look like?""  she just looked at my daughter's hair and didn't say anything but sort of shrug her shoulders.  since the woman had long hair with some curl in it, i told her to just trim and keep it long with layers.  usually they can do someone else's hair like their own. the layers are horrible!  it's like she tried to give it a feathery look that just doesn't work with curls.  instead of the beautiful individual curls we started with, she now has one continuous wave at the back of her head.my son's hair didn't turn out any better from the other woman who cut his hair.  my husband stood by and explained to keep it a little long on top.  she took the order and spent the rest of the time talking to another associate.  she cut it short like a military cut (which i did not want).  and my poor son has crooked cuts all over his head!i gave it two days to see if their hair would settle to something nicer, since fresh cuts sometimes (but rarely) be deceiving, but i can still see the jagged cuts in my son's hair and my daughter's hair is even less cooperative even though i'm using products that usually tame it.  the only reason i haven't gone in to complain is because i would have to bring the kids to show what's wrong and i don't want the kids to hear me say something negative about their cuts.sorry i don't have staff names, but it was not the cindy mentioned in the other review."
thanks shannon! love my hair ! u did an excellent job! hadnt had my hair cut in a long time and u nailed it!!!much thanks!!!lucy
"went here for my son's haircut on a referral from family in the area. wait was 45+ minutes when we signed in but that was my fault for waiting to come in until the evening. the place is clean, including the restroom. decent amount of products in stock. ""imma"" cut my son's hair and did a pretty good job. she made sure to put his haircut description into their system so the next time we go in, the stylist will already know what he prefers. likes: i liked that as you sign in a monitor faces the customers so you can see how many people are ahead of you. i liked that as people came in they are greeted. i liked that customers are apparently able to sign in online/on an app. dislikes: none as of yet."
"i will not come back to this location.  stylist inmaculada was incredibly rude and abrasive, undermining my parenting, telling them to sit in the barber chairs next to me when i told them to stay in the waiting area at the front of the store, offered them candy after i told them they could not have candy, and then when i asked her to stop and let my do my job as a parent, she tried to argue with me."
"awesome, awesome experience this morning! i figured it would be a bit of a wait, considering it's a saturday morning and the change of seasons. there was a stylist at every chair, and a customer in every chair- but they are so efficient that i didn't wait more than 5 minutes. once in the chair, i felt very comfortable, my stylist asked me what i wanted and told me exactly how she was going to do that for me. i cut off about four inches from the back and evened it all out for a really cute bob. i am very very happy with my result, and i will be back. :-)"
"it might not look like much on the outside, but it's pretty awesome. the inside is nice and the people are even nicer. i went to sarah and she was really nice and did a great job. i will definitely be returning here to see her again."
i enjoy going to this location. they have been cutting me and my kids hair for about 4 years now. there is a lot of business going through the doors and i don't mind the wait for a good haircut. they staff it appropriately for the traffic.
"i love this laid back place. i'm not high maintenance so it's perfect. they don't make fun of my box dye job; just give me the exact cut i want and i'm always pleased. very nice and friendly stylists, too."
staff is always friendly and they always know how you ordered your last haircut
"i had been going there for a while and had the hair cut i liked in the system,so i went in and they cut my almost bald when i had a medium style haircut in the book"
myself and my boys never go anywhere else.  the girls are always friendly and consistent.  love em!
"my family and i have been coming to this place for the past 7 years. they are extremely consistent and always have a great attitude. they always welcome you with a resounding, ""welcome to greatclips!!"". we plan on using their services for many years to come."
"you like to gamble? are you into fits of anxiety? this place is like putting your quarter into the gumball machine and hoping for the red piece... sometimes you get it... some times you get the yellow one. isn't it obvious? every time you come here, there's different stylists working? forest gump could have written this review... ""you never know what you're gonna get...""  i only go here when i'm feeling suicidal... anyone up for a little ""haircut roulette?"""
"no wait great service very fast and efficient, did my brothers hair cut just how he wanted"
"the place started to go downhill. rude manager,  no longer offering discounts to veterans at this location and my last two haircuts ended with cuts in my head. alon location nearby is way better"
wow i cant believe the damage this place did to my pet boyfriend. he dropped in at about 10 am-11am for a haircut to get ready for new years celebrations and he walked out beat up and looking like he has some kind of rash or allergic reaction. the lady that cut his hair used dull clippers. it felt like he was being shaved with a disposable razor. it even broke skin in some places. please see pictures and avoid! 1 star for not messing up the actual haircut.
i had a great experience here at this great clips. the two ladies were really nice and the blonde lady did a good job on what i wanted. she looked at the picture twice to make sure and it came out beautifully. unlike the last time i went somewhere else i showed the same picture and she didn't do what i wanted.
"came here with my boyfriend to get his hair cut. he wanted a basic clean up and fade. nothing too drastic or difficult. the stylist on the (i cannot remember her name but she is above average height) was rude from the get go. when she finished his hair he had long pieces sticking up on the top on both sides, uneven shave on the bottom and an almost bald spot in the back. we went back the next day to ask if she could could fix it (maybe she didn't see it because of the lighting or something) and she said no that's just how his hair is because of a ""cowlick"" and ignored the other two problems. that's a common excuse from stylists who haven't had enough training or just haven't perfected how to do a fade. i asked as politely as i could, which is hard because situations like these are already super awkward, if someone else could try to fix it and she was obviously so offended. i can't pay for a service when i know that he doesn't have a cowlick and he's had his hair cut the same style perfectly at several other places. a polite gentleman fixed it for us while the other stylist made faces, shook her head, and made remarks under her breath. i thanked both of them again before we left but she wouldn't look up from her other client and acknowledge me... we tipped both of them. i also want to add that we have run into her outside of the salon and she made the ugliest faces and once again made remarks under her breath like we are in highschool. really? we tried to be as polite as possible. it's not my fault you didn't know how to do it and you should learn how to handle critism if you're going to do a job like that. it felt like she's expecting judgement and rudeness from everyone so she beats you to it and treats you poorly. i don't recommend this location only because of her. everyone else there is polite and professional."
"we'll never go back!!!  i ask for something to be done different, next thing i know my 4 year old says ouch.  she was being too rough if you don't like your job quit, don't take it out on my kid wow!!!"
"place is just ok, they don't actually work as per customer satisfaction, but anyways it was not really bad."
"we used to come for a decent haircut at a decent price. we now come here more for the convenience of the location. the stylist today kept asking for assistance from the other employees. it felt almost as if i was getting a hair cut at a beauty college rather than at a place of business with licensed stylists. i wasn't happy with the outcome, but i didn't want this person to cut any more cause i was worried that it'd come out worse. this isn't the first time. also, a number of the stylist smelled like cigarettes. not a good smell when your hand is in my face cutting my hair. sorry to say, i feel that the quality of work done at this location has really gone done."
"worst haircut of my life. ""stylist"" was harsh, music was loud and inappropriate for family setting. no receipt given. felt unwelcome, will never go back"
"very few good stylists at this location. i have been going for years and cannot recommend any by name except for xtina so don't have high hopes for quality work here. good haircut happens about 1/5 visits and i have left before because of stylists that i know don't communicate well and with less than a professional attitude. lottery every time but the damn location is so confident...an checking in ""online"" or with the app is not much better....you still sit in like with the others that check in and sometimes even walk ins depending on your time."
"i think the experience at any salon depends on the hair stylist. if you found someone that did a good job, keep using that person. just few tips:1) come here around 8 pm on week day, there is usually no line. i think out of the 10 times i'm here, the longest wait was 10 mins. 8/10 times, i check in and i go straight to the chair. 2) weekends or long weekends, this place is packed."
"went to get my hair curled and had a picture to show the stylist what i wanted. absolutely horrible job, put too much product in and made my hair greasy and she comb the curls out which made it frizz. i had to leave and was very disappointed in the job, i shouldn't have paid. i was on a time limit, which the stylist knew. i left to go wash my hair and style it myself, which came out better than the job i received. never going back again. i'll stick to the blow dry bars, better pricing and they do a way better job!"
"they do a good job here, i am pretty simple with my hair, just a shampoo and cut at the ends. i enjoy the shampoo, they do a little massage to your scalp that feels nice. sometimes they try to push their products for sale, which i don't like."
"i don't like hair cutters who nick the skin around the scalp when my kids get a haircut. probably will not be returning for a long, long, long time."
"i agree with most of the other reviewers, this place is a lottery. $13 for adult cut, not too bad a price, and they run specials every once in awhile. i've been to this location twice: the first time there was a young girl that went by the name sami (maybe samy) and she was amazing. i wanted a drastic change to my long curly hair, and she worked meticulously on it; gave me layers and cut it shorter than i've ever had it. i absolutely loved it. i came back about 4.5 months later to get it trimmed, and i was told she no longer works there, so i just let another stylist cut it. she did fine, but she was against cutting as short as sami did. so i know i'll have to go back soon to maintain the length. i really wish i could find out if this hairstylist still works in san antonio!!!in conclusion, if you just want a quick, simple hair cut, this is the place to go.also, both times i went on a week day, once at 12, and the other at 1, and there wasn't a line."
"i got to say impressed with work and customer service from jelenna, she cut my daughters hair and did an amazing job!!!"
"so, many great businesses i've left reviews for have thanked me or offered to fix their error.  not one attempt from this franchise. i'm 3 weeks since my bad cut and hair is growing towards my ears and i'm starting to think about getting another cut..... but my bangs are still to short and pissing me off, so i'll wait a bit longer to get my next cut."
"i've gone there now 4-5 times, close to home, different stylist every time, and results are the same love it"
"i went here for years with my son and stopped going because i started to get a subpar haircut/experience. i'll admit, jennifer is awesome, but always busy, because she does a great job in which others always request her. but last week i needed to get a haircut on a saturday and decided to give them another shot since it was the weekend and i was desperate.  once again another subpar haircut and  subpar experience. i hate feeling like cattle and being rushed out in world record time. i'll be going elsewhere instead."
great service and availability of highly qualified hair cutting stylists.i appreciate the attitude and quality.online booking app/web is a great option
i usually go to get my hair trimmed and never had any issues so i took my husband to get his hair cut since we were both running errands and we can get what we need done together. he was hesitant he wasn't confident that the stylist would know how to cut i said i've never had an issue and there was lots of men getting their hair cut today. i was helped first and finished first. then waiting for him i saw his face and his horrible haircut. i was in shock how the hair stylist thought this was a good job to still want to charge him and we were so embarrassed to even dispute it while everyone was in close range. so i felt so horrible i paid... i even tipped again i was too embarrassed to go off on this stylist. i would never come back or have him come back. we had to go to another place where an experienced barber can fix his hair he only charges 14. if you want a jagged choppy haircut this is the place for you.
"if you go here, do not let karina cut your hair. she sucks!!! my husband & kids come here a lot & most of the time, the cut comes out okay because we give them simple instruction: 0.5 around & 4 at the top. i don't know how you can mess that up, but karina did! my son is taking his graduation pic this week looking almost bald. we'll still go back here, but we'll never have karina cut my boys' hair again!"
great place to get a hair cut. jennifer does great work and listens to the styles you'd like. this is the one out in eastlake.
i came to great clips and they have amazing service i was really happy with my hair cut it was so beautiful. great clips made my day!!
"great place for haircut for me easy to use the app and get a quick appointmentalways fast and easy for mei see some of the women had reviews and issue with their hair, so not sure about that.i would recommend for men as it is in the shopping area and i can go to target and lowes will i amin the shopping area."
"very uneven hair cut for myself and my wife. will not be going back again, i wasn't happy the first time either. cheap hair cut but you get what you pay for."
last minute find before heading back to guam. was welcomed by sally. wonderful personality and made the hair cut entertaining. thanks. hair cut on point.
"if you're looking for a haircut without an appointment,... seek another place. this establishment only focuses on online appointments. wanted to try this place since it has a lot of good reviews but,... completely had a horrible experience. waited for more than an hour to get a haircut!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wtf! to make matter worst,.. they kept a screen with names who's next but does not follow it. was second and yet was passed (girl picked the 5th person without online appointment) fuck this place."
"i take my 7 year old son here for his haircuts, definitely recommend jennifer! she's super nice, always double checks with me before and during the cut. his hair looks perfect every time."
"been going to this place for about 3 years. sally has been cutting my hair majority of the time when i came in. i get along with her, she's nice, and caring."
"this place has such a great vibe. the women who cut the hair are extremely nice, except for one, but other than that, great service! i recommend sally! she's probably the best out of them all, so ask for her!"
katrina did an amazing job on my sons first haircut. she was patient yet quick. my 1 year old was not scared at all! thanks for the great cut!!!
"definitely a decent place to get a haircut if you are in the eastlake area.  i have come several times and have had good experiences so far.  the prices are reasonable, the stylists are helpful and the place is clean.  i highly recommend checking in online during peak hours otherwise you will be waiting for awhile."
"the worst haircut in 12 yrs. i asked the stylist to take 1 1/2"" off my girls long hair w/a tiny bit of layers. clean up what she has. she showed me her definition of 1 1/2"". i agreed. during the cut, 3 stylists went to my daughter & measured her hair where cuts were made. one or two made addt'l cuts. in between, the original stylist made more cuts. after the final ""helper"" left, i asked her to tell me honestly how much had been cut, while more is being cut from my daughters hair. she said, ""1 1/2 inches."" i said my anxiety was due to the 3 ""helpers"". she says, ""oh we just checked her cuts. don't worry. it's a great cut."" i will not be back. (trying to post a pic.)"
"i've always had good experiences here. employee turnover means you can have a regular hair stylist but within 6 months they are gone. but everyone here is good...they keep notes in the computer of your hair styling needs. clipper length, style on top, etc... parking in this lot can be kind of crazy especially at busy periods."
"i've been going to great clips for quite awhile. i started off at the balboa store, and have been getting my cut from frankie. my wife and mother also see frankie. all three of us are extremely happy with the effort that she always gives. frankie pays attention to detail and remembers how all three of us like our cuts. she always gives suggestions, and we've never once had a complaint since frankie became our stylist. so, if you are looking for not only a great haircut, but a stylist that will make your time in her chair, fun, then go to the pacific beach location. if you have a cell phone (seriously, who doesn't?) get the great clips app, and check in online, and have a much shorter wait."
"i am also part of frankie's ""fans"". frankie relocated here to this location. this great clips location does not offer the discount card for multiple haircuts. that is why i am giving a 4 for the salon but believe me a 5 for frankie."
first time coming here.  i brought my five year old son.  i love the location as it's close to home and conveniently located near a frozen yogurt place for a nice treat afterwards.michelle was his hair stylist and was so good with him.  right before us she cut the hair of an 18 month old baby.i showed a pinterest picture of the hairstyle i was going for and she did amazing.  i have had already a few moms ask where did he get his hair cut.so i'm here to say michelle is awesome with kids and an expert stylist.cost: $15tip: $5cheaper than little locks in la jolla.they could make it a bit more kid friendly.  we appreciated the lego blocks and lollipop  very much!!
i hate to complain about a $17 haircut but as soon as we got to the car and i saw the uneven lines and long patches everywhere i went straight to cvs to purchase clippers. i couldn't let him go to school in the morning like this. i wish i had taken more pics but it was pretty bad
told me i had to check in online. this place is only good if you don't mind average. they had an attitude and it seemed i was a bother as opposed to being a customer.
i came in today and there were two people getting a haircut. one person was in front of me and i was told a 10-15 min wait. 50 mins later one of the 2 hair stylists leaves and there is still one person in front of me. waisted my hour off for lunch to end up not getting a haircut. never coming back.
"deebeh is the best!  this great clips has deebeh! the other stylists are probably good, and they cut hair fast with a great value.  i have been going to this great clips for almost four years because i had a not-so-stellar haircut (by someone who has now left this location) and deebeh fixed it no questions asked, with a polite apology and a smile!since then, deebeh has cut my hair approximately 50 times, and each time she is pleasent, friendly, professional, and does a fantastic job.  she is great!so, while i keep going to this great clips because they are cheap, and get the job done, i definitely recommend deebeh because she is awesome, and does great work!"
shout out to veronica for giving me the best haircut of my life. i'm hard to please when it comes to getting my haircut but veronica nailed it the first time she ever cut it. i explained how i was unhappy with past haircuts and she asked me a bunch of questions and found out what i was looking for. she is a true professional and i'll definitely be coming back
"been coming here for 4+ years. never really have to wait, all the employees are friendly but don't talk your ear off. shelly is great!"
"irma is the best hairdresser on the planet. no question. she is incredibly professional, detailed oriented and one of the nicest people to deal with. i refuse to let anyone else cut my hair!"
"irma did an amazing job. i'm new to la jolla and was in search for a new stylist after 10 years. she's competent, caring, and detailed oriented. highly recommend irma!"
i have been going here for a year now. checked in online which said to arrive by 5pm i arrived 15 miutes before and was rudely told they are closed. i asked abiut my online checkin and she rudely stated again that they had a busy day and she was not cutting anymore hair today. she was right she will not be cutting my hair. i feel sorry for victoria who actually does a great job. that is the reason for the 2 stars. victoria 5 stars.
"they messed up my cowlick. worst haircut i've gotten in years, and i've been getting it cut the same way for ~5 years. won't be coming back"
unfortunately this location made their own policy for veterans day and chose not to honor the promotion as great clips is know for.  i reported them to great clips hq and they said the franchise owner is in the wrong!  chose another location for veterans!
"i took my daughter in for a bang trim, she was so obedient and sweet - did everything the woman said. i stayed on the sidelines and didn't interfere and was very unaware of the horrible haircut that was being done. her bangs were crooked and choppy and she absolutely hacked the sides of her hair leaving her with a ""mullet"" style haircut: super short bangs in the front, choppy hair at her ears and long straggly hair in the back. when she presented my daughter to me and said they were done i couldn't help but laughing out loud. instead of apologizing and offering to fix the things i was pointing out to her she justified her work!! absolutely unprofessional. she then charged me for my visit. i took her to the great clips in the utc and the women there fixed her hair cut for me. they were polite and apologetic and ""did their best"" to fix the hack job done in pacific beach. we will never go back to irma at the pb great clips."
"do not work for this franchisee. im currently going through the necessary legal hoops to ensure that they are exposed for unprofessionalism at levels that have exceeded civil and legal standards that i promise will not benefit u. i was treated (in my opinion) discrimination do to my living situation ,gender and sexual orientation. i was held accountable by policies that were never given to me. training that is only given if u ask other employees that can access all your pr info do to shared passwords. pay is allocated by clocking in and out but if your time clock is not to the owners liking she will gladly alter or change it. this will not be shared with you. if you dont keep record of your time you may find your hours are not accurate. this is my personal experiences that i hope will help yours not be as unfortunate. proceed with caution. supercuts is much better and will allow u to grow ur skills."
"terrible, terrible customer service!  used the online check in for my son (19 months).   we did some errands because the wait was 63 minutes.  i still waited an additional 30 minutes beyond this.  as it was about his turn,  we had to do a diaper change.   i told them i would be back in 2 min, which i was.   they proceeded to let someone else go in front of us.  i've been going there for almost a year but this will absolutely be our last time.   the hairdresser was super rude and inconsiderate towards me and my child."
"my experience at great clips was, as the name suggests, great. i checked in online, arrived at the shop and was seated immediately, the haircut was fast but with great attention to detail and my instructions (i brought pictures to show what i was looking for) and i left with my hair cut just the way i wanted it. and all this friendly and great service at a very affordable price (even for a student) !(the only downside was that i could not blow dry my hair over a round brush, which would have been charged extra.)"
i've been coming here for awhile now and never have to wait very long in order to get my haircut without an appointment. yesterday i went and had sam cut my hair for the first time. he was really nice and explained hair products to me and had a friendly discussion as well. he also took extra steps for a smoother blend and reccomended the best ways to get discounts on the product they offer.  i will be back soon!
first time i came here a year ago they butchered me. i am reasonable and i know things happen and at the time i just let it go. so a year has passed and i figured i would give it a second chance.  this time i left with a bloody nick behind me ear and a botched fade. when the girl cutting my hair started to cry about what she did she mentioned how hard things are for her and that they only pay her $9 an hour. i felt bad for her and left after tipping her $5 to cut me.  at $9 an hour i guess they dont care about having qualified styists. live and learn i guess. probably better and safer to find another place to go for a haircut..
"i have come here every week for the past year and and i have never been disappointed.  if you need a good fade and netflix recommendations, ask for sabrina."
"i've been going to great clips about the last six months. as we are traveling the country in our rv it's nice that they can keep records of your visit with notes on how you like you hair to be cut. well, at least that's the way it's supposed to work......the fellow that was trying to check customers in shouldn't be doing this job. he's nice enough but his english language skills aren't the greatest. nor ar his typing skills. he never did get my info straight. one of the stylists tried but even she was unsuccessful. i'm not sure why. i've checked in from northern washington to portland, oregon to yuma city, california and never had an issue. strange. but, back to my hair stylist. i'd read a review where a mother complained about this gal being rough when she cut her daughter's hair. rough is an understatement! i've never had my hair jerked like that before. now for me it didn't hurt bad, but i can well imagine what that felt like to a five year old. i know it was the same gal although i don't recall her name. it was something like vima maybe. she sounded eastern european to me, not that that matters. but she needs to have a few lessons and tug a little easier on folks hair. i'm glad we're traveling. next time we're in the area i'll go to another great clips. just not this location."
"i recently visited this salon,  my experience was excellent. thank you girls for the great service and haircut for all my boys."
worse place ever! she messed up my hair bad. waste of 20 dollars seriously. i was ready to cut most of my long hair off but she didnt listen! she did what she wanted with my hair. after i got home i looked at my hair and it looks like a 5 year old grabbed scissors and just chopped my hair. i think her name was sabrina. dont let sabrina get close to your hair!
"i went in last week and had the worst salon experience i have ever had. deziree yanked and pulled on my head while dry brushing my curly hair, and by the end of the first ten minutes i was almost in tears. i should have left at that point but i really wanted to have not wasted the ten minutes she just spent torturing me. she soaked the top half of my shirt during the wash, and never asked a single question about what i wanted. i finally offered that i'd like to take dead ends off and that i'd like layers. she added no layers in my hair, but she kept asking me ""doesn't that feel better?"" not once did she ask if i liked it. i basically have a blunt cut and with curly hair that means i have triangle head. i left the salon a frizzy mess because she didn't use a single styling product, and she thought that scrubbing my head dry with a terrycloth towel was a good idea. my scalp was so sensitive from her tugging on my hair i couldn't put it up for three days. she made me feel horrible about my hair, that it was a burden that had to be dealt with. i left feeling humiliated and degraded, and once in the car i had a complete breakdown. as someone who struggles with anxiety and depression i have a hard time going to do things like getting my hair cut. i just wanted to go in and get a fresh cut, maybe a new style, just to get a little morale boost. instead i got deziree. i tried to email corporate about the incident before coming here and they sent me and email that basically said ""sorry, it's a franchise! but we'll pass on your comments to the owner and they'll call you soon."" that was last week. no one ever called. the carelessness goes all the way to the top, apparently. i've never had an issue with gc before this, but i will literally never step foot into another gc again."
adorable haircut by a great stylist who really listens. thank you for my daughters new summer time look!
"i brought my daughter into this location as a walk-in, and they tended to her immediately. she had a delightful experience, and wanted to come back into today. sabrina was amazing, and very customer service oriented, while personable with my 5year old daughter. i will be bringing her back to this location here soon. thank you, sabrina!"
"such nice people who do nice work. the stylists are speedy, nice, easy going. i've been getting my hair cut here for years and my 5 year old son has a nice time too."
this is my second time coming to this location and i loved it both times! the shampoo used for my hair smells amazing and i was shown deals on other hair products. this is probably where i'm coming to get my hair cut from now on.
"deziree was absolutely horrid. my niece left in tears because the lady was very rough, abusive and mean. basically threatened her that she would have to shave her head because her hair is ""so damaged"". do not let her touch your head or your child's head. she never once asked if we wanted to pay more to have her wash the hair to make it easier. just belittled and berated and complained that the hair was so bad. and didn't even attempt to do the hair cut she was asked to do. absolutely horrible."
terrible. i would give them 0 stars but forced to give them 1. can't post this review unless i make it longer. it this long enough?
"my husband's hair is so hard to cut correctly! deziree not only did a fantastic job, she was very fast. you can get a ""frequent flyer"" card for a free haircut. you can also check in on your phone so you don't have to wait. very friendly and professional people work here and it's very clean."
"so... this is long overdue and i am officially  boycotting this shop now. i shouldve just stuck to my go to but this haircut was pretty last minute so i chose this train wreck of a business. the 1st time i went there in quite a bit of time i was met by a girl who was very nice. i have to admit. but...she cut my hair and literally bragged the entire time she was cutting it about how good she was. now..... being confident it one thing. be completely cocky is another. she may have felt she did an ""amazing"" job but i had to come home and touch it up myself. not only that getting a haircut is a pretty personal and an up close event. not cool to be cutting someones hair and wreaking of cigarettes the whole time. so that was my 1st visit in awhile. today was my second visit in quite awhile and will be my last. deziree cut my hair. for the most part she did ok. i had to again, come home and touch it up as there were chunks of hair uncut and much longer than the area surrounding it. a previous yelper put she was quite rough. yeah, for some reason the clippers kept catching my damn skull and driving the guard into my head. not a comfortable feeling. you would think after the 2nd time you would switch up what youre doing. oh no. happened like 8-9 more times. there are many places in santee to get a haircut, this is not one of them. i choose not to indulge who i go to normally and shouldve just gone to because this is not review to promote them. this is a review to tell you all... great clips sucks and will not get my business anymore. sorry..  but today was the last straw."
"horrible experience!  the stylist, vian, trimmed my daughter's hair and was extremely rough and just pulled and pulled on my daughter's hair like she was some kind of animal.  we will never be back!  no wonder it was so empty in there (i guess that should have been my first clue)."
"the ladies here are super nice and the candy cup at the register is always well stocked. i love that you can check the wait times online and check in online so you can be seen first when you arrive. the days and times your favorite stylist are in always change so if you can, call ahead to check if they're in but you're in good hands no matter who you go to."
terrible! i took my son in to get a haircut because i had a coupon and i figured his cut is so easy you can't mess it up. well i was wrong... these ladies seriously have no idea what they are doing. i asked for a 1 faded up and blended and just to trim up the top. there is no fade and she did not blend it at all. it seriously looks like she put a bowl on his head and cut around it. i should have just went where i usually take him because now i have to take him and get it fixed anyways..
"typically have a great experience at this location, but not this time. stylist in chair to the right in front (opposite receptionist booth) was beyond rude. my teenage daughter gave very clear directions as to how she wanted her hair cut. stylist said to her, ""i'm not going that short, i'm leaving it at x length."" she might have made three snips with the scissors and declared her done. we were in and out in under ten minutes.  i paid 20 dollars for my daughter to walk out looking exactly as she did when we walked in. due to the attitude, i said nothing, paid for the careless service, and decided the best i could do is to warn others. we won't be using this particular location in the future based solely off this one stylist poor attitude and lack of service. it's a shame because up until now, i've always left pleased. save yourself the drive and cut the hair yourself. you certainly couldn't do worse. update: i knew better, but i had really hoped that last time was just a fluke. it wasn't. i took my son in for a very simple haircut including pics of exactly what he wanted. he is 12 and more than old enough to explain what he wants. he showed her the pictures, explained to her how much he wanted cut, and she called me back four times because ""she wasn't clear"". i showed her the pictures again. explained this was exactly what he wanted. pictures covered all sides of the cut. it was a simple, short on the sides and a bit longer on the top. we aren't talking about some radical cut. in the end, it was close to what he had asked for, but even after he emphatically told her she had cut enough off the length, she continued to take some off. i understand needing to even put things, but this wasn't the case.  he doesn't hate it, but it is much shorter than he requested and once again that falls squarely on the stylist not listening to the client."
walked in 30mins before close and they still took me in. amazing service. her name was sonia that cut my hair. she was very nice. i would come here again to get a trim :)
"this place has always been crap. i stopped going 4 years ago but had a coupon and took my self and son in for cuts. the hairstylist who cut my hair was so nice and i felt i could trust her. yeah, conversation was diversion tactic so you don't pay attention to a crappy haircut! so uneven and missed most of the split ends on the ""trim"" i asked for. my sons hairstylist asked about a million times how it should be cut. i gave her straight forward and simple instructions; short on sides and a little longer on top so he could spike it up if he wanted to. i told her we don't know the numbers, please stop asking. she said, ""well, the computer says...."" and i reminded her at least a dozen times that we hadn't been in since my son was 4 and that styles have changed - so we do not go by what the computer notes say. she chopped his hair so uneven, we have to just let it grow out or shave it off. i have never gotten good haircuts here. serves me right for being cheap and trying it on a coupon. the prices are terribly high for the crap you get."
"i like coming here because it's fast and unpretentious and they don't try to up sell you to death on hair product. (i buy all mine at ulta, and i don't need any ever because i'm a product addict, just fyi.) today chanel cut my hair and she did a fabulous job. she listened to me and understood what i wanted. she also didn't chastise me for abusing my hair with a flat iron. and the price is right, $25 out the door for cut, shampoo and tip."
"this place always has no wait, is sanitary, has a friendly staff, and they take their time with the hair cuts to make sure it is done right! they do an overall fantastic job! i've been coming to this location for 6 months and i will continue to do so! they also have discounts for military and returning customers! highly recommended!"
"they are offering 3$ off if you write a yelp review... trying to up their rating i guess.place was clean, no wait, no issues with the online check in. the staff was friendly as well.haircut was crap as always. uneven cut, sideburns were way high and uneven as well. again, spent twice as much to get a worse haircut. there are so many other places in la mesa that do better for less.... only reason i went today was because my normal place was closed today.... poor planning on my part so i'll walk around with my badge of shame until it grows back."
"terrible period!!! watch out for tomasa - tommy, she'll tear up your looks. i would rate this place a big fat 0!"
"very frustrating to call ahead to this place to see if the person who cuts your hair is going to be there and when you show up they're not, again. same person was supposed to order product for me and text us when it came in, haven't heard from her."
"this place is pretty hit and miss. i had a new girl cut my hair today. it was a pretty bad experience , one of the worst hair cuts i have ever had. i also asked her to wash my hair after the hair cut to get off all the hair she was just cutting and dropping on top of my head.  she squirted my head with cold water for about 10 seconds and said ok all your set! sending me out the door with tons of hair all over my head and face."
just got my hair done here. was really satisfied with the outcome. very good and fast service. i asked for a fade and my fade ended up nicer than i thought. i definently reccomend this place. very good service and price!
"i came here to cut off my hair and donate it to locks of love. while they don't donate the hair themselves anymore, they were still happy to cut it for me to take home and send. my hair dresser was caroline. i had some old color on my layers underneath and they let me know that, because of that, it might not be donatable. but they weren't finished. they talked with me and we figured out a solution. after that part was done, she continued to cut my hair to the pixie cut i wanted. she was very personable and nice. she made sure multiple times that i liked the way she was cutting my hair. she was really caring about me as a person rather than just a head of hair to cut. i'm definitely going back to caroline for all my next haircuts!"
"when we walked in, there was one stylist giving a haircut to the only customer present. we were not acknowledged. as we were sitting, i did notice a computer screen showing the waitlist which was empty. after a few minutes, a couple of people came in and sat poking at their phones. then a couple more. one of the new arrivals was acknowledged by the stylist who asked if he had checked in online. it was then that i noticed 4 names now appearing on the waitlist. another customer entered at this time and she added him to the waitlist. then she asked us if we had checked in online. i said no. she then put us last on the list. the screen said our wait time would be approximately an hour. then she called the first name on the precious list. we had already been waiting 20 minutes. there had been no one on the waitlist when we arrived, and no one waiting. we were invisible customers who needed a good lesson in their system of checking in online. we left. won't be back."
"this is my favorite place to get hair. the staff are great and i never have any problems. my favorite is the manager heather. shes super fun to talk to while i get my cut, and always makes my hair look better than what i thought it would look like."
"i had gone back to this haircut shop as to where a chubby gal named ""stephonie"" did my last haircut, well she talked so much about her kids i felt she never paid attention to my hair. i asked for a layered haircut but she thinned it out and now it is uneven, a total mess. i wanted ""mousse"" to be put in my hair afterwards but she scrunched it with ""men's gel"".this was a total ""no win"" situation for me and my family of five will not go back there again. she was not pleasant @ all when it came time to pay. she tried to ring me up for a blow dry but i reminded her it was the client before me who had a blow dry. not only a rotten haircut but then to get gypped."
"shame on you! my stylist lucia is back at the santee great clips location. when i called that lady i spoke with, whom i believe is the manager, lied and said she didn't know where she went. in the future, my other family members may have used your location. my whole family is in this area. but since it has never been comfortable(owner walking through barking) and you can feel the stress at this location and now you flat out lied, we will not be back!"
"tammie, or tommie, is the manager and the worst hairdresser they have. when you get a horrible haircut, how can you complain and get satisfaction. she doesn't listen to what you want and argues with you about anything you question about the haircut. mine was uneven and crooked on the hairline. she only wants to work fast and get you in and out. don't make the mistake of wasting your money here."
"april 27th, probably the worst service i have ever gotten. i got seated and she asked what i wanted and i asked if i could start with a number 3 on the sides first and shorten it to a 2 if it was too long but she said no. i was confused on why she said no. she did it anyway and gave me a taper down to a 1 1/2 but i didn't even ask for it to be tapered to a 1 1/2. i then asked if she could make that taper to a 1 but she flipped out and was complaining that i was changing my mind too much. i kindly asked if the other lady in the room could do it for me but the lady cutting my hair got even more mad that i said that. she ended up doing it for me anyway. after the haircut, she started mumbling to herself and complaining under her breath. if i could get a refund, i would. long story short, don't get your haircut here lol"
"finally!  a person who listens to what i want!  i recommend jasmine.  i recently moved here, and have gone through several  peeps who had their idea of what i wanted, instead of what i wanted.  i will return.i will say, if the staff there misleads me again as to when my new friend is working, i will stop going there.  when i called in, i was told that she would be there.  turns out when i got there, it was her day off.  i don't reward people who lure me in just to get bucks...  if it happens again, i will move on."
fast and easy to set up an appointment with the iphone app. nice staff with reasonable prices for a regular men's cut and shampoo.
"they only get two stars because they were polite, however my low fade skin was more like a high ""fade"" and they had to switch me to a different chair because the first lady couldn't to a skin fade.  i'll stick to the base barber shop after this. not recommended for military cuts..."
jasmine was a great hair stylist. i've been to this location a few times never once had a bad e ample. will be going back and recommend this location. thanks jasmine
"despite the bad reviews for for this, i decided to give it a try because i thought maybe people were being biased! but i regretted it immediately! i specifically told her i wanted a trim and chopped off 6 inches of my hair... not sure if there was a language barrier or if she was mentally impaired! and the worst part was i told her i wanted ""layered"" hair because my hair is thin and fine and now my hair is all choppy! like who gave this woman her license? i can't believe i paid a fortune in hopes to have a professional cut my hair but i end up looking like a drag queen."
"my boyfriend gets his haircut by lucia and usually loves it, so i decided to give this place a try.  jasmine cut my hair, maybe spent 10 min on it and it's choppy, uneven all over and one side in the front is noticibly longer.  probably one of the worst haircuts i've had.  when she asked if i wanted layers i said no and thank goodness.  i'll be heading somewhere else today to have it fixed."
its all about jasmine! love my hair after coming here as a walk in . found myself asking jasmine to be my stylist as soon as i saw her- her hair style was en trende and her smile and manners were welcoming despite how busy she was. she listened to what i requested and followed through in an amazing amount of time. i'll be back for her. best deal in town!
melanie gave me an awesome style and cut today. highly recommend her for any future style or cuts. she has a great personality and is very attentive to detail. will definitely be coming back!
"went in for the first time because i received a coupon so i figured i'd try them for my son's haircut. he is a year and a half and my friend who is a hair stylist has cut his hair before. because of her busy schedule and the convenient location of this place we went in. seems that the older lady with dark hair and glasses has been there for a while because i read some of the bad reviews today and they seem to be about her. she is grumpy and rude. i walked in first then my husband with our son. my husband accidentally left the door open and the first thing the grump said was 'the door.' that was her way of asking us to close the door behind us. she should just stay in the back. she is probably not the best person to have at the front desk when customers come in and check-in. we were however greeted by the lady who was working to the right closest to the door. she seemed to be the only nice happy person there.  another older lady hair stylist became available and took us. i sat down with my son on my lap. now, this is not my son's first haircut so i know how it should be. the hairstylist seemed annoyed from the beginning. she didnt try to talk to my son or try to slowly start cutting his hair. instead, she just turned on her trimmer, grabbed the top of his head all crazy and went at it. he's a baby so of course he's gonna get scared. she didnt say one word the whole time.  but, the happy lady in the front who had a customer was talking to my son instead. my son's haircut is ok, there's a little patch in the back of his head though. i think i'll stick to my friend cutting his hair or try one of the haircut places designed for kids.if we do ever decide to return for whatever reason, i will definitely go to the lady closest to the door who seemed nice and happy."
"last night was the first time and will be the last time that i bring my son to this place. despite the bad reviews, i still wanted to give it a try, because of the location and their opening hours to 9 pm. just as another review mentioned, people there are not very happy. the  person who cut his hair looked very miserable. the result of her work is awful. the worst hair cut ever had for my son. i had to make apology to my son multiple times, as i took him there. and this place is not cheap either. unless you know someone there is good, it doesn't worth the risk."
went there for my first time recently. location is great. i highly recommend melanie. she is friendly and cares.
the check in app is useless as it showed me 26 mins wait and when i arrived after 30 mins it's still showed 16 mins. also a very overpriced place for the quality of hair cut. you are better off going to a $7 haircut place than coming here.
"on occasion, i come here for my kids to get their haircuts, but it's pretty much because it's the closest place and they're open until 9pm.  they are overpriced unless you have a $9.99 coupon, or one of those promo discount cards you can buy from local high school students for fundraising...with those you get $2 off, so it's still $14 for a basic cut and no shampoo.  the stylists sometimes make you second guess your style requests.  i don't appreciate that especially when i show them a photo of what i want for my boys.  it's like they don't want to put any effort into the style for kids.  nobody seems happy to be working there either.  that's the vibe i get anyway.  2 stars for convenience."
"i have been here in last 4 years at least 15 times. and every time i come i experience the customer service less better than the previous time! i got in today and no one said ""welcome to great clips"". however all the white people that came in after me get to hear that !!many a times i have been asked questions like - where am i from ? where do i work ? am i an engineer ? lot of engineers from india. 4s ranch lot of indians. and rather than focusing on my hair cut i have to involve myself into such unwanted conversations! sweetie .. i am just looking for a decent hair cut !! if you choose to hold scissors and i choose to hold books in my hand .. there is nothing much i can do about it ! we need a re-org / new leadership for sure!"
michael - really nice haircut and attention to detail.  i'll go back again when in san diego.
"second time here and they were great again! evelyn helped me out today and she was super helpful (and friendly)! we consulted for 10 minutes and it took about 20 minutes to cut. she kept asking me what i thought about this and that, making sure i was happy with what she was doing. 5 stars to evelyn :)"
lauren and everyone else that works here are solid gold. can't find a nicer place to get a hair cut.
great clips always makes us look pretty! shohreh is awesome- my husband looks like a new man when comes out with his new haircut.
"definitely stay away. i made the mistake of coming here, but i hope you take your $20 elsewhere. a lady cut my hair and i gave her pictures for reference but she simply could not understand the style i was hoping for. and the style i wanted was what i already had, just a shorter trimmed version. her manager can see this so he comes out (really nice white guy) and pulls her aside to explain how to perform this experiment (for her it truly was, an experiment) on my head but she completely misses the mark, and then tells me towards the end that she needs to go get her glasses because she could never see the picture clearly. this is the part of the experiment where the scientist realizes that he did not in fact find a cure to cancer for humans, instead for snails. he was looking at snails the whole time. he simply forgot to wear his glasses. good for the snails though. i was left dumbfounded and so i curtly mention on her return that maybe glasses before the cut next time (if ever i am truly feeling clinically insane to decide to come back) would be better. in a dismissive tone i hear ""oh it's okay honey, you have everything to gain nothing to lose as your hair will grow back!"" this is like going to the bakery, eating rotten bread, and being told ""but food poisoning only lasts a couple of days!"" it's cool though, i guess she's right, it'll grow back, can't argue there no i can't, but i'll need to be able to explain why i resemble a hairless cat.notable mentions: - bald spot on the back of my head. looks botched. but it will grow back, right?! perhaps a new motto for you greatclips. ""we're not sorry it will grow back"" - the lady seemed insufferable. she is angry at the world. not to downplay her own problems, however, they can be fair and real, just simply not appropriate for the workplace. i'm scared of her around sharp objects, to say the least. - she asked if i was doing ""okay"" at least 15 times. a ""yes"" each time was politely replied but i was most certainly lying by the 7th one. excessive. - she asked me to read out the expiry on my coupon as, of course, she could not see it,  because yes her glasses were off again. a wild experience. customer service and the service itself is embarrassing, please don't make the mistake of coming here."
"what am i doing here ?? spur of the moment...thanks to fellow elite yelper, kenna h. for recommending this place !!! oh wait it's been years since i've been here. location/setting:-located at a shopping center near bbb and ralphs-plenty of parking-small hair salon (don't expect high-end decor)-there is a check-in monitor/screen that tells you where you are on the waiting list. nice feature. they call your name when it's your turn.customer service:-the young lady who greeted me seemed liked the unhappiest person on earth. geez. a smile wouldn't hurt.-my hairdresser was quite pleasant though. i think her name was evelyn..a nice older filipina lady.-i usually am iffy about these places..i mean you get what you pay for, but i just wanted a trim and she did a pretty good job. through dying and flat ironing, i was having hair dilemmas. i had major dry split ends so i wanted a mini hair makeover. she was very attentive and wanted to make sure that i knew exactly what she was going to do. i wanted to keep my hair medium length. she took off a good 3 inches and cleaned up my layers from before. i must say it made a huge difference. my dead ends are gone ! yay !-i also had her shampoo my hair. great mini massage too. the whole process took less than 30 minutes.additional info:-for $20 not too shabby. i wish i had a coupon. i hear they have $5 off coupons all the time so keep an eye out for those.-if you check-in online (or use great clips app.), you won't have to wait too long, but since this was a random spur of the moment thing, i had to wait for 15-20 minutes on a saturday. not too bad considering there were a few people ahead of me already seated in the waiting area.- convenient ! you're in and out quick so it's great if you're in a rush.- reasonable hours - open 7 days/weekverdict:i got lucky this time around. i'm sure it's a hit or miss depending on who you get. if you aren't too picky with haircuts (keep it simple) and in a rush then i'm sure they can do a decent job. don't expect high end salon treatment. they want you in and out."
shohreh is the bomb! she does fantastic cuts! can always count on her. she's my girl!
shohreh is awesome!!!! she is a pro & gives a meticulous haircut!! the wait for her is always worth it. she listens & does exactly what you request. so lucky to have found her!! have been going  to her for the past 6 years. people stop me all the time & ask me where i get my haircut. her expertise is reflected in the professional haircuts she gives. she is also a beautiful & wonderful person!!! thank you shohreh!!!
my wife just got her haircut (she thinks the person's name was kendra) and said the hairstylist was very nice and did a great job communicating everything she was doing.
"i've been going to rich for years now, although he is in various locations and i have to track him down when i need a cut.  i have total strangers stop me frequently when i am out and about admiring my cut and asking where i get it done.  i always recommend great clips for the price and results."
i've gone there several times. was ok in the past but lately has gone downhill. if you want a bad haircut chances are you will get one there...
"had such a wonderful experience here. i had the luck of having rich cut my hair and i am beyond happy with not only the cut he did but the amazing person that he is. great salon, awesome service and incredible haircut! i came from an hour away and will continue to do so as long as rich is around!"
"due to numerous bad haircut experiences, i had pretty much given up on going to any more great clips locations. but i'm glad i gave it one more try. richard, the general manager at this location, also cuts hair. i've used him a couple of times and he gets it right. so now i just call ahead and will only go when he's working. since they don't take appointments, i just let him know when i'll be there and then check in online. no more crooked or too short haircuts for me. the parking lot here gets crowded.they accept competitor's coupons, as long as they're not expired. as long as richard is working here, i'll continue to come here. thanks for the great and affordable haircut!"
sarah has been cutting my hair for several months now. when i relocated to del sur it took quite a few tries to find someone who would pay attention to the way i want my hair cut. sarah is very attentive and consistently cuts my hair as i request.
"warning...there is an incompetent hairdresser on the loose at this salon and her name is christina.  she lost control of her razor and failed to point this out to my son and never showed him the back of his head. shame on you christina! at least be an adult and inform your clients' of your mistakes.  it wasn't until he drove home when we noticed the two bald spots. not only is she incompetent with  the razor but also shares inappropriate information with clients. my son said when another male customer walked into the salon she said, ""phew, glad i didn't get him, he is too picky"".  i'm guessing he too once suffered under the sheers of christina.consider yourself warned."
"if i could put a 0* i would. i've never seen my husband's hair like this. it's completely uneven all around his head. maybe they should clip dog hair?  anyways, not going back for sure!"
"my fiancé came and got a haircut here yesterday. the person who cut his hair was ngoc. she did not do a good job w his hair. we came home and i saw that his hair was uneven! she completely missed the right side of his head. i didn't go in w him the first time and i didn't see it initially since i wasn't there. we came back in to get it fixed and she didn't even remember cutting his hair. then, she was unhappy to fix it!i showed her where it was uneven and she said ""no, it's straight. you see?"" as she continues to cut his hair. if it's even like you claimed...then why are you still cutting? then once she was done ""fixing"" it, she started cleaning her clippers as he sat there in the chair. we were not even sure if he was done because she didn't say anything except looked angry and left him hanging. we will not be back. terrible service. avoid ngoc at all cost. she will mess up your hair!"
"another spur of the moment hair adventure !!!i never noticed this place existed. it's been here for a few years and i've been going to studio barre classes next door. doh ! like other great clips locations, it's a hit or miss on who you get if you don't have a regular hairstylist. i decided to take that risk again since i had a good experience at another location.location:-easy to find; off the 56 freeway-plenty of parking-small and clean saloncustomer service:-friendly, fast, and efficienti didn't have an appointment booked nor did i check-in online. i was expecting a wait, but surprisingly i was called in right away. it was also thursday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all. the lady at the front greeted me and took my information. apparently, they didn't have my record in the system even though i've been to another great clips. they are all connected.my hairstylist was renee (i think) and she was super down to earth and cool as can be !! she had a very hip hairdo that i personally couldn't get away with, but she rocked it ! i was considering going drastic myself, but instead opted for a few inches off instead. haha i know..boring !!!i am super low maintenance when it comes to my hair. recently, i've stopped dying and flat ironing my hair since it was drying out and causing me to get major split ends. i'm finally nurturing my hair back into good health. renee was open to hearing about my concerns and trimmed off more of my split ends and added more layers to my hair. in my opinion, medium-length hair seems to suit me best rather than long hair. i got a nice shampoo/conditioner and massage as well. throughout the whole process, renee was very professional with hair recommendations and i easily trusted her judgement. it was super quick and i was in and out in less than 30 minutes. great for those who are in a rush. don't get me wrong though. she was meticulous and knew what she was doing. i was very pleased.total came to $20 plus tip. not too shabby ! i have yet to find those great clips coupons everyone is talking about.if ever i want a simple cut, i will never go to a high-end salon for that anymore. great clips does a decent job for a fraction of the price."
"i take my boys here exclusively for their hair cuts. there's a reason. they get the job done right. you can check-in online using their app. and it shortens the wait because you can come in when you think they'll call you. the app will tell you there's a 30 minute wait, for example, and you can adjust your arrival time accordingly. they almost always get you in, if you checked-in online, at the time they estimated for your wait.also, they take competitor's coupons, but no coupons printed off the internet.  so be aware and look through those free mailers that come to your house. i almost always use a coupon and always tip well because frankly, they deserve it!"
"yikes, hubby came home piiiiiiiiiissssssed. i have never seen him so upset over a haircut before. as my last review stated, christina was the only good person he had here (pq/rb never gave him good haircuts) but she left a long time ago. so he went back today, i guess to give them another chance, plus he had a coupon.he had the middle aged asian lady worker who barely spoke english, and didn't listen to anything he said of how he wanted his haircut. he has super easy hair to cut, by the way.she took way too much off and he told her that she didn't listen to anything i said. no apology, no nothing (probably cuz she couldn't understand him lol)...he came in the house and i told him ""honey, wear a hat for the next couple of weeks"" lol....this should've been comped. i saw the haircut. no way he should've paid for that garbage. and i can't believe he still tipped her. my hubby is way too nice. personally, i would've complained to the manager. he is still pissed lol i better give him some cookies to calm him down.he said he will never go back there ever again...but he said it in more colorful language. all right yelpers, you've been warned."
"took my 2 year old there today for a hair cut. he was being a normal child who doesn't like hair cuts! crying a lot but i was holding him. the hairdresser said ""is it nap time?"" ""you are being crazy"" to my son. she was very rude to him and i. didn't deserve to get paid at all for her words. if you cant handle cutting children's hair then don't!!"
"i *always* know there *must* be a gimmick when you see a haircut being flashed around for only $8.99. there must be a 'read fine print' somewhere. or maybe there should be that fine print somewhere on all their $8.99 haircut banners. we were in this shopping plaza the other day and the bf wanted a quick hair cut. he's been to sports clip which he likes. i think he said their haircuts start at $20.it was pretty busy at this great clips location that early afternoon. we went in and i inquired about the $8.99 price. the young receptionist, who was nice, asked us to fill out an info card which i politely declined as we were only there asking about the price and there's no need for them to get our personal info. she still didn't know the details about the $8.99 so she asked one of the stylist. the young girl then said yes, $8.99 for a haircut. i asked if that included a shampoo perhaps? and she had to ask another stylist who whispered to her 'no, it's haircut only'. i think a shampoo is an additional $4-6 dollars or so. alright. no biggie. there's the fine print for me. fine. she quoted a 15 min wait so we put our name in (and yes filled out info card) and went next door to peet's to grab a coffee. 10 min later we came back and was told another 10-15 min. jeez. when it was bf's turn to get haircut, it didn't take long (maybe 12-15 min). he said he was happy with the haircut and the girl was pleasant & friendly. we found it pretty cute they handed him a hand(pre)written thank you card with a discount card also included. nice touch. bf said that he'd give the place 4 stars for the cut but agreed 3 stars for initial confusion (of price) and longer wait than what was quoted. i didn't realize this place takes online reservations (?) so maybe that's the way to go when you visit this location."
"zachary is ""the best"" for my husband who is 87.  he's patient and goes the extra mile by not rushing, making sure my husband's ideas are possible, and even trims his eyebrows and ears without asking.  he's so kind, as well as accomplished in what my husband wants, that we've followed him around to various locations for a few years now."
"i'll never go back there again! the barber cut off more than i asked. this happened twice and it was by the same person. i wasn't happy with the haircut back in june.  i went there 2 days ago hoping to get somebody else, but she was the only one available at that time. i decided to give her another chance. to avoid any misunderstanding i repeated my request to cut half an inch off the top part of my hair. i emphasized repeatedly ""no more than half an inch!"" but, what did she do? she cut off way too much again! you fool me once, shame on you. fool me twice,...never that place again!!!"
amara is very outgoing and comforting! i came in clueless about my hair but she gave me so much helpful information! ask for her when you come in here! the place is very welcoming and clean! will definetly return!
"i went in yesterday - feb 2 around 4:30 ish to get a simple trim done . i was greeted by christina who asked me to fill out a info card since it was my first time there . i only went here bc it's around the corner from my house and my dad recommended it. i was seated within 15 from me walking in and melania took care of me - she was amazing and listened to what i wanted. i'm giving it a 2 star due to christina making a racist comment to melania. melania is from columbia and like any other immigrant has an accent when speaking english . as melania spoke christina decide to say "" what are you saying ? speak english "" - mind you everyone understood what melania said. i turned around and did give christina a dirty look and said that was unnecessary. then christina decided to say that melania reminded her of a child learning to speak for the first time- that's when i was ready to go. i don't tolerate any type of racism or down playing someone's intelligence . first of all-i'm an immigrant and i took it very personal due to my own experiences. secondly, this is your job - act professional. thirdly, christina if this is what you teach your kids at home be ready for a rude awakening."
"okay, so i got my hair cut each month here for about two years. why am i rating them two stars (and never going back ever again)? they have about 2-3 good staff members and the rest are a major inconvenience. rookies to people who can barely speak english, you name it. just go somewhere else."
ive been coming to great clips for a long time now and just had the manager cut my kids hair. zachary was so amazing with all my kids. we will definitely be back and i highly recommend this great clips and zachary.
i reviewed this place 22 days ago but it's not showing up. i popped in today since i was next door getting coffee and the air conditioning is still broken. it felt like a swet shop in there. how dare they make the staff work in those conditions. the girl told me it was 88degrees inside.
i started going here for convenient location but have since come to realize their service is great too.   i highly recommend.
milena was very nice and efficient in giving my haircut on a sunday morning (they save my settings too)!
"i never notice this place before, but i was in dire need of a haircut and dropped in without an appointment.  they took me in right away and put me in the hands of kirsten (sp?), a young lady from texas.  she did exactly what i asked for, and actually improved on it just a little.  best haircut i have had in 10 years.  i will definitely be back.  this is my new favorite place for haircuts,"
"my three kids have been going to zach at torrey highlands for about 3 hair cuts and he has always done an excellent job!  we like him so much that we followed him from another great clips that is closer to us.  he is kid friendly, precise, efficient, and we love their hair when it is done.  we check in with the app and hardly have to wait.  today my 2nd son was already getting his hair cut by the time my daughter  and i walked in."
great service today from natsumi.  her technique was exceptional with exacting skill and attention to detail.   she is our good to stylist at great clips!
"this review is in regards to a visit to this location on october 5, 2017.  i checked in as usual through the app and arrived at the salon around 12:15pm.at this time there were two women working, one with longer green-black hair and tattoos and another slightly older with shorter grayish hair.  the older woman finished cutting her clients hair, had him pay, and then immediately said ""ok sir, i'm ready. you can come on back.""i followed her back and just as i expected from the immediate turn around the floor was just covered in hair from at least 1 haircut but it looked like more.  there was also a neck ribbon or two lying among all the hair.  i stood back a few feet to give her the opportunity to clean up, as i assumed she may have just forgot and wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt.  after about 10-15 seconds she looks at me (which she stands in piles of hair) and says ""are you coming?"".  at this point i said ""i can't do this."" and walked out, absolutely disgusted.  after a minute i decided it would be best to go back in to provide feedback as a courtesy.  all she said was ""are you ready?"" the floor was still covered in hair with zero attempt to clean up.  when i stated my concern she said ""you never gave me a chance to clean up."" which is a brazen lie.  that is exactly why i stood back in the first place.i am not a germaphobe or someone with a compulsive aversion to unclean situations, but i was dumbfounded (not to mention this is a california health code violation).  my grandmother owned a small salon in rural ohio for almost 40 years and my mother owned another for many years.  i have grown up in them and pride myself on always appreciating the hard work stylists put in.  this experience has also primed me as to what i should expect from a salon and this is not it.i have been going to great clips for nearly 10 years in 2 different states and this is far and away the worst experience i have ever had with this (or any other) salon.  i can say with certainty i will never again venture to this location."
first time going to this place.i would go back any day they give really good haircuts! the people here are very friendly and do there job very well.crystal does amazing work she is a very good hair stylist....
"when you get home and have to fix your own hair, you know it's a bad haircut.  i don't know if the ""stylist"" was having a bad day but she didn't seem to care about my hair for one second.  i asked for a few touch ups and she balked at my suggestions stating that my hair will look bad.  well, my hair did look bad.  as i was driving home, i reached to the back of my head to find a huge clump of hair that she clearly missed.  on top of that, she missed a few other spots that i could easily identify with just a mirror and a comb at my house.  i would highly advise to look anywhere else.  the only reason it isn't 1 star is the tv in the waiting area is a nice touch."
"crystal is amazing!!! i seriously only let her touch my hair. i could go anywhere to get my hair cut but why would i when she is the best! i couldn't be happier that i don't have to spend an arm and leg at some fancy salon, yet get even better results than when i have. crystal just happens to manage great clips, but i would follow her anywhere. she knows exactly what and how i want my hair, as i'm extremely particular. i am forever being complimented on her work. thank you crystal for being a part of making me feel beautiful! i'll be seeing you soon!"
"if i could leave 0 stars i would. i have been trying to grow my hair out for over a year to have an asymetrical angled bob. today was going to be the day..... psych!i usually see a nice black lady but she gave me to a fat white lady with glasses. which i didnt mind. i figured since i am fat too she would give me the cut i wanted and make me look good for my interview i haad later that day. we discussed what i wanted. i was very clear, stacked in back, angled to my jaw on the right and angled and just take off the dry end on the left. she said she would have to take off maybe an inch on the left... shorter than i wanted but fine. i waited forntgis haircut for a year. my hair grows super slow.first i had to ask for a shampoo, she was just going to spray my unwashed hair down.shampoo done, she has to use the restroom. fine, she took like 10 minutes in the restroom. whatever... nature calls you gotta answer.she then combs my hair and clips and reclips my hair. finally starts cutting. she cutsbthe back then on to the short side. she cuts that super blunt and not angled.she goes to the long side and tells me she can't do it. what?! what do you mean you can't do it?? she said it will have to be a lot shorter on the long side. i told her i didnt wantbit to look like my haed was cocked when it was cut. i wanted a visable difference. after she cut the long side shorter, it looked maybe a half inch longer than the short side. i was upset and told her just to even out the cut. i started crying. she didnt notice and just kept cutting and finally asked if i was crying, really you needed to ask? i looked up and saw she also cut blunt with no angle. i started crying harder. she asked what was wrong. i told her this was not the cut i wanted, it was not angled in front, and she started to argue with me. seriously telling me that i never told her that i wanted angeld sides.i got up and told her we were done. threw some money on her station and proceeded to take the cape off.the black lady offered to try and fix it nut i had no more time and my hair was entirely too short now, so i didn't want any more cutting.horrible experience! you never argue or patronize the person in the chair. i have been a hairdresser for 10 years and what she told me was incorrect. it could have been done, an experienced hairdresser knows how to do it. now i have another year of growing out to do.thanks."
"my experience at this location was very good. i had frankie for my stylist, and she was great. she definitely made me feel like more than just an ordinary customer and genuinely interested in actually getting to know me as a person. i will definitely be back."
great customer service here!!! no wait when other shops had over an hour. stephanie did a wonderful job with my son as he gets ready to go into high school. he looks great and she gave the exact cut he wanted.tina did my hair and exceeded my expectations as she trimmed my ear hair and eyebrows. this was the first haircut shop in which i experienced this style of customer service. we'll definitely return to this location for our hair cuts. tina also gave us a discount. well done ladies!!!
"frankie is a great stylist/haircutter for a few special reasons. she has a fabulous eye for what style would work for​ a person. she listens to me and allows​ me to offer my sometimes ""not so good ideas"" and follows my wishes. when i realize i didn't make the best choice she just gets me back on the right track. all of this with a smile and a caring attitude. i trust her with her choices for me and that means a great deal! like others, my appearance is very important to my sense of self-worth​. i get so many compliments about my haircut. so glad i found her. she is great to talk to as well (smile)."
among the worst visits to a hair cut spot. lady just read some notes in her computer from my last visit 2yrs ago. did not ask me how i would like it cut... did not ask me if i was happy after the cut... which by the way took less than 15mins. no artistic effort - just chop chop!  the lady wore glasses and squinted a bunch - i'm not going back. 2 stars because at least the place was clean and plenty of parking.
"i came here without an appointment. haircuts are $17, child and seniors are $15. the place is very clean and organized. the haircut station is on the left hand side and shampooing station is on the right hand side. they clean up the hair after every client and they greet you as soon as you walk in. today was kind of busy considering the long weekend and everyone is trying to look sharp for the bbq pool party tomorrow! :) i had britney today and she was very good and bubbly. i will be happy to return! my hair looks great and healthy again!"
"great location, and crystal is the best! she's always quick to respond and does an outstanding job every time."
"great place really, i'm pretty particular about my hair. i never thought great clips would be my regular to-go place. i always get skin fades and ""trickier"" cuts, which atendestes hard to find to satisfaction for around $20. but every time i come in i leave with a smile on my face because the girls here do a great job! very nice and professional people. definitely look for frankie, she did the best fade last time i was there. thumbs up for people who actually care what your hair looks like."
i've been here a few times and they've always done a great job.  my boyfriend comes here regularly and only once did some girl do a funky job but that's pretty good considering how often he's gone.today i donated hair and they were really careful with making the measurements.  i also got my hair cut for free because they are a locks of love salon.  ann helped me and she was very mindful of the exact length i wanted.  she suggested layers and i love them.  she was great.i really don't understand going to expensive places for a cut.  this place is just as good!
"i stopped here to get my sons hair cut.  the lady who helped him wasn't very polite at all.  she kept hersef busy texting on th phone and talking to her colleague while trying to cut my boys hair.  i don't mind if they have to answer the stores phone calls but its very unprofessional to be on their personal cell phone while taking care of a customer.  hair cut was messy, not the way we wanted it and she did not even bother to clean the hairs around his ears, neck and forehead... not nice."
"had to get a haircut before my drill weekend. i got a 2 on the sides and a 4 on the top with a line up. i stopped in and the woman that cut my hair did an absolutely horrible job she spent about 15 minutes, my lineup was literally uneven, my hair looked ragged. why did i allow this to happen? she didn't even provide me with a hand mirror to inspect the cut, she instantly put gel on her palms, slicked my hair into a comb over and charged me $14 with what she said was a ""great price for military"" and apparently $18 regular. do not come here.. save yourself the trouble and drive up balboa to amdine barber shop. they have great service, great reviews and consistent quality."
"i recommend this place for my mother not too long ago, i had a fairly good experience. well, she told me the blonde lady who cut her hair kept telling my mother how tiring it was to cut her hair. um, isn't that your job?  how disrespectful and unprofessional. keep your thoughts to yourself."
i love getting my hair cut here. the stylists are all so friendly and do an amazing job. i've been to so many different hair cutting places and great clips (this one in particular) is by far the most affordable and you leave feeling like a million bucks!  i feel lucky that this place is so close to where i live.  thanks ladies!!!
got the military cut with a 2 on sides on longer on top. the woman who cut my hair said she had 37 years of experience...i got home and my hair line was jacked. none of my fade was even and the blending was awful. worst haircut i've ever received. i went up to the scripps ranch location and luckily they fixed it for me for free. i don't do yelp reviews much so that tells you how awful this cut was!
trang did an awesome job on my hair. at first i was nervous because i'm new to town and it was my first haircut in san diego. when she was done i was a little bit skeptical because she did it so quickly but i have friends telling me it's one of the best haircuts i've ever had. she saw that i wasn't happy at first and told me i didn't have to pay. i felt bad because she did a great job. i'll definitely go back to her again.
"i've come in to this great clips location twice in the last few months, and all i have to say is wow.the first time i came in was to fix a haircut that was done poorly by another (not great clips) shop. christiano did an amazing job fixing it, and even though it was busy i was in and out quickly.the second time i came in was for a normal haircut and it was months later. christiano remembered me personally and once again the service was fantastic. he even trimmed my beard. i will continue going here for my cuts, and highly recommend them!"
this place is awesome!!! walked in and was out in no time!!! the staff is amazing and the price was great. christiano (manager) has a phenomenal personality and his staff is very kind and helpful. we shared some laughs and i totally felt like i was at home. my best hair experience here in california by far! this is a great cohesive team on the rise. thank you so much christiano for the trim and layers!!! keep up the great work :) morgan witherspoon
i came in and did not realize the coupon was a week expired. they did not honor the coupon. i ended up paying $18 for the hair cut. with tips i paid $20 for a hair cut. i am cheap. i've never paid for more than $15 hair cut.
this great clips is well...great! the staff was friendly on the phone and when i arrived. they are also knowledgable and cut my hair well. i felt welcome and that my business was appreciated. online check in was very convenient. i will definitely be returning.
"this may be a great hidden secret for a good, reasonable hair cut. i took my son to this location late one weeknight because the great clips we usually go to had a 23 minute wait. so we checked-in online at this location close to our house. there was no one in there except for the two hair stylists. ruben cut my son's hair. he did an amazing job. he knew exactly what to do to make my son's hair look good and i didn't have to tell him much of anything. just confirmed his usual.i made sure to find out when he works and he told me that he usually works nights. great. i'll plan on coming back with my other son!"
very nice haircut place i always come here . zakia was super nice and took the best care of me . i got a fresh haircut and will be back!super fast too
"i just got home with my son and i want to cry. i explained to the lady who called us to her chair that he has autism and doesn't always respond to verbal commands......she then took it upon herself to buzz his head, she had already run the clippers across his head before i could even utter a word. we never ask for clippers because my son has a few cowlicks and keeping it a bit longer helps. i walked in to show my neighbor and she immediately noticed all the uneven areas on his head. i would go complain but he's 3 and it will grow back. i just know now i need a new place to take him."
got a great haircut from cheri at great clips tonight. she knows how to blend the sides to the top really well. i got exactly the haircut i wanted and my wife liked it too. always a plus.
"yelp reviews are rarely checked before one goes, eats or visits a location. it it used to find places and some will browse reviews, but most are smart enough to know that people have opinions.... and opinions are like... yada yada yada.... you know the rest.  soooo here is my opinion.   service is... ok. a few stylist that cant cut hair right to save their lives, but most are decent and a couple are really good. but not worth $18! so if i have a coupon or special... yep, i will go. otherwise you can get same service or better pretty much anywhere in the 10 mi radius of this location.  they have huge turn around here and most saturday afternoons.. its dead! so that says a lot. try for yourself... again, just my opinion."
"this place is fucking ass, i use to always go here. not anymore, i've had to redo my hair again just because people here don't know how to cut."
came here to this location for the first time and impressed with the quick service. zakia was really good. she is quick and gave me a great haircut. and also told what kinds of hairstyle i can do in future. i am definitely coming back to her
came here for the first time today on a recommendation and i was very happy with my haircut.  ruben did a great job and i really enjoyed his expertise and customer service. i'll be back. the salon was very nice and clean too.   cori went back for a second time. i was charged way too much. felt like bait and switch to me. it cost much higher than i expected because of the higher prices.  cori
"they have messed up my hair on multiple occasions, but have offered to fix it for free. might come again, prices are okay."
ive come here multiple times and i am very satisfied with the haircuts they give me. they are friendly and make you feel comfortable. i've been coming here for a while now. my hair cuts are all done by the barber rubenes never messed up my hair.
"ruben cut my hair tonight. he did a great job. i'm a previous customer from the poway location by target. due to lack of customer service and one stylist that smelled like an ash tray i am no longer going to go there. thanks ruben, best haircut i've had in a very long time!!!"
i usually don't have the best experiences when i just walk in to have my sons hair cut but when ruben cuts it.....always on point!! i hope and pray is there everytime i go.  from now on im just going to call and make sure first.  he is so personable and always doing his best to make sure everyone is happy!! ask for ruben!!!
it's so hard to find a great hair stylist!  been shuffling between various locations and people!  i got a haircut at a different location and they messed up my hair!  then came into this location the next day to get my hair redone and ruben helped me out and did a fantastic job!  he did such an awesome job i would recommend him to anyone and everyone!  still come to get my haircut and will always request ruben!  thank you great clips and especially ruben for the great fantastic haircut!!!
i have been going to this great clips since 2007 and i have to say i have been satisfied until today. today's visit was awful. i felt like i was being pressured into buying products. all i wanted was to go in for a trim and to leave. i was not only being pressured by the stylist but also by a manager which i thought was rude in more than one way. he made a comment about my gray hair that i didn't appreciate and he also was talking to my stylist about a mistake she made prior to helping me. i thought he could have waited until she was done trimming my hair before talking to her. because of these experiences i think i may find a new place.
"everyone was nice,i left thinking that the cut i had was good, until i got home. my wife pointed out a lot of big chop and uneven, just careless work. i wont be returning there.i would name the stylist but maybe she was having a bad day on my cut, none the least inexcusable.i went to your competitor to get it straightened out. tayler"
"i've been coming to the location for the last 2 months for 1 reason and 1 reason only: ruben. he cuts your hair so gently and precisely. i used to go to a different great clips location, only 5 minutes from my house, but once i heard ruben moved locations to rancho, i go here every time, even though it's 25 min from my house now."
very responsive to our needs as a family and myself as a professional working in hospital.
"i am responding to this because a couple people have unfairly characterized jacqui, a hairstylist i have been seeing for about ten years now. i simply will not allow anyone else to cut my hair. over the last ten years my hair style hasn't changed much, slight tweaks here and there to keep up with the times. but one thing that has never changed is my satisfaction with jacqui's work. i honestly can't review anyone else at this great clips because she's the only one i will see."
"i always come to this location and always end up with a great haircut and shampoo, love love this place....."
i usually go to this place for my haircuts. i'm pretty satisfied with all my haircut experiences here (4 or 5 times so far). it's clean. easy to check-in. i get my haircut by kim. she's friendly and does a good job. very comfortable place to get my simple haircut.
fast hair cut...un friendly lady...doesn't say a word...she handles the clipper and scissors like she is force to cut my hair. i will never...ever go back to that place
worst hair cut ever.asian lady is so horrible . she made my hair exotremely short. i have asked her to do something else and she has done like man hair cut. she is horrible .i m planning to complain about her to the great clips head quarter and make her fire .
"my husband took our 5 year old son to great clips for a haircut this week. they have a sign in their window saying ""military discount"" . when my husband went to pay for the haircut he showed his military id but was told the discount is not for dependants.  won't be going to great clips anymore!"
i get my hair cut here and every time i think i want to try somewhere else i end up coming back here to get my hair fixed. i have had just about everyone here cut my hair and they are all really good. i absolutely love yafa though. love. love. love. love. she is awesome! she's also really honest when i need opinions about anything so its nice talking to her while getting my hair cut. this place is really cheap for a hair cut and i really don't understand how they only have 2 stars on yelp. i don't dye my hair so i can't comment on that aspect but the cuts are solid. i also really enjoy getting the conditioning treatments here. they make my hair feel super soft and silky after. i also love that while i'm here they never try to push products on me. the staff is also very patient with all my strange and untraditional requests for random cuts here and there.
this is the worst place i have ever been too. my hair looks like a freaking lawn mower went over my head. the tall black lady(jackie) had no idea what she was doing!!! she was careless didnt even listen to what i wanted just started hacking away... not only does my hair look like crap but when she was cutting my hair she was flinging her scissors around could have cut me if they feel off her fingers. no blending done to my hair when i got home i had to have my roommates fixed all extra long areas... do not go here. i had to call and complain to the manager. horrible !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"this great clips is my hole in the wall, quick touch up spot. it's almost always not busy, very easy to just stroll in and sit right down. place is pretty clean, minus the location on the side of the strip mall. the employees are okay. not very chatty and don't look like they like what they do. i wouldn't choose this location for any major hair job. quick touch ups, yeah stop by."
"where to start? the russian woman is great, and does a good job. don't even considering seeing anyone else. they seem to train a lot of people, there are usually 2 to 4 people there who don't even know to work the clippers. my brothers haircut is usually pretty terrible, but this time it took the cake. she spent 30 minutes cutting his hair without clippers, and when she used the clippers on his neck she took a chunk out of the line and just left it. see attached picture. didn't know how to work the register, confirming that she was another trainee. there's one good woman there, but she is always busy so don't even dream about walking in and finding her available."
"ok , old ladies in as stylist they don't understand english they know traditional way of cutting onlycannot do what pictures u show them .  was not satisfied hm they did not blow drive wholly too hm"
"i've gotten my hair cut by four of the different stylist/barbers and they are without a doubt the best i've been to. i can speak from personal experience that if you get your hair cut by jackie (i know i spelled this wrong), kim or debbie you will not be disappointed. love this spot!"
"we've been coming to this great clips for a few years, and they always do a good job. my wife gets her hair cut by kim and she always loves it! for men it's fast too, and they don't try to up sell you with unnecessary stuff which is great. can't beat the price either."
we took our daughter for an emergency fix hair cut here after someone at the pb location butchered her haircut. melissa was wonderful and somehow salvaged my daughters hair. we are grateful for her help!
"kim is the best, always a good haircut. she is super friendly and does a great job. check in online and save yourself some time."
"i walked in and it was empty, so that was different from my usual hairdresser. i showed her a picture of what i wanted and told her i would like 5 inches cut off. instead of 5 inches she doubled of what i had asked for! aside from that it was nothing like the picture! besides that the hairdresser was also rude. you're better off getting a pair of scissors for home and cutting it yourself instead of spending money here. they ruined my hair, do not come here!"
"i had a very bad experience today. the lady with russian accent cut my hair today. i like my hair to be short. i have clearly mentioned 6 on the top, 2 and 1 on the sides. instead of cutting with scissors, she used a machine with 5!!!  what the heck is that. she did not put any care in cutting my hair properly. she tried to finish the job asap. i have to look into mirror and ask her to cut the hair properly. i strongly recommend to avoid this lady with russian accent."
"the price is reasonable and comparable with other barber shops for a short male-cut.i usually go to the happy barber on clairmont mesa, but this is now closer for me. this is a perfect place to take my two little kids; i can't comment on anyone but quin (formerly nguyen) who did a great job with my 3 yr old and 9 month old. with a coupon, the price is pretty much the same as happy barber. i haven't tried the online booking feature and haven't had a problem as a walk in."
literally the worst place ever for a haircut. there is a russian of slovakian lady who has no idea what she is doing at all. do not go here. ever. she botched my hair completely
"i've been here twice now and both times got major haircuts from long (10+ inches) to pixie. both times i had great experiences and was very happy with the results.samantha cut my hair this last time i went, and she was very patient taking her time on the cut and humoring my special requests. she checked in at various steps to ensure that i was on board with what she was doing, and also offered helpful suggestions from length of the bangs to styling products.would go back!"
"came here looking for a last minute haircut (short, curly hair) before school starts. we were greeted promptly and serviced after waiting less than 5 minutes. my daughter was nervous about getting a cut by a man but her nerves were quickly calmed after chatting with mark before her cut. he understood exactly what she was looking for and executed it to the t. she loved her wash and the delicate care of her cut. we will definitely be back for a cut with mark. thank you."
jessica took her time with me and gave me a great cut. my hair came out better than some cuts that i've gotten from barbers who charge twice as much. thanks jessica! i feel great
this was my first time at this location and i was in need of haircut. i wanted to do a simple medium length cut and i showed my hairstylist jessica a picture of what i wanted. she was very friendly and made great suggestions which i was open to. she gave me the cut i wanted as well as making sure it framed my face shape. in the end i liked the way it turned out and i would come back to maintain my haircut.
"if you want a bitchy stuck up woman who probably learned how to cut hair out of a coloring book, get your haircut here."
"absolutely horrendous, i walked in for a haircut and i walked out looking like an egg."
long story short.. i got a skin fade 0 to 3 on top.. but never got the fade haha came back lady looked at me like she never heard a fade before i just walked out and hit up another barber shop
terrible haircut!stylist very timid and seemed afraid to even cut hair. bad fading and edging. could have gotten a better haircut in the barracks. marines do not come here. overpriced and really bad quality.
"great service! anna was extremely efficient and quick, plus was spot on with the hair cut! will come back!!!"
"horrible hair salon..we went there for my husband's haircut , he mentioned specifically many times to keep the length and they just blindly cut everything with clipper..didnt even use scissors..why pay 20 bucks for something we can do at home only .they dont understand customer requirements at all..v disappointed.."
"jamshid did an excellent job! just got my hair cut today and i've already gotten a few compliments on it tonight. i've always had a great experience regardless of who does my hair at this location but i was especially pleased with jamshid's styling. he's cute, too."
absolutely horrible customer service! walked in was told they had people who checked in a head of me so had to check in and wait even though no one was in the store... 3 people working but two were on the computer for 15mins. told them i was gonna run to my car and they confirmed i'd be right back. then come back after not even two minutes. they had let a walk in go ahead of me and said sorry we have to take who is here when we're ready! really??    so rude! then told me i could wait another 30 mins for my sons haircut.
"got my haircut here in hopes to get rid of the dead ends and have overall healthy looking hair. i have very dry curly hair so moisturizer and a comb is needed in order to prevent breakage. you would think the stylist would be mindful since that is their profession. the women stared to brush my hair completely dry before my cut, i had to ask her to please at-least fully wet my hair thinking she would understand she's not only 1. hurting me 2. breaking my hair. she sprays my hair a few times barely making it dampand i proceed to ask for some sort of conditioning to proceed with the brushing. at this point she is not caring what so ever about being mindful of my hair. i tell her let's just wash it 4$ more but maybe with my hair fully wet she will be more gentle and not have to cause more damage. after the wash she continues to mistreat my hair. pulling at knots until they ripped! i was shocked she proceeded yanking the comb and brush throughout this process. what shocked me the most was she proceeded to cut my hair without fully combing it. i understand i have a lot of knotting and curls but that is no excuse for a half ass job. on top of everything my hair is severely shorter and not at all what i asked for. hiring stylist who are mindful of other people's needs and hair types should be top priory for hair cut salons. horrible experience ."
"our usual place closed with no warning, so we needed a new place.  this is where we ended up ... thanks to yelp.  our new stylist is zachary and he did a fabulous job for my mom and me!"
"briana cut my hair yesterday at about 2:00 pm.  there was nobody else waiting at that time.she is cute, she is experienced and she has excellent personality(also her first day at this location.)have been getting my hair cut here for about 3 years, simply out of convenience, have never had a particularly bad cut(i get buzzed with a #2 guard), but there is not a lot of art to that.briana had excellent conversation skills, and she got my hair cut with a little extra flair(great job on the sideburns) and had me finished professionally with a minimal amount of fuss.if she doesn't continue working at this location i'm going to be extremely bummed out.  she made the experience of getting my hair cut actually fun."
check in online. download the app so you can lower your wait time. makes it so much easier.
i took my two kids to get their haircut today as a walk in and the stylist are very friendly to both my kids. there is no one there when we walk in so there is no wait time. very great service
"got my hair styled today for an event, the worst job ever. what a waste of money and time.very disappointing !!!"
great haircut as usual. easy to check in and in and out in 15 minutes. keep up the good work.
i went in to get a haircut today and the asian lady cutting my hair didn't even get close to what i was wanting then she charged me more for styling it. i don't recommend this place to anyone.
"usually when i come here i always try to get denise but it's so hard to find her sometimes and i'm not sure if she still works their but she was amazing, today i went in and saw a new face his name was ben. if you come here and have the pleasure of meeting ben i suggest you wait for him! super nice and really cared about his job. don't forget to to him ! ;) thx ben"
let's start off by saying if i could give zero stars i would. my boyfriend just got home - typically cut his hair myself. 3 all around and clean up the edges. but its insanely hot so thought he could just go somewhere this once. let's just say he will not be returning thanks to itzel. he waited almost 45 mins and then came home with a haircut i'm positive our cat could have done better. uneven and patches of hair everywhere. ridiculous.
"i just got my haircut here today and the lady who cut my hair did a fabulous job!  this was my second visit and both times i have left happy.  i will say though that this location does not follow the great clips standards... while i was disappointed about that it won't stop me from going back.  the end result is what really matters and i got a great haircut.  and in case if you're wondering how i know they are not following the standards i use to manage great clips salons for 7 years before i decided to leave the hair industry.  yes i still have a current license,  but it's only for friends and family now."
"inconsistent cuts most the time. i sat there for at least 30 minutes getting a very basic haircut (clipper cut /fade). the worker kept going over the same area with the clippers and i was starting to get a headache and somewhat irritated. the youthful looking staff members are unprofessional (well at least one is, consistently, every time i go there.) the manager and some of the older staff members a never/rarely mess up my hair. i didn't complain because i just wanted to get out and go home (after a pretty tiring day at work, this was the least of my expectations).judging by the lack of responses to negative posts on yelp, this reflects the quality of their business. i've gone here on and off for many years.... they have such a high turn over when it comes to keeping barbers. going to kim hair and nail, for 7 bucks is a way better deal than what they charge here, but i got lazy and went here.my hair style is pretty damn simple.... if anyone reading this can do a regular buzz cut/ clipper fade let me know! lol"
"(fyi - i posted this same review about the evergreen square site, since i visit both of them,, depending on which has the shorter wait time.)what's in a haircut?i never thought much about it until my perspective changed. i had a diving accident in 2014. i'm paralyzed below my chest with no functional use of my arms or hands. so appearances above the chest are more important to me now - you gotta make use of what you have. that means goofy hair is no longer acceptable for me.sadly, it happens when my hair gets too long on the side of my head, because that's where the controls for my wheelchair lie. so i like my hair a bit shorter on the side of my head. i tell the hairstylist what i want, and i get what i ask for. you're gonna like that.i like that they save my haircut online so if i go to a different location i come out looking the same. make sure to use the online check-in to save time! you're gonna like that too.for any wheelchair users, the sites at evergreen square and tully road are approved by me - i have a huge electric chair. the ladies are happy to move their barber seats out of the way and i plug right in.consistency, flexibility, wheelchair compatibility, and all the latest tech. there's a lot i like."
this location has been terrible the second time my husband went too. he asked marylou the stylist to shave his head bald but instead she left pouches of hair on his head.  a terrible job but before she shaved it he ask to wash his hair. she ask if he can transfer from his wheelchair which he said no then she said no we can't wash your hair. the first time he went they were able to wash his hair while he was in his wheelchair.  called this shop twice to complain and yet again they didn't do anything. this is the last time he comes here.
i came here last saturday morning right when they opened. i asked for a zero on the sides and a medium to high fade.i believe the person that serviced me was denise.anyways her razor cut my neck and now i have dry scabs from where the blood clotted.never coming back here again.
friendly staff... came in for a trim and the styles was very kind and fast... they keep your hair cut records.. which kinda caught me off guard lol... but seems in handy for next time..
"if yelp had a minus star ratings, this place earned it. they  cut my hair unevenly, so when i went back to bring this to their attention, i waited to  speak to the girl that cut my hair, then all of a sudden two other hair trimmers weighed in on their ideas;  they wanted to cut even more off, but that would have left me bald; then said do i comb over my hair? their next remedy was to let it grow out! then one trimmer said, ""i was being a"", and then spoke under her breath. that was not exactly how i thought they would handle the issue. so they said leave my number and we will call you back, i was upset with having to argue with employees who have no protocol to deal with issues with their customers. the employees have varying abilities cutting hair and you have to be careful who you get. customer service is terrible. there friendly until you have an problem. then the aprons come off. until they get there employees on the same page, i would go elsewhere.3/18/17 changed my review. their a-ok.p.s. the next mourning i received a message from the owner and a call from the manager, and they pretty much bent over backwards to make it right, which made me feel like doing cartwheels! thank you!"
first timer at great clips. needed my hair trimmed. issy cut &styled my hair as good as i've ever had. no reason to pay$$$ ever again. i highly recommend issy as ur new stylist
"i don't usually go out to get my hair cut, but i was in need of a trim and had a coupon for $2 off at great clips, so i thought i might as well give it a try. upon arrival i was greeted by the employees and immediately seated. my hair stylist, nancy, was extremely friendly and went right to it. i didn't need much but about an inch and a half off around, as well as an inch off my bangs. nancy was also very good about starting off subtly to make sure not too much was cut off; she made sure to cut off all the frayed ends while keeping my hair at a good length to continue growing out.the session was short, but nancy was such a friendly and accommodating individual that i'm definitely willing to come back for all my hair cutting needs!"
on saturdays it's not so bad but i made the mistake of coming on a friday night at 7:30. not busy but there's two stylist just cleaning up while the other is with a client. no checking in on me or letting me know why they haven't tended to me. probably never coming back. the people on saturdays are a lot more courteous so i recommend coming going that day.
"this is the worst place you can go to get a hair cut, hands down. my hair was butchered here. asked for a fade halfway up, the lady even pointed out how high she was going to go and continued to go way to high, and didn't even blend the sides."
i spontaneously went in today to get my hair trimmed and i am more than satisfied with their services. katelyn was super friendly! she did exactly what i asked for when she cut my hairs and she did a wonderful job! my hair feels amazingly soft and healthy. definitely will be coming back here.
"walked in and had a simple wash, style and blow dry done to my hair. nancy was wonderful. did a good job, gave me advice, refered me to a place in willow glenn that specialized in hair loss, did a great job on my hair looking at every detail. i will definitely return in the future."
was looking for a trim and some more layers added. let's just said they need to get some more education...
"i was a little hesitant to come here, but i needed a quick trim since i'm pressed for time. the first time i came here was when they first opened. i had a guy and while the cut was nice he butchered my bangs. they were supposed to be side bangs however he cut them as straight short bangs just pushed to the side. i had to have my uncle fix it once we got home, which is why i was very hesitant about coming here again.i got denise as my hair stylist. she was amazing! she gave me some information about the quality of my hair and how i can make it healthier. she was also very relaxed and humored by my lack of hair knowledge. she didn't get impatient by me not being able to decide. rather she helped me make a decision. overall, denise has changed my opinion about this place. i loved her and i would love getting my hair cut by here whenever i'm up north."
"this is my go-to salon.  super new and fresh. i consistently get a great haircut and have a good time, too.  staff here is nice and the facility is very clean.  added bonus is i can reward myself with ice cream, panda, or in n out after my cut.i i've never had a bad cut here, they seem to be staffed well, are clean, and they have people who actually can speak english.  recommend that you give them a try and see for yourself."
omg you'd think that after cutting soooo many people's hair they'd be able to at least give a decent fade... they can't. they ruined my brothers and sons hair at the same time. after they asked for so much info name. address. age. surprised they didn't ask for a social security number. don't do it people. it's not worth the few weeks of having a horrible haircut. for $16!!!
"haven't had madison's hair trimmed in awhile. it took a lot of coaxing but i finally got her in here.... first things first, very clean location. has a very new feel to it still. the lady that trimmed her hair made maddie feel extremely comfortable."
"i have very long hair and went in for a quick trim as i had not been able to get into the salon. they were helpful, fast and did a good job for basic trim, especially for 18 bucks. the lady also tapered my face layers and feathered the bottom so it was not a super harsh cut, she did great. would go back."
"i can't give feedback on their hair cutting because we did not even get that far. the woman at the front (also a stylist) was so dismissive and rude when we entered my 9 year old daughter (who needed the haircut) was appalled at how she treated us. after waiting 20 mim for her to finish and my daughter hopped in the chair and this woman began telling us how bad her hair was and that the cut we wanted would look terrible on her. my daughter was again shocked and we ended up leaving without a haircut because it was so rude, abrasive and offputting. i have never felt like i was unwelcome in a business before. we did end up across the street at another salon where none of that wad an issue and my daughter got exactly the haircut we wanted and it looked fabulous"
"very long overdue review.  i've been coming here for almost 20 years, since they first opened.  for the most part, the staff has stayed fairly constant for years, so there is a lot of experience cutting hair here.  i always see caroline who is consistent and tremendous at her job.  she has a lot of long term clients.even though i've moved further away, i still make the time to come back and see her.the store itself is clean and well organized.    various products in store to buy also.they have an online app system so you can check in before you get there, which is very convenient.  those complaining about walk ins going first must be confused about this.  prices have gone up over the years, but so have everything else, so people need to get over that.this isn't a high end salon, but if you are looking for a quality cut without the frills or hassle, go here, you'll be happy."
"worst great clips in the bay area. great franchise with many talented people that work at other locations (foster city) but this place is horrible. rude, tired, and incapable manager of doing her job. i wanted a shorter haircut in which the manager said she can't because she was going to cut her hands. i don't recommend you go here; please do a little more research and find an alternative. i am the type to get a haircut every two weeks and i expect a good haircut; if you consider yourself someone like me....don't go here."
"what a horrible experience!this place spends no time or effort spent on doing a good job ... just use electric clippers all over your scalp and finish up in a couple of min, and for that they charge $18! what a rip off and a terrible feeling about having your hair ruined! no point taking to the staff as they don't seem to be aware of what a good hair cut is!"
very clean they took us right in on a saturday it's close to restaurants grocery store kind of a on stop shop they were professional and fast i don't know what else you can ask for
"looks great, but skill set to cut kids hair is missing. spoiled my 5 year old by cutting his hair in irregular line. i pointed to the stylist and she insisted what she did was right :(it will grow back, so not worried much. poor kid doesn't know any better :)"
fast and can't beat the cost. i often am in here for my kiddo and we always have him see twee. she does a great job and the price is incredibly affordable.
"drop in for my fiancé who just needed his hair buzzed off (he rocks the bald look). he barely has any hair, just the captain picard ring. price $17 is too high for this service. glad they took us in quickly though. not a very good job with shaving him for the price either - we get a cheaper, better quality cut at luxury cut hair & nail further up saratoga in the lion market. we won't go to great clips again but we were strapped for time this time, as we were trying to catch a movie and hoped that gc could match for quality at worst. oh well."
"absolute worst place to go for a haircut. there is no style when you get a haircut. they just cut your hair off, which is something you can do at home with a razor. if i could find something below one star i would have given this place a -5 star.never go here unless you are desperate to waste your money."
"i took my kid for a haircut. there is this old lady who is impatient to listen. when the haircut was not done well, i asked her to make few adjustments, she is so rude and was hurting my kid intentionally with the hair clipper. i had to warn her to be careful with the clipper. i would stay away from this location."
"can i give a no star rating? they are completely clueless here.  i dropped in, just like everyone else.  i wanted to get a haircut for my 83 year old mother. i asked them how long the wait would be and they told me 15 minutes.  i told them i was going to get gas and that i would be back in 15 minutes.  i asked them if they needed my name and they said no. i went to get gas and came back before 15 minutes.  i brought my mother in and waited another 15 minutes for one of them to finish with their clients.  they both finished around the same time then took other walk-in clients!  when i approach her about it, she just looked at me like she saw a ghost.  she mumbled something about not having an appointment.  i said i made an appointment a half hour ago!  they should have told me i had to stay there, otherwise i would be giving up my appointment.  i don't know how good they are at cutting hair, but their customer service stinks."
"this place is good.  i used to be a regular here when i lived a lot closer to the area.  i really enjoy how great clips keep your hair cut information in the system, so then you don't have to mention to the employees what type of cut you want.  seems like this place is great for people of all ages.  the reason for just 3 stars is the price.  it'll cost you 15 to 16 dollars for a men's haircut.  now some folks might think that's already pretty reasonable, but i guess since my hair is pretty easy to cut, for me i usually go to places that will charge 10 to 12 dollars and still maintain a quality cut.  regarding price again, this place does accept competitor coupons, so make sure to check online or in the mail to see if you could find a coupon before coming here.  the ladies there do a great job so its worth checking out next time you want a hair cut."
"awful... i guess they don't care about their reviews because nothing's changed since the first time we went. my son has fairly easy hair to cut & they never get it like he wants it. language barriers also prevent any meaningful communication. it's a hair cutting mill, only there to burn through as many people in a day as possible. sports clips from now on. maybe they'll put this horrible place out of business."
"i love great clips, because they store your information, then access it before each cut. they know generally what i want in terms of clip length, then focus down on the details before cutting.they also have great products they recommend, which might seem like a sales pitch to some but a blessing to others. through this store i found nioxin, which thickens hair. the shampoo is quite expensive (i got redken instead, which is not as good but you get a much bigger bottle), but the nioxin hair gel is affordable and really does help.there is one lady who cuts my hair extremely well and gives a great head massage when you get shampooed. i don't want to give out her name or the days she works because i don't want to bombard her with requests, but if you send me a message i'll tell you. i don't know her full capabilities, but she does an asian fade very well."
this is second time i went... first time i went they did satisfactory...but this time when i went some guy did my hair cut within 5 mnt and totally screwed it. so my conclusion is that its very unstable and hair is on your risk since every time different person will cut..... now i have to wait to 1 month to get it rectify..i would not suggest any more thats all...... if you really interested great clips try sunnyvale great clips.. some how they did better job.... but this and santa clara great clips have horrible experience.
below par even for soulless hair salon chains.  been there a few times and had in indifferent to rude service every time. not going there again.
"i've been going here for years and i always go to thuy because she is familiar with my weirdo noggin and how to cut my hair so it actually looks good!everyone there is pretty friendly, the prices aren't bad (i will never pay $40 for a men's hair cut) and i rarely have to wait more than 10-15 minutes."
this place gives a great hair cut but won't extend wifi access while you wait. it would be a great idea if they would consider this for their busy customers.
i have a frequent customer card  that i wanted to redeem. they said that my hair cut voucher was not valid to use because it was styled cut and not a regular haircut .  the voucher did not have any restrictions or limitation.  i had paid for 12 haircuts to get the 1 free hair voucher and was told to pay for the $9 difference .  it seems like a  questionable promotion. i had planned on tipping  $5 but changed my mind and only tipped $3 .
"i've been going here for about 2 years just about and every time i go i am greeting with warm smiles and feel at home.anh seems to be the lucky gal that gets me the most. she is so sweet and loves to chit chat which makes getting my haircut more enjoyable. i have had several people cut my hair there, and i do not have any complaints!!! you all are wonderful!!!"
this place selectively honors app check-ins. today it was a 0 minute wait yet i waited 20 minutes before another guy who didn't check in was taken before me. and then a guy who did check in was taken in front of me. i deleted the app never to return
this place seriously chomped my hair. came by because the place i usually go to was closed...should have just waited a few days. all i wanted was a 1 on the sides and a small trim. what i got was a jacked up hairline and stray hairs everywhere. just stay away.
terrible. i went today for the first time in a while and i paid $28 for a hair & beard cut - the lady couldn't even line up my beard. seriously?! 28 dollars. i do not recommend.
"well i asked for below the earsee pic...there was no wait which was a plus... and my daughter enjoyed her hair cut and her little lollipop. the lady did great with herthe gentleman i had... i should have realized before i looked it was going to be bad as i could hear him mumbling... not even, still not even.... crap"
"worst hack job ever!do not let ky touch your hair unless you want it butchered. not sure if she has ever cut hair before or under the influence of substances, but she was horrible! never going back here. ever."
fast and easy way to get a quick trim. the online appointment lets you miss the crowds.
"avoid thu.told him low fade, he didn't see he was using a zero and faded high instead.turned the low fade to a high fade and cut all these different angles into my head!hell no!"
"best place for a kid's hair cut!i walked in with my 2 yr old toddler, who badly needed a hair cut. i was dreading the moment till lyndsay greeted us with a smile and made us feel she is in charge of the situation and it will be just a cake walk. sure it was! compared to the earlier experiences, my son was super cool, cried less while lyndsay did her magic with her clipper on my son's hair. she was super quick and knew exactly what to do. the hair cut was done in minutes! she is very good with kids. so if you have to get your toddler's hair cut, ask for lyndsay. plus there was no wait, so it was a huge plus for me!!"
"oh boy... so i got some coupons in the mail and since i wanted an easy yet specific cut, i thought i would try this place out, it helps that they are close to my house. i was greeted by the owner (maybe, he was in charge) and was told 15 minutes. it's was about that so, so far so good. i met kim who told me this was her first day there but that she worked at another salon previously. it all went downhill from here. i told her that i wanted her to take the longest attachment for the clippers that she had, and make all my hair one length. easy yet specific. no thinning shears, leave the sideburns alone, and clean up the neck. part way through, she starts to change the attachment. i stopped her and said all one length. then she takes out the thinning shears, so i tell her no and ask her not to use them. she starts talking about blending and fading and again i say, all one length. so she starts halfassing the rest of the cut and then says she's done. i pay with no tip, because you shouldn't ever have to tell someone cutting your hair the same thing that many times. when i get outside and look closely i see that the sides aren't even the same length, never mind the top being the same as the sides. so i go back in and tell the owner/ manager that it needs to be fixed. at least he did what i requested. since hair can't be added back, all my hair is now about 1/4 of an inch long.they were so bad they are no longer in business."
"no stars if possiblei've had a bad haircut in the past. but i've never been anywhere that allowed someone with no experience cutting hair to attempt on the job training with one of their best customers. i've been going to the location above for some time. and before that, went to the location in downtown san jose. i drive several miles to the above store because they have done a good job in the past. but this last experience was very disrespectful to me. the store manager allison has apparently hired a family member or friend (which is admirable); but with zero experience actually cutting hair. i've wasted my time and gas for someone to try and learn to cut hair on a paying customer. i now have to waste more time and gas to get a capable person to fix the screw up caused by your franchise manager's poor judgement! this obviously won't affect your bottom line as these are franchises. but i will not be returning to any great clips. bad reviews hurt all of your stores. and a great clips sign on the door is what the potential customer sees. very very bad experience for what should have been a simple hair cut. 10 minutes tops for the total job. and i always give a good tip. again; very disrespectful for a long time customer!"
extremely impolite. very bad customer service. checked in online - wait time kept going up from 15 min to 32min although i was there waiting!!! not worth it - take your business somewhere else.
"just had the worst haircut ever by stephanie carter! she did not take a single care when cutting my hair my lines in the back are all crooked, she didn't trim my neck, there was a line all the way around my head where she tried to do a fade, and she did not even comb my hair when she was done. i should get my hair fixed and all my money back. be careful."
"2 is generous, but i require a special cut., my wife is still satisfied with them so i can at least give them 2 stars.  after being turned away from 3 salons for a flat top due to skill and complexity requirements, the place who agreed and assured me they know what they were doing was great clips.   usually i reserve the flat top from the barber in mountain view. . ..  far, far to complex a cut for generic salon folk.  i knew in my gut i was making a mistake, but was i trapped with no barber open for a quick fix,i had recently grown my hair out from a 0 shave and was ready for the first flat top in 6 months. perhaps my standards were too high after getting the ""oh so darn flat"" cut from my barber.   the flat top that made people stop and say ""wow thats the flatest i have ever seen ever""what i received from great clips was just right of gumby's hair style.  great slant to one side and really fuzzy on the left6 if you like that kind of thing.   i was regalled with the story of how she watched a lad cut a flat top and did 3 others on kids making her expert.  all of course after the damage was done. fortunately hair grows back, and it was only 15 bucks plus tip.   my barber charges  $9 which i gladly drop $20 for his expertise.lesson: there is a reason barbers still exisit.  plan accordingly or suffer the wrath of the cheap salon.  good news is if i ever need a gumby left cut, they have it in there computer for future reference."
"i have now been to this location twice. both times i had to sit and argue with them about how i wanted my haircut. even though i have had the same cut many times before from different places, they wanted to convince me that the cut would not work. while i do realize this is their job, i'm pretty sure i have lived with my same hair for over 25 years and know better than anyone what it will and will not do. they need to listen to their customers wants rather than telling them what they need. i will not make the same mistake again and will be looking for a professional barber at this point."
"this review  for my son hair cut. even though his hair type is easy to cut and we asked very simple hair style, he could not do it properly. i think great clips quality is declining these days and i don't know why!"
"mina the hair stylist did a good job with the haircut.however, i do not like this franchise location. they  charge the highest for hair cuts $16. they do not honor the great clip $11.99 hair cut promotion. you buy $11.99 hair cuts in advance and load them onto the gift card. i bought 5 from this location 6 months ago. the cashier refused to even look on his cashier/computer to see if they could do this.  would never come to again because of poor customer service."
"i've been meaning to write a review but haven't had the time. anyway, my story happened a couple months ago when i came in for a haircut. i asked for the asian guy david.  he seemed like a cool guy who cut hair well. but truthfulness was the real problem. as i was paying to leave, i gave david a 20 dollar bill for my 16 dollar cut. not realizing how much change he gave me back, i proceeded to walk out. i was in my car and finally realized david had stole 3 dollars from me because he only gave me a dollar back in change. maybe he thought i wasn't going to tip him? but still, you don't fucking do that kind of stuff. i was about to walk in and call him out, yet there were kids inside so i didnt want to make a huge scene. long story short, i payed, and he didn't give me my full amount of change back because he was trying to sneak a little extra for himself."
"they served someone who walked in after me first. while she was shampooing my hair, she wasn't paying attention and was basically shampooing my eyebrows. after shampooing my hair into knots, she proceeded to rip them out with a comb. after telling her what style cut i wanted, she began to cut my hair and then informed that that was not the right style for me. she spent the entire time telling me everything wrong with my hairstyle and color. she even told me that i had to cut my hair like hers to look good. i will not be going back here. i would not recommend this place."
"absolutely the worst hair cut ive ever had! if u go there make sure one of the asian ladies cut your hair! im white and not racist but the last two times i was there an older white lady then today a young white lady messed up doing a 1 to 3 fade! lol every time one of the asian ladies cut my hair it came out right! absolute waste of money! i truly told her theres nothing else she could do for me, paid my bill and booked it before she messed it up more than she already did!"
quick visit no waiting and reasonable priced hair cut with sylvia ! thanks will be back !
"amateur stylists, can't do a good job on both kids and adults, ruined mine and daughters hair style. stay away!"
"i dislike giving negative reviews but this had to be said. had my boyfriend take our son here for a hair cut. it was his second time with rasario, first time was a decent cut although at that time she refused to fix uneven areas that i pointed out stating ""it's just like that"". my son didn't want to get back into the chair anyways because she kept squeezing my son's cheeks together while cutting his hair. i was already irritated with her so i stated my frustration and let it go.  second time, my boyfriend thought he'd give it another shot, hoped to get another stylist but got rasario again. she managed to carve one large bald spots in the back of my son's head & a crooked fade on both sides. mind you, my son stays still for his hair cuts. my boyfriend said he asked her to fix it but she refused again & so he left with son thinking it probably wasn't a good idea to have her ""fix"" the mistakes because my son would probably end up bald. the minute i got home and saw my son, i could see the unevenness, where she did not actually fade instead just cut straight through with no blending. it looked horrible. i was so upset. i called and the guy who answered was nice enough to say sorry and that they'd fix it. horrible customer service from rosario, even more horrible hair cut. thankfully the younger asian lady fixed rosario's mistakes but still, why did this even happen in the first place? ugh. so frustrating."
"been here four times. first few visits went well. the stylist was able to get the work done really fast with acceptable quality.the last visit today was horrible. the stylist was not adequately trained,  probably only a trainee, reckless and impatient. she keeps waving the knives and scissors in front of my eyes within a close distance and got my neck hurt when trimming. when finished i asked for a mirror to see the back side, she quickly realized the work was not properly done and continue refining it. definitely not worth $18. better spend a few more to find a better place."
"usually i come here right after i go to the gym about once every two weeks.  every time you go there's different people every time and its hard to get a consistent person.  i don't really mind as long as they know what they are doing and my hair looks decent enough.  however, today was so bad that i feel the convenience of this shop no longer worth it.  usually my hair is longer and if they mess up a little bit i can style it in a way to look ok.  but todays cut was so bad that there was no possible product that can save it.  i literally went to my car, looked in the mirror and screamed. never been so mad about a haircut before. good luck to whoever decides to get their haircut here. its like flipping a coin"
"great price, great jobs, great service.this is the first time i come to this place for my haircut, i will come back and this is will be my favorite shop for now on , i love the way they take care my hair and shampoo,the shop looks very nice and clean, music soft and nice , very friendly and special the service is the best , 5 start definitely giving to this shop , believe me, just come try one time it can say all .1085 e brokaw road san jose ca 95131 ."
"i am usually hesitant about coming to places such as great clips solely because i've had bad experiences years ago. a few days ago, i thought i'd give it a shot because i was starting school again, and didn't have time to make an appointment at a salon. i walked in and was greeted right away, jennie led me to my seat where i told her what i wanted. i wanted only my dead ends cut, didn't want my hair to go short since i'm trying to grow it longer. and then i told her i wanted layers. okay. layers are supposed to flow evenly with your hair. that didn't happen. i also asked for my hair to be whisky around my face, but didn't allow it to flow evenly with the rest of my hair. kind of like ""here's the wisp, and just goes straight into my regular length. definitely doesn't blend well at all. jennie told me she was only cutting 1 inch for dead ends. she ended cutting about 2/3 inches:( in terms of my layers. they are really bad. never had layers like this... my layers came out more of a straight line!:( it looks really bad. i tried telling her, and she said ""no, it's supposed to look like that."" i didn't want to cause a scene, so i paid $18 and left. i recommend going to an upscale salon if you want your hair cut. she even left one strand of my long hair, which wasn't cut. she's a sweet lady, but doesn't know how to style. really upset. thankfully i made an appointment at elysian hair salon to fix what great clips messed up."
"i had a haircut here yesterday with an old asian lady. since my hair was below my waistline, i specifically asked ""to cut 6-7 inches for my hair to be at my chest-level"" and showed her exactly how long.after the cut, my hair is barely touching my shoulders... it's at least 3-4 inches shorter than what i asked for. would not recommend the old lady working here. she became extremely defensive when i told her this was much shorter than what i asked for, and she tried to blame me for misguiding her?!?it was my first time trying great clips and will be my last. never coming back here again..."
the owner offer my dad to go back again for a hair cut. he was happy with the service this time. they listen to him and make sure the length he wants before they started.
owner was extremely sincere in remedying the situation and was kind to offer a free haircut and a refund. i believe he has address the situation and is very sincere about serving the customers.
great place and great price .one of the best haircuts i ever received in the bay area ...
"clean, super fast, very friendly. i got a coupon as new resident in the hood so i wanted to take advantage of trimming my hair without spending too much. so that is a perfect approach. for less than $8 i left the salon feeling the queen of mambo! very clean, there was a guy removing the hair of customers from the floor all the time."
"been here quite a few times, recommend tc and rasario as stylists. first cut today with rasario and she did great, one of the best cuts i've had in awhile. check in online to avoid longer waits upon arriving."
"listen, if you're like me, time is important and on that champagne taste with a kombucha budget then i can't say enough about this place and this location. first off, it's so easy to schedule an appointment. i did it through yelp and they have an app. boom, you know what to expect in terms of waiting time. second, i used to see angel but she no longer is there and i came in today serendipitously and john took me. we chatted for a few minutes about what i was looking to achieve hair style wise and he worked with it.  i closed my eyes, meditated for what seemed like 10 mins and bam  a new beautiful hairstyle appeared! seriously blown away by his listening skills and artistry. he's a professional for sure. highly recommend him and this location. oh and to boot, place is clean, fun music, and clean bathroom. coming back in a few months!"
ms. vicky is a great hair stylist. she take her time with my 10 years old daughter and my hair cut. she is knowledgeable stylist here. this is the third time we came back to this place. great customer service from front desk check in. ms. linda is very nice stylist. she is gentle with my 5 yrs old.
my 9 year old gets his hair cut here almost monthly. they have great deals and always sending coupons. he only wants amar he is very patient and listens to exactly what my son wants. my son refuses to let anyone else touch his hair. he always asks my son how he is doing. my son has sensory issues so is sensitive and amar understands. i too have had my hair cut and i had an older asian man and he was great and super fast.
i got haircut by sima. it is the worst haircut i received in bay area. she does not even listen to me what i am asking for and she left all of a sudden when i am asking about some changes and complained the main guy. worst service and you dont get what you ask for. all you will get is what they cut (i still tipped 25%)don't go for haircut over here
"natalie was so sweet and gave me a great haircut! i showed her a picture because i wanted of long layers  and she gave me exactly what i wanted, thanks girl!"
"i was skeptical the first time i came here because i consider this a ""discount"" place.however, go see linda or tatiana.  both excellent stylist who always give me a great cut and both are worth waiting for.just because this is a ""discount"" type of place do not forget to tip the gals well.  they are worth every dollar!!"
walked in on a monday evening and the wait time was less than 10 minutes. the stylist was very professional and took great care in doing the hair cut.
"i had been coming here for many years, and always received an excellent cut.  areli, who has since left, always did an exceptional job.  the others who i found exceptional include evonne, anne, and timmy.  the atmosphere has always been welcoming and relaxing.  i can sometimes get busy, but i found that non-peak times, especially the morning, worked best.  of all the great clips shops i have been to throughout the bay area, this one was the best."
"it's impossible to get it cut how you want it. i've been here several times asking for a hair cut a certain way, and they always cut it how they want it, not how you want it and they don't listen to what you say when you ask them to cut it. skip this place, go to a place with people that listen to their clients."
"i usually frequent great clips for a trim in  between salon appointments. this last visit left me with short layers cut in back,  which i did not request. i told the stylist  that there was one short layer that i was trying to grow out. i was disappointed to have  choppy layes in the back of my head . please listen to your customers."
"decided to come here instead of the usual location in sunnyvale.  the experience was ok.  it looks like the sunnyvale location is not correctly connected to the great clips network.  the stylist could not find any notes from the sunnyvale location regarding how my hair is normally cut, etc.several different stylists at the sunnyvale location have done my hair and i've been happy with each and every one of them.  i was not really ""feeling"" my haircut from this spot.  so, i will just stick to the sunnyvale spot."
just had a haircut for myself and my two sons. both jenny and mary did a great job!  highly recommended!
"this guys s my third visit here. very nice people working here. always respectful, accurate and professional. iris martinez is real professional. she did a great job. it is first time she cut my hairs. i like it! definitely five stars deserved! i will come back for sure!"
my boys gets their hair cut here. they love everyone that works here. great customer service and they do not rush you even if it's the not so little ones who are getting them. it can really gets super busy on weekends so check in ahead of time on line.
very poor customer service. checked in online and it said wait is 0 mins. walked in a bit later and had to wait while they took other customers rather than by the order of online check-in.
excellent customer service and professional. araseli cut my hair and washed my hair. she knows how to cut and style your hair. thank you for my new style!!!
had a decent haircut as i asked the person to cut of size 2 for side but he didnot have proper equipment and did a haircut just by approximation. cut was ok but not what was required.
"my only issue with this place is the employees coming in late which causes a big backlog. the store opens at 9am and there is only 1-2 stylists on site. then within the next 15-30 minutes the rest of the employees waltz in late. i'm fine waiting for a haircut if you are busy, i'm not fine waiting for employees to get their coffee on the way in and showing up late. i think the classic saying needs to be enforced here. if you're 15 minutes early, you're on time, if you're on time, you're late, and if you are late, don't bother showing up. operationally, this delays you all day long. this is now the 3rd time i've dealt with this issue at this location. in the time it took me to write this you have lost the business of 6 people that don't want to wait."
"the owner reached out to me after i left my review to apologize for kim. apparently she was a temp to step in for someone who was taking time off due to health reasons. after i requested a refund, she granted that and offered a free haircut to fix my disaster. unfortunately i was only home for the holidays so i could not take her up on the offer. i still stand by my advice to remember who has given you good haircuts and request them. if you don't remember either ask the manager for a recommendation or ask for your history or who you've had previously great clips still has a 4/5 from me with 0.5 stars taken off for kim (since she's not a regular) and rounded up since i can't give half stars"
"you get what you pay for. -.-there is a strong communication barrier with most of the barbers. regardless of what you try to ask for they're just going to stick to what they know. all in all if you want a cheap cut with a short wait this could be your place, but if you really care about your haircut (or need certain specifications for work or some other reason) this is not the place to go to."
"the good:+  cheap.+  online check-in so you can beat the line.the not so good:-  i asked for a zero fade and had to have the whole fade redone because it was cut using a one.  my guess is they don't like going straight to zero because its a little riskier if not done correctly.  i didn't like that i had to call it out and have them use a real zero.-  my fade came out a little uneven on one side, and you could see the definite transition lines looking at my fade from a side angle which was unsightly.  some of the competitors can get you a nice zero fade for about the same price.-  you need to be clear about the height of your fade and show them.  i asked for a medium to low fade, but the fade was taken almost all the way up, meaning instead of a proper tapered low fade i ended up looking like i had a faux-hawk.  bottom line:come here if you need to get trimmed up for cheap and quick.  don't expect any styling to be done, and don't expect the talent to have an emphasis on technique.  you will have to be very explicit with your directions to avoid any miscommunication."
this is the 2nd time to visit this great clips in palo alto. daniel did a very good job with my fade. he's also friendly and has such a good customer service. definitely recommend to this great clips.
signed in on line. i waited to go in until my turn was minutes away. when we walked in my app showed i was at 0 minutes. the women at the register looked at each other and informed us there were a couple of people ahead of us. it's now been almost 20 minutes and they have taken all kinds of people ahead if us. everyone that walked in when we did who had not signed in on line were told that it is a 15 minute wait. why do they bother with the app if it's the same wait? i would have come in sooner. feels like something unethical is going on here.
"incompetent and very poorly organized. i'm sitting waiting for my turn. then they had me wait while they take care of next costumer even though i had checked with them and supposed to be the next costumer. what a waste a time. what a place with incompetent staff. go there if you want a bad haircut by an incompetent staff whose main goal is to push for selling overpriced low quality shampoos.update: no that wasn't the case, i was told that i'm the next and i planned to be somewhere accordingly...  maybe your incompetent staff need a training to do more than just upselling shampoos and conditioners"
"have to sing areli's praises. i am new to the area and decided to try a cosmetology school for a bob haircut. i've had this haircut before and know how it is supposed to look and feel. unfortunately, the cosmetology school cut was a bust. the angle and overall shape of the cut was just wrong. panicking, i went to the nearest great clips in hopes that a stylist could fix the damage enough to tide me over until i could get a salon appointment. enter areli. she took me right to her chair and made sure to understand exactly what i disliked about my current cut. she took care of the shape and more. i left with the haircut that i was expecting and looking forward to. thank you, thank you, thank you!"
i've been going to this great clips for many years and they are fantastic. the staff is excellent. they handle many different styles of hair with great professionalism.
"i love evonne.  she is always so nice and does such a great job! even though it is a little far to drive, it's worth it to have her cut my hair.  she also cuts both my kids hair and they love her!"
"they do not take reservations on the phone, rather you check in online. i suppose it frees up their time to focus on cutting hair. the hair stylists here are a hit or miss. my go to hair stylist is a doll. she spends extra time with the hair style i want and you can tell she cares."
"been getting perfect hair cuts and shampoos from these folks since i was a child of nearly 5 years old , these men and women have watched me grow up. very beautiful and sweet women that work here, even at 20 minutes before closing they cut my hair perfectly. i've given them a hard time many times but they still treated me right , so close to my house to."
annoying system ....why would i give my phone number for a hair cut?????  told them so ...but they don't get it.
"what's in a haircut?i never thought much about it until my perspective changed. i had a diving accident in 2014. i'm paralyzed below my chest with no functional use of my arms or hands. so appearances above the chest are more important to me now - you gotta make use of what you have. that means goofy hair is no longer acceptable for me.sadly, it happens when my hair gets too long on the side of my head, because that's where the controls for my wheelchair lie. so i like my hair a bit shorter on the side of my head. i tell the hairstylist what i want, and i get what i ask for. you're gonna like that.i like that they save my haircut online so if i go to a different location i come out looking the same. make sure to use the online check-in to save time! you're gonna like that too.for any wheelchair users, the sites at evergreen square and tully road are approved by me - i have a huge electric chair. the ladies are happy to move their barber seats out of the way and i plug right in.consistency, flexibility, wheelchair compatibility, and all the latest tech. there's a lot i like."
"waited over a half an hour before i left. the online check-in is bs...they go before someone physically waiting. i sat through 3 people coming in and stating they had checked in online and got helped before me, then a woman who hadn't even checked in online was helped so i left... and will never be back. do not waste your time with these jerks."
i've been going here on and off for a couple of years now. the wait is short which is always a plus. its clean and comfortable. and today id like to thank lina for the cut and i will for sure be back more!
"checked in online for myself and two others. it was half an hour to closing and they looked very busy. the lady asked if we'd been there before and then asked for phone number after we were waiting for 10 minutes. she started counting money and the man said they can't take three people, nor two. they could have told us when we first got there that their online check in doesn't mean anything or better yet, not let people check in online after a certain time if they won't be served? so after reading the recent reviews, maybe it was a good thing that we didn't get service. not going back."
"hit or miss, totally depends on the stylist; no minimum guarantees.went there after a long time to try and had a very bad hair cut this morning."
"a week ago i have a 1 star rating after consecutive bad cuts. manager carmelita reached out and offered a free fix. scheduled it for a week later. a much better finish and overall experience. as previous stated there are good workers, just got to know who they are."
"got my haircut today and i actually hate it. i asked that my layers be in a v-cut. nope. didn't do that. i felt bad if i said that i hated it but i really wouldn't go here again. it turned out to be terrible. great location. terrible hair cut. i appreciate that the lady tried to keep me preoccupied by talking to me about her kids, etc. but it was just not good. i would've preferred to be cut by someone else. truly disappointed.3/6 edited. after a not-so-good haircut experience, i went back & i must say, she fixed me up really nice. my hair is thick and harder to manage but she was extremely professional and so kind even though i'm sure she may have hated my review. i explained that i shouldn't have been so negative about it however i did appreciate her sincerity and her willingness to fix the problem. would i come back? yes. definitely. thank you great clips for your dedication to excellent service!"
"i usually come here to get my hair cut, but the last time i went i had a specific way i wanted my hair cut. i even showed how much i wanted yet they gave me an ugly, short haircut that looked nothing like what i wanted. i dont have the same hair type as the cutters so i was mad that they did whatever they wanted. do not go on a day where it isnt busy because the people who are there arent good. go during a busy time so there are more people to choose from."
"1) wanted me full name, email, phone number and other personal info just to get on the list to wait for a haircut. seemed offended when i said i just wanted a haircut. 2) told me 35 minutes, i wandered around the farmers market and came back in 20 minutes, they said that i was late and they had been calling me (nothing on my phone)3) someone else had my phone number before i changed it and used great clips. the woman at the counter didn't believe that i wasn't sergio, no matter how many times i explained it. 4) haircut wasn't great. 5) there was a fly in the store, buzzing around my station, so the woman tried to use the blow dryer to blow it away. she ended up blowing a bunch of my hair from the cover in my face, twice; didn't bother apologizing."
"i have been doing to this location for 6 years but today's experience was terrible. i usually do not request specific stylist and today i was assigned to an absolute moron. he just grabbed my front hair which are thinning and cut them to the roots making me almost bald.also, another lady cut my son's hair like a someone chewed it.both new people and seemed without any experience! i have now decided to request a stylist which i know, i think it is highly important even if you have to wait.i give this place 1 star for hiring completely clueless people."
i just very much appreciate the owners tamara and her husband going out of the way to make a wrong situation right. they sent me a personal letter when i had a bad experience and gave a very good reason to their price changes recently. thank for you being understanding to me and my issue and being honest about the circumstances. much appreciate the gesture and personal care.
"it's really unfortunate when you have a business with a lack of customer service. what's worst is the business having a manager who is the prime example of inappropriate behavior and a lack of customer service. a few of the workers here speak their own language and are not courteous to how it affects the customers. to my surprised, i learned that it was the store manager ""lien"" that was bad mouthing other employees and making comments about customers (in vietnamese). please do not support a business that allows for this."
"this will be the last time i attend this place. for starters, you know it's going to be bad when you hear one of the cosmetologist complaining about when she will get to leave work and the other two workers are basically telling her to stop complaining. it gets even worse when the one that's complaining ends up cutting your hair. i don't know how she managed to pass her license exam but man was she horrible and i wish i could remember her name so i could mention it here. i always ask for the usual same as last time style which the great clips system is good at keeping track of, but she couldn't for the life of her figure out how to fade let alone make it even. she hesitated to show me the back of my head until i asked and when i saw it i was extremely disappointed. it looked like the rocky mountains jagged! had it not been so busy i would have asked for her to stop and let someone else cut my hair. like i said this will be the last $20 i pay for a bad style cut. bye bye not so great clips."
"9:04 am, saturday morning. i just called and they don't take appointments. the person said to walk in or check in on the great clips app. when i first logged into the app, the wait was 22 minutes. now 9:13 am, the wait is 13 minutes. so, if you wanted to get a hair cut at 10 am, you need to check in sometime before and hope you time your check in just right."
"checked in online where the est wait time was 35 min. was greeted immediately and finished checking in upon arrival - actual wait time was less than 15 min. lina was my assigned stylist. she asked how i wanted my hair cut and i showed her some pics of how it's normally cut by my nephew. she cut it as requested and the result was spot on. i couldn't be any happier with the cut! thank you great clips and lina for the great service - you now have a new, repeat customer!"
"i've been coming here for my haircuts since it is close by my house. i've been coming here for two years and majority of the time get my haircut from lien. i am always satisfied with the haircuts i get from her. she always listens to what i want in a haircut. it is understandable that some haircuts i show her cannot be done due to the type of hair i have, but she definitely gets close to it as possible. i would definitely recommend her."
"to be honest i've avoided coming here because for some reason i like to take chances on terrible vietnamese hair salons. since i was in the area, short on time, and in desperate need of a haircut, i decided to come in here. i was immediately greeted by a woman name karen. karen has got to be the most endearing hairstylist i've ever come across. she makes it a point to learn your name and say it at least 5 times throughout your haircut. she explains exactly what and why she's doing what she's doing. she actually reminded me to wash my hair after a haircut, i can't even be mad.as an athlete, my hair was pretty damaged due to all the chlorine and poor little pony tails it has endured! not to mention, my last haircut from some other salon left me with hair reminiscent of a 14 year old emo teeny bopper (thick on top, thin on bottom), needless to say, i hated it. karen fixed it right up erasing a weird rat tail like layer and rounding out the layers to the best of her ability. she wanted to cut a little more than what i was usually comfortable with, but she actually asked me & told me why! i like that she asked me first before she cut it because i know we all have horror stories where the stylist expressed a little too much creative freedom! long story short, my hair looks healthier and fuller without feeling heavy! glad i came in and can't wait to stop in for my next trim! :)"
"i've been going to this great clips or several years, never disappointed. the last couple cuts have been by theresa, she's fast and does a nice job. i'm not sure where the comments about rude staff come from, i've always been treated with the utmost courtesy."
"terrible. rude staff, didn't listen to my instructions.  the great clips down the street by the toys r us is great but this one is a little closer so thought i'd give it a try. big mistake, i'm a guy and not terribly picky about my hair but even i think this is awful.  tried to correct the woman doing the cut and she blew me off. to top it off she rudely demanded a tip. i laughed and left, thank god my hair grows fast."
helena looks experienced but did a really shabby job with my haircut. she finished cutting my hair within 5 minutes and was more interested in getting to the next customer. the other hairstylist took more time and seemed to have done a better job. i'd not advise this location.
this is run by a by rude people who dont know how to cut hair. please never go there with kids. they are unfriendly to kids and just dont care about customers.
"so bad! this is not my son's usual place to get his hair cut. i forced him to try this place because, 1) its great clips (pretty popular) 2) it was convenient at that very moment. after my son's hair cut, i noticed the lady didn't shave or clean the back of my son's neck to get rid of the access hair. his barber usually  does to compliment his new clean cut. i told the lady to please shave the ""baby hair"" and she sighed heavily as if i am asking her for a favor. she cleaned it but unwillingly. she charged me $17 (ridiculously expensive) i only pay $11 for his barber! i gave her a $1 - tip anyway because i'm nice like that but we are not going back unless i have the ""free haircut"" coupon which they give out sometimes at gsw games. but i will not come back to this location. i'll go to the sunnyvale location. they are more customer friendly and they pay attention to details."
"i was not happy with this place for one reason; that reason was waiting and when two of their regulars came in, they went first. i understand if they have an appointment, that can be announced, but i wasn't told. i waited for about 20 minutes and their first regular walked in, was greeted and sat right away. i thought maybe this man has an appointment, but then a second regular came in and he was sat in righty away. another man that brought his child for a haircut was also interrupted to attend the two regulars. after leaving the place, i saw a sign that says ""first come, first serve."" never coming back again."
"i had a great experience,   i went to another place to get a hair cut and they messed up my hair bad. i went here after and they did a great job fixing my hair and i actually received complements afterwards, amazing"
they are not professional and very arrogant. they should learn how to cut hair and deal with costumer
can i give a minus star? so i specifically told the girl i was growing my hair out after years of crew cuts. i just needed a little trim and cleanup in the back. i had a party to go to that night....and i went here cuz my regular place is pretty spendy even for a trim. you get what you pay for right?lets just say i walked in expecting to pay a fair price for a trim. i left with a free crew cut and a bad attitude...
"i usually spend about $90 getting my hair cut but recently i've been trying to save money where i can so i opted for a ""cheap"" haircut. i came in great clips a bit nervous, but my long hair was so fried and damaged it was time to chop it up. i told chau (i believe was his name) what i wanted and he delivered. only 15 minutes and $16 later, my hair looked great and feels so much better. it's shorter than i usually have it, but he did a great job preserving some length and adding volume with layers and he succeeded in getting rid of most of my fried ends. he couldn't get rid of all of it because then my hair would've been too short and he was very conscientious about preserving length like i wanted. definitely will be coming back here in a few months to get rid of rest of the damaged hair. thanks, great clips!"
never too busy and always fast.  their app wait estimates are actually accurate.  if you want a decent haircut fast these guys are far better than supercuts.
"been coming to this great clips for a few years now. each of the hair stylists working there have different levels of skills/repeatability/etc.  i come to get my hair cut every couple of months and it's a trouble free and quick experience.i only come here for one of the stylists, helena. she's friendly, experienced at cutting hair quickly and efficiently, and does a great job whenever i go. i did have one fairly negative experience a couple of years back when i stopped by for a hair cut when helena wasn't there and it was just horrible.  took forever and turned out pretty bad.if you come here for a hair cut, ask for helena. she does a great job and if you have a request, discuss with her to come to a common understanding of what you want done. she'll work with you. other notes:at times, it can get busy, and some of the stylists do get chatty. they don't have a dedicated person to handle the reception, so if all of the stylists are engaged with customers, it might take a few moments to get signed in. they have an app for checking in, so definitely use that if you are in a rush.while waiting for my daughter's hair to get cut, i've watched other children get their hair cut and there's definitely a lot of satisfied parent/child customers here.i've seen some customers come in asking for a hair treatment, were told politely that they didn't do that particular service on that day, and the customer leaves complaining bitterly about them not being professional. don't understand this, but if you ask for a service and are told it isn't available, then it isn't . arguing or complaining loudly just makes that person a bad customer, in my mind. :(anyways, i like coming here since i get my hair cut at a good price and it comes out the same way each time. happy customer.edit:i don't speak vietnamese, only english, and i get great customer service here."
great staff and boy do they know how to cut hair! from kids to adults they have it totally dialed in!wait was short and the place was clean and staff was informative and attentive! be back for sure as the quality of cut was just awesome.great location as well!
"this is place consistently cuts my hair and they do it well. i regularly go here with my my kids and they are good with children. you can even use the app and schedule an appointment ahead of time, but i never do. they are open late so that helps me fit a haircut in with my busy schedule."
"terrible service. at one point i had to come twice so that they fix the haircut, even then it wasn't fixed properly. the manager has zero customer service skills. even if you check in with the app, and arrive 10 mins before they close, they will start complaining, and say come tomorrow. even though the app clearly states that you just need to arrive before closing. this great clips has the worst customer service out of all great clips i've visited in multiple states."
"i have tried many hair cuts places in the same price range as this great clips on kiely road and el camino real. i can say with confidence this is the worst place i've been to.i tried this place twice, the 2nd time i was really hoping the first time's bad experience was just an isolated incidence. hey, every one (place) deserves a second chance, right?  boy, was i wrong for giving this place the benefit of the doubt. the second time, i had a different hair dresser. at the end of her short session, i found that my hair is significantly shorter on one side than the other. in addition, it is shapeless and ticking out like cactus' arms. i felt ashamed even walking outside.i nicely asked the hair dresser if she could fix it a bit and nicely pointed out the issues with the mirror. she told me that if i want to fix it, that is the price of having a second hair cut done. so she flatly refused to fix anything.i know hair styles can be subjective sometimes, and i was definitely not expecting anything fancy from a budget place like this. but to brutalize someone's hair like this, and refusing to fix it is really unprofessional. if you don't mind getting an uneven hair cut, and just want to be in and out like a sausage factory, then maybe you can afford to take the risk at this place for $15. but if you want to look half way presentable at work, avoid this place like a plague."
"i was in a hurry and on this end of town, so i ducked in. my haircut is simple enough that i wasn't concerned about it getting screwed up, really. it's that basic.they took me right in, the lady who cut my hair (40s, vietnamese, pleasant) was conversational without talking me ear off.efficient, inexpensive, and sweet. my basic haircut looked fine, and i was back on the road running my errands 15 minutes later. who could ask for anything more from a quickie haircut place?"
"frauds? 9.99 sale they say you can only get 5 max.. while great clips nationwide say you can get between 5-25 per person..these people are only looking to make money.,., wont even listen without interrupting.. u have t explain/talk to them like kids..their 9.99 fraud personal store policy pi$$ed me off.."
"this is my go-to place for haircuts. i'm a pretty shy guy, but all the hair cutters here are very nice, and allow me to try out my awkward social chit chat skills. i usually go here with my girlfriend and flirt with the hairdressers to make her jealous. she never gets jealous. for a long time i didn't know how to style my hair and it looked awful. then i went to this great clips after not having gone for 5 years or so. they had stored my haircut instructions from 5 years prior in their computer. using those ancient instructions to cut my hair gave me my identity back. thank you great clips. i am forever in your debt."
"i came here to get my son a haircut. i don't know if it was the language barrier, as the hair stylist demonstrated a very thick accent in her expression and didn't paraphrase what i requested, but i did not end with what i asked for. i specifically ask for my son's hair to be ""trimmed, very slightly, as he's trying to let the top hair grow for a style."" i went to sit down and read a magazine and 10 minutes later i am called to see my son with his hair trimmed down to a ""spike-with-gel"" style, and there go two months of styling and letting his hair grow. i tipped the hairstylist and i have compassion on the person. we all need jobs, but she should try harder to understand what is being asked for in english, and deliver on it. definitely never coming back to this place. advice for future users: make sure the stylist understands what you asked for. ask them to paraphrase."
"hami and genie are the best! they both pay excellent attention to detail and can give you any haircut you want. keep in mind great clips is a fast paced salon, but hami and genie will still give you a fabulous haircut and in a short amount of time! i definitely recommend checking in online to save yourself a spot in line because it is a very busy location. and most importantly... don't forget to tip!"
"very unprofessionalwhen i checked in online, it showed 0 min wait. when i reached the salon, there was only one person working and she was already busy. after 15 min wait, another person appeared from the back room to finally take me in.she was very unfriendly and did a terrible job with my haircut. my sideburns are of unequal length and not trimmed properly.i waned to check my hair properly before leaving but she pretty much hurried me out of the chair."
calling them rude and disrespectful wouldn't do justice to how the do things here. not sure if it was just the one lady at the desk or they are all like that.
"place continues to go downhill. the stylist took barely a few minutes to finish my hair cut, and kept on trying to force me to leave my chair, make her payment and be done with it, even when it was clear that i was unhappy with the cut."
people are so polite and professional. also they are fast and listen to what you will say. i will recomend guys to come here and get their haircuts.
"their online check-in is bogus. i checked-in online and my wait period was 40 mins at the time of check-in. i waited for 40 mins and then reached the saloon. but i was still made to wait for another 25 mins despite being already checked in. not a great start if you want to retain customers, great clips."
"check in means nothing. when i first checked in, it says estimated time is 28 mins. got there before that and my time was then estimated to 47 minutes. checked in at 4:20...it is now 5:22, about to call our name...over an hour later!"
"waste of time to go there. couple of times faced this issue. i checked in online, but when i reach there before my appointment time, they asked me to wait for 30-45 minutes. i asked online system was showing 5 minutes wait time. the response was online system does not give accurate wait times, it just reserves spot. this place staff people do not value your time, so please avoid at least this place."
it is good that they are open till 8 pm on sunday but they do not answer their phone at all and voicemail is full! also the barber is eating while doing the haircut which is very disturbing.
"phoung as always does a great job. i will come to him again. he is sincere, and great at his job and goes out of the way to understand what kind of haircut you need."
"checked in on-line on a busy saturday, arrived and got in front of the line. had a nice trim with mary. i love the on-line check in and recommend doing so, especially on a weekend. got in and out."
"came in for a taper. the asian lady cutting my hair didn't know what a taper is. i trimmed my beard at home and asked her to match my sideburn to my beard, and she could not blend them together. she did a terrible job. if you're a man looking for a fade, taper, line up, or beard to hair blend don't come here. they'll mess up your hair and leave you looking messed up for the next two weeks lol"
person used past haircut notes and did not see that my visit this time was very early. relying on systems is good but then they need to learn how to use it instead of just looking at previous visit. common sense missing as they took off almost all hair on head and funny looking 'hard to define' haircut. regret going there
"*** stay away from the stylist named marianne! ***i've been to this particular great clips a whole lot and it's been a generally positive experience. i now know that was only because i had gotten lucky with my stylists (phuong is my favorite -- knowledgeable and willing to work with you every time. the lady who moved here from seattle and just had a baby is fantastic too as is the man who is into gaming. all three of you make this gc great)today, however, i was not so lucky. i ended up with a mid-age lady named marianne. off the bat, she said she didn't know how to do a fade when she looked at the instructions the stylist put in last time. i looked at her flabbergasted for a moment, to which she responds ""i guess i can blend a 2 on the sides into whatever you do on the top. trust me i can do a few things to make it look exactly the same."" (spoiler - it doesn't look exactly the same as the high fade i requested...). unfortunately there were no other stylists available so i had to just go with it. finally, before beginning, she asks me what i want to do on the top. i say that i'd like to style it and asked her if she had any recommendations. she responds with ""let me just take half an inch off the top and then we can talk about it then""she finishes doing both of the above and cleans up the edges all around, then hands me a mirror and says ""how does the back look?"". looks fine to me. ""yeah, the back looks good, but --"" she cuts me off by taking off the cover and asking to meet her at the register. let's recap:i asked for: 1) high fade, 2) style recommendation on topinstead i got: 1) a 2 on the sides/back 2) a 0.5"" trim on top.at this point she's already trying to ring me up at the register. i'm wholly confused at what the heck just happened and ask her ""wait what about the style recommendation on top?"" and she claims she won't do anything because she thinks i don't need to, to which i reply ""... but i had asked for it..."". she gives me a scowl and said to come to talk to her about it at the register. so in my shock i foolishly get up and walk to the register. as i go up i also tell her about an area where my hair tends to grow fastest in an odd direction and i ask her to cut it for me. no luck since the cover is already off, i get just an ask for a payment option...and that's when she looks at the man sitting behind me that had just walked in as she finished my haircut and says ""sir, i'm so sorry. i'll be with you in just a moment!"" her shift in attitude towards me as soon as he walked in left me so confused. i wish i had said something then, but i instead just paid. there was nothing i could do here except be angry. for the first time in my life did not leave a tip.i so badly want to come back because every other stylist has been nothing but amazing. marianne, however, is making me question my perception of great clips."
"i came here to get a standard men's haircut, 7 top 5 sides. any self respecting barber shop should be able to do that without any issue. by the time my haircut was done i already noticed some issues, but they were acceptable. at this point i would've given the cut a 3/5. then i got home and had the opportunity to take a closer look. the neck cut wasn't straight at all, and the angle of the tapers at the back were unequal. avoid this place at all costs."
"i got my hair cut with a very kind korean lady by the name of ""sonnie""the wait was prompt. even without her blow-drying my hair, i absolutely loved how she styled my hair. when i came home and blow-dried myself, i loved my hair even more! i almost regret not tipping her enough. highly recommended. definitely going back!"
"i have difficulties making stylists understand that i don't want short hair on the side. seems that most of them know one thing, and they stick with that.not the case, here - finally i got the right cut at this gc from nikki.very nice service, friendly, fast and efficient.will return."
"both of my sons prefer this place. they do excellent work, plus there's an online mobile check-in app that tells us wait time. marianne is one of the stylists there that really knows what she's doing. but i also suspect everyone there is very experienced."
"note that this is not a $40++ salon and thus please expect a different kind of service than your usual salon. this salon is good if you want to have a quick trim and not a new stylish hairstyle. if you want a new hairstyle, i suggest you go to a more expensive salon. this is a no fuss hair salon. i was in and out under 20 minutes i think.i tried this today the first time and i think this is one of the best hair salon of its kind. i got a quick trim of blunt cut. i usually don't have time to spare to pay a lot of attention to my hair, so i decided to get a no fuss hairstyle insteadwhen i came in, there was no queue, so i got called immediately. the older lady at the desk is friendly and is quick to serve me. i got my hair cut my a girl named chelsea. she is really friendly and talked to me the entire time. she even gave me advice on my hair. it was quick trim under 10 minutes. i think the haircut quality is decent enough.i used the $9.99 coupon here, and tip her separately. overall, i'm very satisfied with my trip here. would come back for a quick trim!"
"be wary of their kids prices. twice this week, i had the hair cutters charge adult prices for both my kids.  earlier this week, 2 ladies argued that my daughter looked 12 and tried to charge me adult prices, and today my 5 year old son was slipped the adult charge as well. both were cleared up when i called attention to it, but it's not an accident if it happened twice this week from different hair cutter."
"daniel is the best! the quality of his work is by far the best i've ever experienced at any great clips location. he is passionate about his work and can recommend different styles based on what you like. he is patient and makes an effort to get to know you as a person. i have been coming back to this location for about 4 months now, and will continue to do so!"
"daniel is the best! i've been coming here for years and have mostly had average hair cuts and would occasionally try other places looking for the right person. then that all changed when daniel came along. under new management, this place is remarkably better than it ever was or any of the other local places i tried. daniel knows exactly what i want and how to make it look good even without me telling him. there's no one else i would go to here but i could not be happier."
"always professional, very clean and there are many stylists that have been there a long time which is nice.  using the online check in application is super helpful to let you know the current wait time."
"got a great haircut from daniel! super nice, super professional and super efficient! my wife loved the haircut, so thank you to daniel for that! #happywifehappylife"
"love this place! i first came here by accident and met daniel, now i keep coming back ever since! daniel helps me with style and suggestions about how to do/take care of my hair. his service was great and beyond. he seem passionate about haircut and very professional, he listened what i need and delivered exact the way i want. i would definitely recommend daniel and great clips here!"
"these guys can't figure out who is who, confusing everyone in the lobby. the customers have to tell the staff who's next. several people walked out pissed."
"i normally don't get my hair cut at great clips but after a wonderful review from my mom (who loved her hair cut by daniel!), i had to give it a shot! daniel was very professional and friendly, and my husband wouldn't stop giving me compliments on it!"
management does not know how to use the reservation system. told us that one employee called in sick. their reservation system is based on the number of employees there. and he said they had a walk in but it pushed everyone with a reservation our by 30 minuted. why have a reservation system if you don't know how to use it.
great service from stylist anna. we did a complete shave for my two year old son. she was so good with the baby and did a awesome job.
"this place was busy when i first walked in but i was helped immediately. i came with a haircut in mind and showed daniel  a picture. with some suggestions from him, daniel cut my hair to perfection. he definitely knows what is current and what he is doing. i am one happy customer when i walked out. i would surely recommend him and i can't wait for my next haircut."
"i used to drive half an hour to a salon for hair cuts, but about six months ago i found myself desperate for a cut and my salon was booked a month out. my husband and son had been going here for a while, so i figured i'd give it a try. this place is literally the best timesaver ever. you can drop in when it's convenient, sign in on your phone so you don't have to wait, and be in and out in twenty minutes. the women are lovely, and after multiple great haircuts i can't imagine going the salon route again. this last time i had a coupon for an $8 haircut. i tipped $5 on my $8 haircut because i felt like i was stealing.extra bonus in great clips' favor? boba tea two doors down!"
"i highly recommend great clips in mountain view. i've been going there for over 10 years now and they consistently do a great job for a great price. when you go ask for daniel. not only is he their excellent manager, but he also gives the best haircuts in town. thank you, daniel. you never let me down!"
great hair cut. pretty cheap. only thing is i wished my hair cutter had parted my hair where i wanted before starting to cut. i realized after the fact.
"i never knew of this place before donate blood to stanford blood center. on the day that i donate blood to stanford, i received a coupon for a free hair cut service provided by great clips. i was excited for the experience, since i needed a hair cut. when i first arrived to the store, the lady asked if i ever been to great clips and my answer was no. after my respond, she asked me to sit down then she served other customer who had actually been to the store and reserved a spot via online. i was like, that's find since i didn't made any reservation online, i don't mind waiting for a bit before getting a hair cut. 10 mins later, they called me up again and asked some of my basic information and asked me to take a sit and they will call me shortly after.after another 10 mins of wait, an elderly lady called my name and she asked me to come to her station then asked what kind of hair cut i wanted. i responded, i would want to have a clean cut and look sharp. she then responded, ""what is a clean cut? and what hand of tweezers i use?"" i responded, ""i don't know what kind of tweezers you have and i do not know the length of tweezers either"". she then spent so much time asking me about the tweezers and ignore the style that i asked her.overall, i had a bad hair cut. my bang was messed up (she literally used her scissor and cut a straight line.... i was like wtf???). how bad the hair cut is? i didn't go out for like 2 weeks and when ever i need to head out i feel like i need a hat to cover my head.... i feel the stylist (not sure if you can even call them stylist) need more professional training. but i guess i received a coupon and got a free hair cut, who can i blame?"
"had my hair cut twice now by daniel, and it has been great both times. he pays great attention to detail, and seems to enjoy what he's doing and has fun with his customers. definitely recommended."
"this is to praise diane, on 11/27/16 my mother and i went in to have my mom's haircut, she is handicap, has a walker, balding, and has hardly any hair, and diane was so very sweet to my mother, she helped her to the chair, listened, and most importantly, made my mom feel special. my mom left with smiles ear to ear. the lady directly across from diane wasn't so friendly, when making the appointment i had asked if they would be able to dry my moms hair after the cut, and she said it would be $20 just to blow dry. now if you saw my moms hair, you would understand that the cut would only take a few minutes (we could have cut it ourselves, but i wanted my mom to feel special), and to tell me after looking at my moms hair that it would cost $20 to blow dry it, you would understand. once diane finished cutting my moms hair, she offered to blow dry it, taking 2 minutes longer. i told her no because the lady said it would be $20 more. diane said she wasn't styling it, just blow drying it, and that is complementary. as diane started blow drying it, the rude lady directly across the way from her started yelling at her in her language (we knew exactly what about). diane then yelled back at her, we couldn't understand what they had said, but it was apparent the rude lady was telling her not to blow dry it. i was pleased diane had the heart to stand her ground.if y'all want a caring hairdresser, go see diane. she is a sweetie and will take care of you!"
"i took the 9 year old i watch here to get his hair cut. when we walked in the man at the counter didn't even acknowledge our presence, then a woman came from the back room to help check him in. after she got our information she began to walk back to where she was when another male customer walked in and the rude man who works there automatically greeted him and politely told him he would be with him momentarily. i was so annoyed and next time i will not be brining the kids here again. such a terrible experience."
"told me they were closed and made me turn off their open sign .   then laughed a bout it .  this was the second chance after one lady gave me  a off enter mohawk , after i asked for a medium fade...  bye bye ."
lan is awesome. she knows exactly how to cut my hair. it's also great to chat w her. my experience is fantastic because of her professionalism. i would not go elsewhere.
i've gotten decent haircuts here before. not bad for the price.. but if only the lady who cut my hair today spoke enough english to understand that i didn't want the style she was giving me. every time i asked for it shorter she just went to explain to me that my hair is thick because somehow i didn't know that already. note: now that i'm home and i've actual had a chance to look at my hair.. it looks a lot worse than i thought. not coming here again.
"my long-term stylist moved out of state almost a year ago and i've been searching ever since for my next long-term stylist, from fine salons to one person shops. a couple months ago i was desperate for a cut and popped into great clips after the gym with my fingers crossed. i was so happy to find gina! she listened to what i wanted and we took a couple of cuts to find our groove. i'm really happy with the cut, at a quarter of what i used to pay. looking forward to more great clips with gina!"
"my 5 star rating goes to pat the manager for my experience getting my hair done...great clips as well as super cuts get really bad reviews all the time. and i understand why! i've personally have had my hair destroyed before at different super cuts and great clips locations. and well i just don't have to money to afford a privately owned hair salon that charges $30-$100 for a hair cut. so i didn't give up hope. this time i contacted this location via yelp looking for a specific stylist with experience with curly hair (my hair is curly). the owner ray took the time to contact the manager and took interest in my concerns. once at the location pat the manager decided to work on my hair herself. she really took the time with my hair , understanding how it works and took everything i wanted into consideration. i can not speak for the rest of stylist but i did witness them doing lots of men hair cuts and they did pretty good. so for men, i think your safe with any stylist. as for the ladies who are scared to enter places like great clips, i understand your fears and anxieties very well and i can tell you that your safe in pat's hands. she's amazing and i will have her as go to hair stylist from now on."
"when it comes to getting my hair cut, i am low maintenance.  i do not want a shampoo, cut, color, and the whole works.  i just need a simple trim to get rid of my split ends and to somewhat keep the overall length.  great clips totally fits the bill.  no appointments are needed and wait time is relatively short especially if you check in online.  if you do not check in online, the wait time can be a tad long especially if you come at a busy time such as saturday morning.i've had my hair cut and trimmed by several of the stylists at this location.  i've never had a bad experience.  i usually just get a few inches cut off the back with a few layers throughout my hair.  i am usually in and out in 30 minutes.  just how i like it!  plus it is really cheap for a haircut, just under $20!"
very good people. the waiting time is short. i love my haircut and will definitely be coming again.
$17 for a men's hair cut. the lady didn't even put any after shave or polish on my head. bad attitude. what a waste of $17 bucks dude. i went because they open at 9am and i need to start my day. i was visiting from la.
"this place is really amazing and very friendly to little kids. the haircut was done great in spite the 3 yo customer was wiggling and screaming. staff is very nice, patient and friendly, and helpful the best way it only could be. waiting time was less than 2 minutes on saturday noon. we had a great experience and get back here for sure."
"my hair has many cowlicks so it is important that i find someone that can learn and cut my hair to minimize the impact of multiple cowlicks.  so when i find a hairstylist that shows they can meet the challenge, i stick with them.  and gina is the winner.  she has tamed the wildness of my cowlicks.  since i'm retired i can pick my time easily and she is usually ready or shortly thereafter.  one final touch is her ability to wash my hair without getting my collar wet!  easier said than done!  i highly recommend her!"
received a great haircut from gina again and will be returning again in two weeks. gina did a great job on listening and helping me create a great hairstyle for myself.
i went for a haircut on sunday afternoon and my stylist was shahnaz. she appeared to be a bad mood and she  wiped off half of my eye brow by mistake. she was so unprofessional that she did not point out her mistake and left it for me to find out until i got home. i complained to the manager and the owner and they were very cooperative and apologetic. they assured me that shahnaz would undergo further training to prevent this from happening again. i have been going to this great clips from last 4 years and i really like the rest of the staff. i sincerely hope this will not happen again.
"this is the 2nd time gina has cut my hair. i'm ecstatic about the results. i'm pretty high maintenance when it comes to getting my hair cut. i need to be able to communicate with the person who is working on my hair. she took her time and listened extremely well. i highly recommend gina as i will continue to use her as my ""go to"" person. she is definitively a keeper."
"ever since i moved to the south bay 5 years ago, i've been coming to this great clips location.  the best time to get a haircut is after 1:00 pm; basically after the lunch rush.  in the evenings around 5 or 6 pm, it gets pretty busy.  for this reason, i recommend downloading the great clips app so that you can check in ahead of time to get priority service.  the staff is very friendly and professional!  i used to always get a basic taper/fade (like drake), but they encouraged me to try something new.  so, i grew out my hair for a year (like mark wahlberg) and they introduced me to hair products (i.e., pomade and forming cream) and to blow dry my hair before applying them to give it some volume.  my favorite hair stylists are pat and kim, who usually do my comb over (mid) fade (like justin timberlake).  remember to tip your hairstylists!"
"worst salon to get your hairs chopped off. i tried it not even once or twice but three times for my son. every time it was not haircut,but shaving the hairs with the razor. the ladies are not ready to listen to your requirements but keep on insisting that they are correct. their only intention is to finish the haircut in 5 minutes. kindly don't waste time and money."
its nice and much professional way serve.no waiting queue and got the haircut the way i want.
"worst haircut i've ever had. extremely unprofessional.had to go to a different place to fix the ""great clip""."
quant is a true professional with a talent for connecting with people from all walks of lifekim is also excellent
"had a really bad experience today.my stylist was shahnaz. she seemed in a bad mood, may be due to sunday rush!i told her very specifically at the start that i didn't want square neckline, i wanted a tapered neckline.. she said she understood and still went ahead and did a square, that too a high square!then she charged me 17 usd for a haircut.. i thought usual great clips haircut charges are 14 usd.."
"worst haircut i've had in a long time. may be the stylist didnt understand my hair style. may be my hair texture was too different for her. may be she was having a bad day.either ways, i had a terrible month until my hair grew back.cut on march-10, ticket#280422"
"fantastic location and never a long wait because you can check in online. for being a budget salon they hire excellent stylists, especially kim and john.i never feel rushed and i get helpful advice about hair care.my kid always asks for kim and she sits completely still for her."
"worst customer service i've ever experienced! i was the only customer in the building, there were two stylists. i asked for a long bob cut, a very popular style, which neither stylist knew how to cut, so i had to search for pictures. i asked for textured ends, which jaqueline only did in the back of my hair, no where else. then length was rather longer than i wanted, and the cut only took about 8 minutes total, so i asked if she minded taking a bit more off. she threw her hands up, rolled her eyes, and said ""see you need to say these things early on because now you're making me look bad and now i have to touch up your hair all over"". i apologized and told her- i'm sorry this is a new hairstyle for me and i thought i would ask because there were no other customers there and the haircut was done and over with extremely fast. she and the other stylist were lecturing me and acting very annoyed. i decided to leave after feeling berated and embarrassed by them. i would understand if they had been busy, but come on- i was the only one there and the haircut was so brief it's not like it was a complicated haircut. i will never recommend this place."
"really bad experience. this hair cutter who was doing my hair screwed up my hair. she cut it too short. way too short than the picture i showed her. she told me ""oh, your hair is not going to be exactly the same as the person in the picture because your hair is different."" she cut it nothing like what i showed her in the picture. she cut it way too fucking short. the person who cut my hair is so fucking incompetent. can't cut hair, so don't ever go to great clips. no wonder their prices are so low. it's because they do shitty work. never going to this great clips place ever again!"
"an absolutely great way to start the day. walked in and was greeted with a smile. her name is nena and she is highly recommended. i was invited into a chair, we talked about my mess of hair, decided what we were going to do and got right to it. she offered an upgrade but i didn't want it. but once we started talking and i was feeling good. i asked for the mvp.  best decision. warm towel, hair washed, product put in, massaged my neck and shoulders, and facial massage too!great way to start the day!as i was getting all bundled up ready to leave, she was going over the cost for everything, she mentioned i was in before 11... discount!  what an amazing stylist and i will enjoy the rest of my day immensely.thank you nena. such a great price for everything i received. when my wife goes to those other places they cost way more and they don't show sports!!  i'll be back!!"
"avoid this location!! the stylists are uninterested and absolutely not dedicated to their craft, let alone decent customer service. if you must go to a sports clips, the employees down the street at the lincoln park location are much more likely to make you feel welcome and comfortable."
"haircut was fine but the only reason i came was because a coupon i got in the mail for a $9 haircut a week ago. i thought, ""why not"". when i got done i presented the coupon and the stylist pointed out it expires in 2013... now why would i be receiving a coupon in 2018 that expires in 2013? must of been a typo by the marketing team but they refused to honor the coupon and made me full price. if i was going to pay full price, i definitely have much better options. i don't care about the money but it's just rude customer service in my opinion."
"i'm from austin/georgetown texas, so very familiar with sportclips.  while i am somewhat picky about how my hair is cut, i always manage to find someone at sportclips that can do a good job.  brenda at this location is no exception!  she is very nice, and has done an excellent job at making me look good, on multiple occasions.  i was having trouble finding a job, so not only did she hook me up with a great haircut, but comforted me and listened to me vent a little.  it made a huge impact!"
"excellent atmosphere, stylist didnt talk much till it came time to promote products.one of they only sportclips in country with massage chairs.  but one of the best mvp curs ive had in a long time.....excellent location by the friendly confines of wrigley..stop by before a cardinals...i mean cubs game"
"just got a pretty bad haircut here. very rushed, the sides of my hair are uneven, stylist did not seem to interested in giving me a nice haircut. no way will i pay 20 dollars again for a haircut like that, there are way better places in chicago. i should have listened to the other yelp reviews."
"got my haircut here today, and i was really pleased. my stylist, mary, was very friendly and did a great job. she listened to what i wanted and did just that. i got the treatment with the steamed towel, and the extra few dollars are definitely worth it. the place was clean, atmosphere was cool, staff was friendly, so i'll be back."
my boyfriend just waited 30 minutes to get his hair cut and the stylists let 2 people cut him. it was ridiculous. he was on his lunch break and did not have an hour to dedicate. do not go here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what terrible customer service.
"friendly staff, reasonable prices and i get to watch sports while i get my hair cut- what more can i ask for?  they do a reasonable and consistent job with the hair-cut.   i recommend that you upgrade to the mvp with the hot towel, scalp massage etc.oh, and the free trim between haircuts is a great feature too."
"i tried sportsclips a few times as they are just a short walk from my residence, but feel that they are overpriced for the quality of service you receive. it seems as though most of the people working there are novices. i received some decent haircuts, but also a couple of bad ones. they tend to use primarily clippers rather than scissors. basically sports clips is your typical $8 haircut place (i.e. greatclips, superclips etc.) that creates a ""manly"" environment through having a sports theme (i.e. stadium style seating in the waiting area, the staff wears referee shirts, they show sports games on tv and have memorabilia on the walls etc.) - and then they jack the price up to nearly  triple what a greatclips or superclips charges. to me the sports theme comes across as a bit cheesy and overdone and certainly does not justify charging $20 plus for an $8 quality haircut.there are some pluses to sportsclips; they do often have coupons out there that knock a few bucks off the cost, no appointment is needed and for a few bucks extra you can receive a mini spa package including a shampoo, steamed towel and mini massage (again none of this is fancy, but it adds a bit to the experience). if you are a male in your teens or early twenties you may find sportsclips entertaining and enjoy the experience, but i do not believe it is a good option for anybody outside of this demographic. you can pay about $10 to $15 more and have a much more professional haircut performed at a myriad of other nearby facilities or you can pay $12 less and have the same quality haircut without the sports theme."
"great atmosphere and they cut my hair the way i want it done...tough to ask for anything more.  during peak hours the wait can be a little long though, so i would recommend not going 5-7pm on a weekday."
i've been going to sportclips for haircuts for about 2 years now and i'm pleased with the service that i receive here.  the women cutting your hair all do a good job and are pretty consistent from one to the other.  it's nice to have a sports themed place to go where there are games on the tvs and the people cutting your hair can also talk sports.i've had each level of haircut here and the massage and hot towel are defintely nice touches when i do get them.  it's also worth noting that the hot towel and massage are more than just going through the motions - you actually have time to enjoy both.another nice service is that if you are a return customer they capture your information in the system so each time you return they know how you like your hair cut.
"i consistently get a good haircut here with little to no wait, and being able to watch espn makes the time pass quickly. i don't get the hooters comparison that some other yelper had alluded to...perhaps he was trying to be funny. anyway, i've been coming here for over a year now and am a satisfied customer. the stylists are personable, professional, and give good haircuts. the hot towel and scalp massage are nice if you opt for the mvp, though the neck&shoulder massage is nothing special.other yelpers have complained about ""upselling,"" but as a regular who knows what they want and/or don't want, the upselling can be handled with a polite ""no thanks"" or two.be sure to fill out the receipt survey (it takes about 2 minutes) for three bucks off your next haircut."
"nice haircut, but without the shave what good are the other services, like a hot towel? sure it feels nice, but it is only half the service.  i'd like the service better if they added a shave with or without a straight razor."
"i got a haircut here on 02/17. i'll get the easy part out of the way - the haircut was fine. she did a nice job. no big deal.the turnoff for me was the constant selling of their products/services. walking in, i gave my name, email and phone number. then i heard about the 3 different service levels they have. then i had to choose. then i had to hear about it again while i was in the chair.it goes a little like this:basic haircut = $17haircut with neck massage, shampoo, and hot towel on the face: $22i didn't mind being asked what i wanted. but i resented the constant ""up selling"" and explanation of service. i just wanted a haircut. and i felt like i had to keep justifying it. for instance, when she brushed the hair out of my face, she again told me that i could pay extra for the shampoo so i wouldn't have that problem later in the day.i typically get my haircut at gabbys (on clark, north of diversey). a haircut there is $15 and includes a neck shave with a straight razor! i've also had them shampoo me before and they didn't charge me anything extra. and don't get me started on the atmosphere at gabbys - tons of great magazines, laid-back attitude, great music, nice people, etc.i chose to go to sport clips on this particular day because i figured that gabby's would have been packed. i will not make that mistake again. gabbys is a far superior experience and (when necessary), worth the wait."
good haircuts with a relaxing scalp massage when you're getting your hair cleaned.  also the guy that owns this one gives a discount to first responders and military.
"super under-rated haircut place. it's good service, friendly staff, and pretty reasonable. i've gone to other locations, but it seems the staff here is generally the best. great for value guys like me."
"i was at marshall's this weekend and found a coupon. as i was in need of a trim i walked in on a saturday evening. the staff was fun and courteous. rachel my stylist was perky, attentive and made some great suggestions. i am busy so time is important to me but i will gladly  take the time for a 30 minute spa treatment with sports on the tube any day. the top of the line treatment including a cut, body massage chair during the shampoo with paul mitchell products, neck and scalp massage, and a hot face towel all for under $25.00! you've got to be kidding me. i went ahead and purchased the multi-cut deal to lock in the low intro price. i look forward to my next spa session in 2- 3 weeks cuz trims are free!"
"the staff are very professional and they take their jobs seriously. my hair dresser is amazing because she pays attention to little details that no one would. i have been going there for 4 months and she knows me so well, she knows what to do with my hair right away."
picture hooters opening a hair salon.i feel bad for the women working here.
"molly was very friendly and the complimentary mvp package as a first timer was luxurious.they don't do line ups which was disappointing but overall, i would come back."
"i gravitate towards sc locations no matter what city i'm in because i know what to expect.  when trying out a new barber, there's always the danger of the unexpected: they don't take walkins, they don't take credit cards, there's a long wait, etc.  but sc has standardized service (as much as they can standardize service across so many different barbers), so i know what i'm in for.  at this location, there's usually a wait, but there's enough stuff in the area that you can go get a sandwich or a coffee and come back in a few minutes.  they're pretty good at estimating the wait times.  plus, they do a good job, and the barbers are friendly."
"been here many times, showed up at 7:45pm and was told they are closed. guess i won't ever go back. i realize you want to go home, but at least lock the front door. also, why do you have hours in the door if you don't follow them?"
i had the greatest service for a decent price! i was very well taken care of and my hair looks awesome :) i'm totally coming here again
"high turnover, went here off and on for almost 4 years and never even saw the same person let alone had my hair cut by the same person. cuts were always mediocre. generally good if you need to get in and out quickly."
"sport clips is like the buffalo wild wings of barbershops. super chain-y from the décor to the ""welcome to sport clips, we'll be with you in a moment"" greeting, but i definitely dig it. although it's not an actual barbershop that does straight razor shaves, this salon totally appeals to the male demo. from the tv's touting sports games to the flirty stylists, it's just got an overall dude vibe...obviously. ultimately, they do a decent doo for a fair price, (about $18) and they'll line you up in the back for free anytime you need it so that's a big plus. if you want something super stylish it might not be your bag, but if your head is like mine and doesn't require much maintenance i'd definitely rec it."
"if you want a decent haircut, this is not the place. the cut was done very fast is not clean at all. i will not go there again."
"just horrible!!! if u r looking for a quick i-don't-care-how-it-turns out haircut then this is the place. very unprofessional and crude. the reason why i am giving them 1 star is because the ""stylist"" did not charge me for the haircut because she realized she completely screwed up mine. i guess they do that a lot. stay away if u are looking for a decent hair cut."
"if you are looking to be in and out on your lunch break this is the place to go. if you are looking for someone to spend the time to make sure every strand of hair on your head is perfect, this is not the place.you get what you pay for here,  medium price medium look. but the workers are friendly which is awesome. id go again if just looking for a quick cut."
"first time customers get a free upgrade to the ""full service cut"" that includes shampoo, hot towel, etc.mid-day during the week the place was empty and service fast. happy with the haircut."
"pretty good haircut for 18 bucks. nadia did a good job on my old-guy hair. the locker room theme is a little hokey, but give them credit for trying something different."
"don't know why yelp deleted my previous review. do not go to this place for a haircut.  and do not have ""nicole"", cut your hair.  i went in last night for a haircut after work.  i showed her a photo (front, side, and back views) of myself from a haircut i had few months ago.  i told her i wanted the same haircut (about 1.5"" on the top, with sides and back faded at very short 1 clippers).  she said okay, took off my glasses, and proceeded to buzz my sides and back (which was fine).  then without saying anything she started grabbing my hair (from the top of my head) and clipping it off....all the way to only 1/2"" left on the top.  when she was finally done, it looked completely horrible.  it looked nothing like the self photos i had shown her.  i had planned on leaving a $10 tip since i came in with a coupon.  when i saw how horrible my cut looked, i just walked out....since complaining wouldn't do anything since there was no hair left to fix.  :("
"woowhad an awesome girlfriend and everything was going fine until i got my haircut here at sports clips. one side of my hair wasn't even the same length. sure enough, she breaks up with me today. thanks a lot."
place was pretty empty when i went in. they have a bunch of tvs and it they tried to make the place into a man cave. the people working there are really nice. they do a good job cutting hair as well. they gave me a shampoo and a head massage at the end too!
had nadia and i must say that her customer service was excellent! i look forward to have her to do my haircut again.
the online system needs a lot of work.  i reserved an appointment with the same stylist that cuts my hair every time.  i arrived at the recommended time but when i got there i was told that the person had already left for the day.  i asked why the online system would allow you to reserve an appointment with someone who is leaving soon and was told that the system doesn't account for this.  so you have to call to verify that the stylist you want to go with is there because the online system can't be trusted.  totally defeats the purpose.  other than that i like the place so...3 stars.
"so when's the last time you got a haircut where you get in the car, check the rear view-mirror and think god-damn i look good. i had mine recently, compliments of monica. can't wait for it to grow out so i can see her again. it's a bittersweet, but more sweet than bitter. until we meet again, monica."
do not go here. i just took my eight year old son for the first time and the hair dresser cut his ear and then blamed him. which is impossible because his hands were under the cape. thank goodness i was standing right next to him and could argue with her. she also gave him the worst fade he has ever received. she barley brushed his hair before she started and so it is all uneven. and at the very end she had the nerve to try to charge us $17 for the haircut even though he was still bleeding; i refused. she also claimed she had no way of helping me clean his wound but that she sterilized her equipment each morning so he should be fine. this was the worst experience i have ever seen.
"the only way to check in is on-line, and no way to select a time.   just before i left my office at 4:40, 0 min wait.  no way to reserve 5:30 spot.  when i called to ask, no help.  got to store at 5:30, now there is a 30 min wait.  goofy system.  waste of time."
"sportclips: now offering everything except haircuts!after what was easily one of the worst days in recent memory, i came here looking forward to a decent haircut experience.  that, i did not receive.maybe the sign that i was the only customer at 6pm on a weeknight should've tipped me off, but i wasn't phased.  as is the sport clips way, a stylist will greet you with a handshake and their name.  my stylist offered perhaps the weakest handshake in the history of the world, another bad indicator. she was a lousy conversationalist; the small talk was strained and not at all natural.  it actually felt like a bad first date, when you run out of things to discuss.  ""soo.....you lived here long?""  i can only carry the conversation so far, you've gotta at least meet me halfway.the haircut quality was acceptable but nothing groundbreaking.  what bothered me was her method: she used zero talcum powder and neglected to brush away loose hair, of which there was plenty.  several times i had to reach up and swat away big clumps of my own hair from my face, which i'm fairly certain is her responsibility, not the customer's.i never went to beauty school, but i'm also pretty sure you're supposed to adequately wet your customer's hair before cutting it.  since she didn't, those scary ass garden shears pulled my delicate hair out by the roots instead of neatly trimming it.  so that felt good.....not.whatever, i was glad to be done with that hair-filled torture chamber, and i made my way to the front to pay.  apparently they've added a new, exceedingly dumb option to their lineup: something called 'the stanley cup', which from what i can gather is a day-long process where you get a quadruple head shampoo, an hour's worth of massager, and 6x hot towel treatment.  pretty much everything except an under-the-table handy (or maybe that's included?)i'm reminded of the movie idiocracy where notsure walks past a starbucks and sees choices for a $2 latte, $200 'hot' latte, $2000 'full body' latte.  or the pollo borracho offering a bucket of wings with 'full release'.  like what sort of bogus freaking ponzi scheme nonsense is this oak park sport clips trying to get away with???what's even more peculiar is that this so-called ""stanley cup"" deluxe treatment is strangely absent on sport clips' website.  no mention whatsoever.  this goofy service can't be found at elmhurst.  or at darien.  or willowbrook.  or lombard.  only here, for some strange reason......hmmm.......the final blow came when i got rung up for $21.  a 'precision haircut' is only $17, always has been.  i briefly protested and she said ""we only offer the triple play, mvp, and stanley cup.""  that's right, you can't even get a simple haircut anymore.  only deluxe treatment for an insane upcharge.if you're in a rush and don't have time to screw around with a scalp massage or back vibrator and want just the basic haircut, you're forced to pay the same price as those who get massaged & vibrated.  ridiculous.when i pressed the matter, the only response i got was: ""oh, this one is different.""  yeah, no sh*t.  the other locations might not be great, but this one downright sucks.  truth be told, i was looking for a reason to find another haircuttery place (like haircuttery?) and this sport clips experience -- my last -- was the straw that broke the camel's back.with only one other review for this relatively new location, my 1* is going to hurt them more than it normally would, but i have little remorse.  their greed has lost them consistent business.say sayonara to a lifelong customer, you shady bastards!"
"today i went to this location before work.  i was there promptly at 10am, but the door was locked until about 5 after.  no big deal.i asked the stylist if she would accept the coupon off my phone.  she said that she must staple the paper coupon to the receipt.  i was obviously frustrated, but agreed and got a haircut.  the actual haircut is passable.  however, i agree with other posts that the upcharge for extra services is not reasonable.at the end of the haircut, when prompted to leave a tip and a donation, i declined.  the stylist asked if i was having a bad day.  well, yes, i said.  and reminded her that she declined to take my coupon.  she retorted that she gave me a good haircut and that is no reason not to leave a tip.excuse me!?!  did a sportclips employee just ask me for a tip?  while my credit card was in the machine processing, i asked to speak to a manger.""we don't have managers here,"" she told me.  i insisted on a number to call.  she told me that if i did not complete the transaction, she would call the police!never have i spent money in an establishment and been threatened with arrest.  she explained that if i was not happy with the service, ""you don't have to come back.""i never raised my voice, used profanity, or otherwise showed any disrespect to this employee, her colleague or other customers.  following payment, i again insisted on speaking with a manager.  this time, she gave me a business card for an ""area manager.""so to summarize:store opened latedeclined my couponexpected a tip and a donation on top of high priceemployee lied about having a manageremployee threatened to call the cops on a paying customeremployee reminded me that if i am not satisfied, i can take my business elsewhere.got it.  next time i will."
"i would never recommend this sport clips to anybody. i have come here a few times now and every time i leave i am disappointed. when i sit down in their chair i feel like another commission as they don't care about precision or quality. they only want to get you in and out. one time an employee was so rushed and sloppy. i later found out she was leaving in 10 minutes and wanted to make another sale. overall, i never recommend this location to anybody looking for a quality haircut. i am truly disgusted with this place."
"grand opening june 24-26. free 1&1/2 hour parking in neighboring holley court garage. located next to trader joes. revised hours 9am-8pm m-f, 8am-6pm sat, 10am-5pm sunday. try the mvp haircut for free with a coupon from the valpak mailers."
"this place gave me the worst haircut i've ever had, and then broke its own record the next time i went. the employees couldn't cut a lime if needed. on top of that, the ""sports atmosphere"" reminds me of my nephew's baseball bedroom decor.i have been going to different cheap franchise hair salons for the past 8 years, and this company and specific location has been the worst by far. the only reason i went twice was because they gave me a ""free haircut"" coupon. i was wrong when i thought i'd get a better cut the second time.the employees had no idea how to listen to what i'd like, specifically jennifer. my hair was cut the only way she knew how to cut hair, so tough luck for me. every time i asked for a minor adjustment, she would cut all my hair shorter as well, while chatting with other employees. she also wet my hair and combed it over in a way i never have before, and when i told her i don't want it cut to that style, she made up an excuse to keep it combed that way so she can cut it how i like. i came out with a buzz cut, while jennifer complimented her own work to make me feel more comfortable with what i paid for. and if you don't style your hair, it doesn't matter. after telling her twice i didn't want any styling cream, she put a lot on anyway. very very rude.i don't see this place lasting much longer. it's a styling cream store disguised as a hair salon. poor cuts=more styling cream sales. if you have hair longer than an inch, i recommend going somewhere, anywhere else. if you don't like others telling you how to wear your own hair, i don't recommend this place."
"found a free mvp haircut ($23 value!) in the money mailer for the location in my neighborhood - oak park, il. despite the negative reviews i wanted to see for myself - hey free $23 haircut is a good deal! i printed out a coupon for myself and son. i came in on a lazy sunday afternoon. no real wait - 3 of the 4 chairs were occupied. i was greeted promptly and the lady's were nice and attentive. the place is clean and in a nice area! huge 70"" flatscreen lcd in waiting room playing football. my son got his hair cut 1st. i explained the cut to our stylist, januari: 1-2 fade on the sides, short up top, combed forward, spiked up front. she cut exactly as explained. clean, tight fade. the mvp includes shampoo and conditioner, hot towel and massage...really? wow, ok... my son gets the whole treatment and i'm envious. i don't recall getting this treatment myself, ever. i confirmed with januari, that this was free with the coupon - it was. so my son get's the cut, massage chair, hot shampoo and hot towel. all done, he looked refreshed, nice tight hair cut. job well done januari! thanks! i tipped her well. my son looks great. it was 5pm and closing time so i didn't get my cut. i'll be coming back this week though.  i kinda interviewed the beauticians there to see how long they've been cutting hair. januari about 10 years, jennifer, over 10. that's good enough experience for me. also... they guarantee their haircuts, if you don't like the cut you don't pay. i'll be back this week to get my mvp treatment. again... free with the coupon. i love that business model! forego the expensive tv commercial, pass the savings to the client... invokes the law of reciprocity. i feel appreciative for the free cut, now they've made a client. i'll be back regularly to patronize this business. i'll update the review once i get my haircut. in my experience great place!update 02-07-2017came back to get my haircut on a busy saturday. all 6 chairs had customers getting haircuts but wait area was open. clean as always. watched superbowl 51 previews on big screen. short wait, about 10 minutes, before i was called back. i was able to see the haircuts of the other patrons and have to say i was very impressed. these girls can cut hair! januari asked how i wanted it and explained to her. she cut it exactly how as explained. she checked with me during and after the cut to get my approval. a-ok. after the cut, i received rest of the mvp package: the hot towel, hair shampoo/conditioner treatment and massage. very nice job with everything. i'm very satisfied and happy with service and tipped her accordingly. i'll be coming back regularly."
service excellent.  hairstylists friendly and patient.  value is off the charts.  they have reinvented a style for me that has carried well over the past year.  i really appreciate their staff and especially their manager!    i would highly recommend this as your go to place as you will get great customer service from a staff that smiles and actually enjoys what they do.
got a great hair cut and unexpected scalp massage from kate. the experience was great. thanks kate. now i am rhyming and i didn't even mean it lol. ask for kate!
"i've been coming here for 2 and a half years and i think i'm finally at the point where i'm switching. my hair cut is easy, 3-5 on the sides and a trim on top. i say that every time and, yet, the employees here keep doing other things to my head. almost  every time i've gone, i've put up with the hard sell on paying to have my hair (re) washed (with excuses ranging from ""it makes it easier to cut"" to ""you have to"").lately it has gotten worse. more often, during the shampoo, i'm surprised with a hot towel and scalp massage (surprise! now you're paying for an mvp you didn't want, ask for, or ever discuss with your stylist).the last few times, they've shaved my neck without asking, raising my neckline at least an inch. i'm not sure how to protest this. they don't ask, we had only discussed a trim, and by the time i realize they're doing it, i need them to finish to make it even."
i been knowing diana for 5 years. i follow her everywhere she goes. she always cuts my hair perfectly. now that she's working here at sports clips i make my appointments from my phone.
"i have had several great experiences here, but that is largely due to diana perez, who has cut my hair for years.  i have followed her from another location to here because she is that good.  she takes her time to make sure you have exactly what you want.  she is not one to rush a haircut - you are her priority.  make sure you ask for diana when coming here!  you will end up going back time and time again."
"i had never been to a sport clips until diana,  my stylist, started working there this past fall.diana is the best!  always have an enjoyable visit.  she's a talented stylist,  a true professional and great person.  try the mvp service which includes a light massage, hair wash and a hot towel facial treatment, you won't be sorry...and ask for or schedule an appointment with diana.i've had my hair cut by 2 other stylists at this location and they both did a great job too but diana rocks it!"
"this sport clips is a gem because of 4 factors. first it's the location where you could get free adjacent parking at whole foods. second the shop is spacious and clean, with ample waiting room with big led screen. third, the staff are super friendly, jovial, and will always greet you with sweet smiles. my usual go-to is certainly diana, as she is meticulous, skillful, and handle your hairs with extra tlc! i recommend diana and this sport clip without  any reservation."
"i've been here a bunch of times, but the score is super low because my haircut was done by someone in store management.i showered an hour before and made sure my hair was dry before i rode my bike over.  i wear a helmet so there was a mark in the hair and i got a hard sell on a wash.  it combined/sprayed out easily though.  it doesn't explain how the fade in the back goes from a 1 or 2 buzzer to a scissor cut.  they haven't had a problem with this before.  i didn't realize how bad it was until i got home.  thy didn't ask about how i wanted my neckline, or give me a mirror to view the back.  i got interrogated about what hair gel i use, assuming for the sell.   all of this as shes throwing the tools back onto her work surface.never, ever going he again."
had a great haircut andconversation with the stylist . my favorite part aside from a nice haircut  is having a real scalp massage with the hair wash  and the  back massage machine they use.  i will be back
"must ask for diana for 5 star experience!! other than giving the best haircut and shampoo, she is an active listener and a very caring family oriented woman! i always tip her extra and feel very good about it! i followed her to many places and sportsclips is lucky to have her!! this facility is well taken care of and i recommend vip treatment!!"
always been satisfied with my haircut here. i've tried more expensive as well as cheaper options in the area but none seem to get it quite right. i love the haircut i just got from ashley gardner. one of the many great stylists at this location.
"my husband has been coming here since they've opened and loves it. he always gets a good cut and enjoys the warm towel treatment also. other side note: i think it's really great they give vets free hair cuts on veterans day. more companies should consider doing this, it's a nice thing to do and creates goodwill in the community."
"best hair cut i've ever had -- and my mom is a professional hair stylist.charli was great. talented, funny, and a baseball fan? i'll be back.ps - i hope my mom doesn't read this."
so glad i found this place. i received a free haircut in the mail for first time clients and decided to give this place a try. my stylists name was charli and she did an awesome job. she listened to exactly what i had asked for and paid close attention to detail. i am so happy there's a good haircut place close to my house. bonus- they play sports on tv and give a great shampoo massage!
"i have gotten my hair cut at high end salons all the way down to fantastic sam's. i keep coming back to this particular sport clips, not only because it is convenient to park for free and is close to home, but because of the staff. charli lyn has been cutting my hair the last few times i have been in. she is great.ni'm not sure how long she has been in the business but she goes above and beyond for a stylist at a national chain. she always makes me feel like a friend and keeps it professional. keep up the great cuts guys!"
great service and a friendly staff. charli is my go to girl and always provides stellar service .
"beware...it says free neck trim in the window,  but that's only for people in their system who have gotten a cut there before. the girls are nice though ...it's a corporate thing, not a problem with the nice ladies at this location"
this spot got new ownership from the river north location and they're really good. i usually go to the river north one but i moved to lakeview and i'm glad sports clips is just as good here. got the mvp as usual and the stylists knew exactly what i wanted still and gave me the same perfect cut.
owner reached out after a bad experience. solid guy. a bad experience or employee is sometimes unavoidable and it says a lot to take responsibility and try to make things right.
1.  stop trying to sell me stuff!!!  it's annoying!!2.  all your sports posters and trash cans remind me of a little kids bedroom.3.  your prices aren't good.  hair cuttery across the street is cheaper and simpler.three stars only because you have tv's to watch.
"this place was so bad that i politely asked the hairdresser to stop my haircut so i could go somewhere else to get it fixed.i ended up with this weird line on the side of my head. the hairline on the back of my head was completely lopsided. i'm not terribly picky when it comes to my hair, but i know i won't be back to this place."
great place to get a haircut! got my hair and beard cut by dana and love the outcome! would definitely recommend her for cutting your hair/beard!
"whatever happened to customer service? part 2so, i had gone to sports clips in west chicago (you can read that review) which led me here.  i walk up to the counter where two employees stood.  one asks me if i had been there before and i said i had not.  so, she flips around the pad that is screwed onto the counter and tells me to put in my information?  what?  isn't that something they do? isn't their system that they know how to navigate easier for them to fill out.  isn't ""connecting"" with a customer part of the corporate business plan for sports clip? because this whole ""do it yourself"" attitude seems to be at every shop. again, i ask, whatever happened to customer service?  a little interaction goes a long way.  they were standing right in front of me.  couldn't they spend a few minutes talking to a new client? i was actually a little bit taken aback by the whole thing to the point i stood there a few seconds thinking about whether i wanted to waste my time doing their job for them.  i decided i did not and i left. i ended up at supercuts down the road and, guess what, although both of the stylists were busy.  one took the time to greet me, ask if i could wait just a few minutes while she finished up her client, and offered me a water.  see, now, that wasn't that hard.  talk to the client.  acknowledge  he or she is the client.  be nice.  do your job.  that is customer service.  i am done with sports clips, though i had been a regular customer at other shops."
"i have not been here in a while. took a break to try other places. now that i have returned i am glad that i have. i received fast, friendly service and a good haircut as well. i was taken care of by perry and she did a great job."
been here three times for a shape up - they never seem to understand the phrase 'keep my natural line.' lesson learned. if you don't really care about your cut - sure come here. otherwise i'd stay away.
ask for ashly or  perry. they are cool and have good  barber fading and  stylist skills. went to get s cut right before the game and got to watch the start while in the chair. changes the whole sunday routine now that i can get a cut during the game and not miss any of it.  friendly and clean service. they do a very good job here.
"first time  there, had a great experience, alise cut my hair and she did it exactly how i wanted it. definitely go back and have her cut it again!"
"the girl who cut my hair (forgot her name?!) did a great job. she was friendly, smart and gave me a sharp, clean cut. the hot towel treatment is very relaxing if you don't mind spending a bit more. recommended!"
got here for the first time and got greeted right away. i was told to log in and put my information on their tablet so i did. it didn't take long for me to get my hair cut. i got a massage hair washed dried and as well as hot towel. overall it was a good experience.
"my boyfriend and i decided to stop on in to get him a haircut since it was right near costco. he told the girl exactly what he wanted and how he wanted it done. being an all male barbershop, you would expect these females to know how to cut and trim hair, right ? wrong . first of all the woman couldn't even do a simple lining, talking about how she doesn't have the proper tools to do so. how does a male salon not have the tools to do so?  it seemed as if she didn't even know how to properly ""clean"" up a guys hair. when my boyfriend called me over for my opinion, the lining wasn't straight and she looked as if she was nervous the whole entire time. his hair grows back fast so we definitely won't  be stopping here again."
"we normally have no issues with sports clip chain. but i brought my son to this sports clip, closer to my house, being his first time there, he should have triple play new customer price. that didn't happen. also, i had to ask her to wash his hair after the cut. no hot towel, or massage. but was charge that. not only that, next morning. my son woke up with his hair sticking up! if the cut was done properly, it would not have happened. been to other sports clip and did not have any issue with the cut. will not be coming back to this sports clip. no matter how close they r."
"the service is friendly, the quality of cut is good for cleanups and quick drop ins...and the price is right."
awesome service girls my boyfriend loves his cut and loved the real barbershop atmosphere see you guys in 6 weeks
"my hair was several inches long.  i asked kate for a straight side, flat top crew cut.  i got a sourball.  thanks a lot.  now i look like a kid.  good thing it grows back so i can go somewhere else to fix this."
got here on a saturday afternoon with no appointment and got right in the chair. jessica was super helpful and knowledgeable about the various products that they had to offer and their benefits. haircut went great! the head massage was great too!
"great location with friendly and cheerful staff!vanessa is my go-to stylist.  very informative, remembers your style, and provides valuable input!"
jessica is a very experienced stylist. my son is always satisfied with his haircut ! jen s.
"a great location to get a haircut i was drinking a beer minutes after i walked out of the store. really liked my cut and the stylist made suggestions for my cut which i much prefer over ""how would you like your hair cut. ""my usual reply is ( with scissors!) recommend this location especially good value compared to other options in the area. updating this as jessica was awesome great beard trim as well .6-7 stylists in the storeso didn't wait at all"
"i usually cut my sons hair every month or every other month just because he hates haircuts so i was in the area and decided to give it a shot at attempting to get a haircut! we walked in and walked over a friendly face girl which i clearly remember her name is wendy because my sons favorite place is wendys! :) so right off the bat i knew it would run smooth because my son smiled at her. she listened to my instructions and was super patient, and to my surprise my son stood still the whole time!! i absolutely loved the haircut, the ambience, the price, and of course wendy!"
"i would give this store a 5 rating if i was only rating jessica. she is an excellent stylist with an engaging personality. but i went to the store needing a hair cut before a business meeting, and it was jessica's day off. i got a cut from vanessa. after she finished i kept wondering why she was combing my hair in a completely different way from the way i told her. when i got home i found out why. when i comb my hair the way i normally do, it looks like i have a bald spot around the area of the part. i really should give the store a lower rating, but i've had too many good hair cuts from jessica. she is great and if she is not in, then you might want to wait."
"horrible experience, manager tried selling me a bunch of unnecessary garbage. if you cater to men, you should understand men. not every guy is a metro hipster. $50 on hair product is beyond silly."
erica knows what she's doing. will definitely come back for another cut next time!
"i came here 3 months ago and found jessica and mimi, both wonderful and professional."
"for a guy like me who's been obsessed my entire life with my hair, how to style it, and what product to use, ruth montero is a dream come true. her expertise at knowing how to tame my cowlick and other challenges is even more remarkable when you consider how quickly she works. a combination of professional and perky, ruth sends me out looking better and feeling terrific."
"i have been a loyal customer of this sport clips location for the past two years.  jessica is a great stylist and the new check-in feature is awesome.  i would highly recommend jessica, and many of the other stylists are excellent as well."
"no appointment but was taken right away.  had a free upgrade to the mvp package which is the haircut, shampoo (in a chair which gives you a short massage) warm towel on face for a couple minutes, and a shoulder massage. it was nice, but i wouldn't do it on a regular basis.  too expensive, even with free upgrade.stylist jay was nice and had interesting stories."
wow!!  what a great hair cut.   professional service.   i love going there.   always a professional and never been unhappy with the cut.   i have been coming here for over 3 years and still am very happy.
great people!! fast service!!! very happy!!definetly bringing my kids back.did not have to wait at all because they accept walk ins.. so happy.
"i met jessica 3 yrs ago & ever since, i have been one of her most loyal customers!! i have been following her ever since!! jessica is not only the most welcoming stylist, but one of the best!!she's always very friendly & professional!!! she always does a great job!!"
amazing service! the place is well managed & designers are top notch. it's hard to find great barber but this place epitomizes top notch service & great hair cut.
"i got a hair cut here tonight and the back is completely uneven. it's borderline absurd. the stylist clearly wasn't paying attention. also, i can actually see many hairs on the sides and top that she missed. i won't be coming back unless it's at a discounted price with a different stylist. the lesson here is to never leave supercuts."
consistently great cuts no matter which stylist i have used. friendly and professional service. with on-line check in it has become even more convenient. i have recommended sportclips to others and they have not been disappointed.
first review on yelp. worst haircut i've ever gotten. butchered the sides like i didn't think was even possible. will never go here again or recommend to anybody.
jessica does an awesome job. great deal for the money! they even throw in a free trim if you come back within 30 days!
"i moved a block away from this sports clips location a year ago, and have had nothing but great experiences here. today i had mimi as a stylist and she absolutely crushed it. i have a scar on my head and don't usually cut lower than a 6 on the sides. i told mimi i wanted to switch it up and go as short as possible on the sides without my scar showing too much. the haircut turned out awesome, with a short fade (0-4) in the back which is a new style for me. she definitely took her time to make sure the cut turned out just right, and i appreciate her not rushing through to get to the next client. all of the other stylists i've had here have been great too! selene did great last month. definitely recommend"
"if you're looking for an excellent haircut suited for your style, go see ashley. i continually travel out of my way just to get my perfect haircut from her. you should too."
"i have been coming to this salon from past 2 years. my hairdresser mimi, she's awesome. i have been her client since 2 years and i have never got disappointed by the service and my haircut.whenever she do my haircut, i don't know what magic she do? she give my hair a professional look all the time just like hairstyle we see of movie actors!"
"so i came to this store because it was closest in distance. all i can say is i'm glad i didn't go anywhere else. mimi the assistant manager has cut my hair several times and i always leave 1000% assured that i'm gonna leave the store looking good. she's an awesome person with a charismatic personality, i wouldn't go anywhere else now. today, shelby cut my hair and i have to say this location has the best stylists. they're awesome people and i can't wait to come back. thank you guys again, it's a pleasure, like always."
"i spent a lot of time looking for a good haircut in this neighborhood until i found mimi! she is really professional and have many years of experience, she is more a image consultant since she knows what type of hair style fits you better. on the other hand you'll have a good time to relax and have a nice conversation with her! the barbershop has a nice and clean facility perfect for enjoy a barber time!"
if you're looking for a barber that will make your dreams come true you have to go see mimi. mimi has been cutting my hair for the past 3 years. ive followed her to 3 different sport clips location as she is the only person allowed to touch my hair. i love mimi because she actually listens to you and will cut your hair the way you want it. unlike other barbers who say that they understand what you want and do the complete opposite. the staff that works with mimi are all so nice and friendly. a must go to get the right cut.
"ashley j was amazing. i had been getting my haircut at the same place for 15 years and needed a last minute haircut. that's how i found ashley. she was very professional, had great conversation and loved my haircut! i would recommend her to all my friends and family."
ever since i moved away from my hometown i've been struggling to find a good barber.. i've had some bad cuts from listening to peoples recommendations. it wasn't until i moved a few miles from this location that i finally came across mimi! you will not find anyone more friendly or skilled than her. i've seen her turnout some astounding transformations from her chair while waiting. to find anyone with this kind of talent is a life changing blessing!
i live about a block from here and usually go in to get a beard trim. they are fantastic at this location! i usually get a trim from mimi or karina. they are excellent! i could not be happier with the results!
"mimi was great! very skilled and kind! i will certainly return and recommend her to my friends. also, the online booking and queuing system is easy and convenient."
went there for the first time because i have gone to a sportsclips for years. love the steam towel and especially when they have the double steam towel/double shampoo is awesome. but my first experience with this one was terrible. i told her what to do with my hair and totally botched my haircut.... won't ever go back to this location but will go back to another and put a better review.
"i have been getting my hair cut by mimi for the past year or so at sport clips and i couldn't be happier. she does a fantastic job every time i go and it is obvious that she has many years of experience. i often get compliments from family, friends and colleagues, and to be honest that didn't happen until i started going to her. it has taken me a long time to find a good stylist so i hope she stays at this location!"
"new to the chicago/lincoln park area, and this was my first haircut with sports clips.  karina was absolutely amazing!  i showed her a picture of how i normally had my hair cut back in houston, and she exceeded my expectations!  she made me feel right at home and i cannot thank her enough.  her and her staff were very friendly and i will definitely be back to see karina and the rest of the staff soon!"
"i have been going to sport clips for a few years and i can't say enough great things.  i get a great haircut at a great price.  my stylist ashley is #1, she has a great personality, fun to chat with, and of course gives me a great style every time i come in.  the diversey location is very clean and professional looking.  i would highly recommend sport clips and ashley."
"karina (who was just promoted to manager) is amazing. i purposely come out of my way to get my haircut from her, along with my partner. i highly recommend her and staff, very professional, cut your hair exactly as you ask and extremely inviting! i will be back!"
"carina took care of my hair, was very professional and super nice! the facility was clean and staff was very helpful:)"
i used to live right around the corner and moved further away but i still make my way there to see karina! she's great and i highly recommend! i am always extremely happy with my cut!
"this place is great, everyone is so nice and friendly. i come here to get my hair and beard done and my wife loves it, she says i look like a real latin lover when i leave this place. karina really makes it easy for me, she always remembers my style and she nails it every time, she's the best."
mimi is the best. she knows how to give stylish cuts and maintain the health of the scalp. i recommend her at 5 stars!!!
"my best friend manages a salon in wicker park that i used to go to all the time, but living in lakeview, it's hard to get out there. i've tried many salons in the lakeview area and have left feeling not as confident, disappointed, fixing my hair once i get home, and even like i could have done a better job myself. i finally decided to give this sports clips location a try. why not? they were giving away a free cut for first time visitors when i went. ever since then, i haven't stopped going. it's been over a year now. this place is packed with talent!!! the staff is so kind, they listen, and they want you leaving happy. my favorite is karina. she really remembers you, what you like, what you talked about the last time you were there, and you can tell that she really enjoys what she does and will do anything to make her clients happy. you are the best, karina! but like i said, this place is full of talent from mimi to scarlet, and even when i leave the salon, i see great haircuts all around. use the online check-in so you don't have to wait so long!! just go online and do it that way. you won't regret it, especially since these talented stylists get busy! you could also put your name in and stop by a few other stores in the area. great location. hope you enjoy!!"
"nice spot for a haircut.  i was worried about going to a chain barber, but i was very pleased with the cut, the service and the facilities. i was happy with the attention and cut by drea. you cannot make an appointment, but you can check-in online. the website allows you to see the wait times, and you can check in for a particular stylist or for first available. then, when you arrive, you enter your phone number to check-in. the place has a sports theme. the seating area contains stadium seats; the tvs are showing sports channels; and the overall design of the place is closer to a sports bar than an old-time barber shop. (frankly, i'd prefer a little music to the tv audio, but most men would feel otherwise.) the first step is to go back to a darker room, sit in a massage chair, and get your hair washed while enjoying a hot towel treatment.  nice start! then it's back to the front for the cut. fine place for a good cut!"
"i recently moved to the city of chicago and had previously went to my same barber for the last 3 years... so choosing my next regular place to go was very important. i tried out a few of the downtown ""fancy"" salons and just couldn't find what i was looking for and someone skilled and genuine that i'd like to have style my hair weekly. i was lucky enough to be referred by a friend to ms drea here at sports clips river north! she is such a joy to see every week, always has a great upbeat energy, always engages in conversation, and puts the utmost detail and effort into my very specific cut i get. i suggest building the online profile and checking in online prior to heading over, they do get busy and it really helps to have your name on the list. sports slips offers a couple of service options from your basic men's cut ($20), the triple play ($25) get you the cut, massaging shampoo, and a steamed towel, then finally the mvp ($27) that gives you all of the above plus a head and shoulder massage. i personally do the basic cut every week to keep clean and then do the mvp once a month to ""treat myself"". drea is truly a skilled stylist, a genuine person, and has a great schedule that with week day availability! i would recommend her to anyone looking for that special treatment."
"need to get my hair cut for lollapalooza weekend. wasn't exactly sure what do i want. but, katie b. helped with my style exactly what i needed.  she was very patient and took her time to make sure it exceeded my expectations."
"holly was great! good cut, friendly staff, clean salon! short wait time, even on a friday afternoon! online check in is easy and nice. good price for the area. hot towel is a nice touch"
"6 people have cut my hair in the last 14 years and 2 of them only did it once. so i'm kinda picky. erin took great care of me, she's very consultative and professional. i appreciate that even when this place is super busy, everyone takes the time to greet customers and you don't feel like your stylist is trying to rush you to get to the next person. very well run and efficient and i've been very happy with my cuts since i started coming here."
"typical chain. when there was a specific manager there, she cared about the locals and regulars. the new staff does not care. long delays now and horrible customer service."
"blink and you will miss this location; it's tucked away at the top of some stairs on superior st downtown. i was travelling and in need of a haircut and i frequent a sports clips in s california. concept is the same and the staff can make or break it. got a great haircut by  emily,she was nice and chatty, all the staff seemed friendly  of what i could see- could go in the other direction if your an 'out of towner' though, didn't in my case. no frills, got what i needed in a small amount  of time."
drea was amazing. she takes her time and takes pride in her work. i highly recommend her!
"every new place i've gone to get my haircut, i've had anxiety from how difficult it is to explain my weird head shape (ridges on each side of my head that stick out) and how i'd like my hair cut and faded on the sides to mask these ridges. i scheduled an appointment with drea after reading many positive reviews on here, and before the hair cut i explained to her how particular i was about getting my hair cut to accommodate my head shape. she was great about listening to my concerns, offering her insight, and giving me a great haircut on my very first appointment! she is very sincere about wanting to give you the best cut possible, and she was especially patient with me during the first haircut, and spent a lot of time with me. and because she listened so carefully and took specific notes , the next haircuts i barely had to chime in at all, and she knew exactly how to give me the specific haircut i wanted!i have gone to other much more expensive salons since moving to chicago, and have had stylists literally tell me they couldn't cut my hair the way i wanted or that what i was asking was ""not possible"" with my head shape. these other stylists didn't seem to have any genuine care  and just wanted to get me in and out of the barber chair. with drea however, she listened, was very detailed, and gave me a great cut. i will be a repeat customer, and it's a relief to finally have found a stylist that can cut my hair the way i want!"
"2.5 stars would be the most accurate review of my experience. it wasn't all bad, more like slightly below average. i know you sometimes get what you pay for, but having been to several sports clips around the country, i knew what to expect. overall, my expectations of an average everyday haircut were not met. first, i was made to wait when i was the only patron and there were two barbers working. then, the notes that they had from a previous trip accurately described the haircut i wanted, but it was definitely not what i received. rather than blending the sides into the top, i now have a pseudo-mohawk. my neck wasn't touched leaving me work to do at home. and even though the notes stated that i usually get the mvp and the barber and i confirmed this, she told me i was done without the shampoo and massage. i know mistakes happen, but the packages are part of what sports clips markets themselves on.new to the area, i will be looking again for a new barber."
it's been a while since i've had such a great haircut and some really good customer service with a hairstylist that cares about your satisfaction. shoutout to drea for making this a great experience!
"i've been coming here for about a year and a half now. they always do a great job. special shout out to saundrea who has handled my hair cuts the last few times, and she knocks it out of the park. she pays attention to the little details and makes sure you're gonna look great! give her extra tips, and a raise!"
emily gave me a great haircut and shampoo today- looking forward to coming back soon!
"i have curly hair, and it's tough to find a barber that does a great job for me. i've been going to drea at sportclips for the past 2.5 years and am very happy with her haircuts!also, a great perk at sportclips, among others, is that they do free neck trims if you go back within 30 days of a haircut."
saunders is the bomb!! so much attention to detail and talent! i have never before received a cut where someone spent as much time as they did here.
wow wow wow i think i finally find my favorites haircut place ever!!!! use to go to sports clips in mt prospect illinois and it was above average however sandrea aka drea at the superior st location downtown is beyond relent at her profesion. she's amazing i take that back she's way beyond amazing i honestly have to admit this is my best haircut ever and after reading the other recommendations well worth it especially so convenient to where i live literally walking distance.sports clips definitely have earned a customer for life as long as drea is there .  thank you again and see you in about 10 days for hopefully another amazing haircut!!!  ps ask for drea and trust me you'll be amazed as well!!!
"i was surprised to see all of the rave reviews on here. yes, they do an alright job but my experience has been very variable. pros: martina, tina, and a few of the other girls do a good job, keep you looking fresh, can offer product suggestions without being pushy, and won't try to up sell you if just want a cut without the vip treatment.cons: i keep going mid afternoon during the week and having to wait for over an hour, they have three stylists working but the wait has been crazy lately. also, i did have a bad hair cut from one of the stylists- she was a smoker and smelled strongly of it plus left me with a dumb and dumber look that i was not a fan of. during my last trip the stylist also accidentally cut my neck- she apologized profusely and gave me a discount though so it wasn't the end of the world. the key with this place: get all of their discounts- they send out a lot and pick a good stylist like martina."
"i've been to this location a few times but more or less went there when i couldn't schedule a more ""high end"" stylist. my most recent visit i decided to schedule with the drea/sandrea considering all of her positive reviews on here. never have i ever had any hairstylist do so well particularly on the back. at first i was nervous with feeling how high she was taking the buzzer on my neck line.. when she showed me what it looked like i was kind of stunned. she fixed a bad situation i never really noticed before. i've paid ridiculous amounts for a so called ""high end"" haircut at pricy salons and at a mere $30 it was far and away the best cut i've ever had. i'll definitely be a regular for drea. she is a great stylist!"
"""appointment"" system is a nightmare. i work at an office about two blocks away. from the time it took to place and walk to the ""appointment"" my slot was already gone. i was told a barber was just finishing up and that i would be next, however, between the time that lie was given and her ringing up the client she was finished up with another person walked in and i was once again bumped. if you have time to kill in half-hour increments then i highly recommend this establishment. i won't pretend to know what rules they have to follow on their queueing system, it doesn't excuse telling someone that you're about to cut their hair and in the next breath say that it'll be another half hour."
"great sport clips, convenient location with great stylists. saundrea is the most talented stylist i've ever been to."
courtney is great! always get my haircut from her. $20 haircuts. depaul students also get free upgrade to mvp which includes free hair wash and hot towels
"i've been to this location on and off for about 4 years and my experience hit rock bottom at my last visit.  i can only trust one stylist at this establishment, but since it's just first come first serve, they will not allow you to request someone.  the most recent stylist i had ran clippers through my hair before asking me how i wanted it cut.  she made zero effort to provide any decent customer service and continued to talk to her coworker about how her ""brother didn't pick her to be his child's god-mother"" or how her ""friend didn't invite her to go on vacation.""  seriously?i will not be going here ever again."
"i received a haircut,back masssge, hot towel, and tea tree wash (v.i.p treatment)! jamea was very attentive to my needs and recommended products that would be best suitable for my hair. the atmosphere was very professional and my hair cut was perfect! price was also affordable. street parking is $2 for an hour."
"courtney was super quick to inform on the phone. she is really quiet and highly professional ..talks to the point on the phone.she was able to find a new product called ""shaver sahaperby wahl super close"" this takes off and you do not have to come home and shave again - this is amazing.she said this is a new product and i do have the picture of it...i believe this is sold through sallys beauty care or so.anyhow for the first time, she did an excellent job. i am totally new to this place in chicago, il.. normally i go to altamonte springs florida sport clips only:)she was kind enough to give some coupon on return visit and if i refer alsoher name was courtney in lincoln park, chicago , il 60614"
"i received the worst haircut of my life at sport clips recently. my barber was unavailable and i took the risk of going to the first available place, which turned out to be a horrible experience.i can compare it to being on a rollercoaster and wanting to get off near the top, but not being able to because you are already locked in your seat.the girl cutting my hair was worse than a used car salesman, attempting to up sell me on the ""tea tree lotion"", "" the mvp upgrade"", ""the hair products"". i just wanted a haircut, not to be badgered into buying stuff i didn't need or want.she shaved the hairline up so far on my neck that i sat there in awe when she showed me in the mirror. i was contemplating shaving my whole head since the haircut passed the point of no return. the simple instructions i provided turned into the most misinterpreted hair cut i ever had.getting a bad haircut is one of the worst fears i have and it was like nightmare on elm street in sports clips."
"first time to this location so courtney upgraded to the mvp i believe for free. very satisfied with my cut, very professional and she was pretty fun to talk to. if i'm ever in chicago i'll definitely be back hopefully she will still be there. she sis a great job. thanks."
"thought it was great.  went in on a coupon and decided to get the mvp.  hannah i think was my stylist and she couldn't have been nicer.  gave me the dog and pony show just like everywhere else and wasn't pushy.  dug the whole thing and don't know why i need to spend $60 for someone else.  actually bought the whatever pack for 6 haircuts.  its easy, close an they have on espn the whole time."
worst place. i never review. but i just don't understand the mentality here. there was 3 customers waiting and 3 stylist. i understand they have to clean their stations but they were no where in sight. they were fooling around outside probably smoking while we wait. that's bullshit.  you take care of the customers then dick around if you want. i arrived there at about 530 and didn't leave until around 645 with 3 people ahead of me and 3 stylist. you do the math. one of girls didn't even come back in until i was finished. i had to get up and say something to one of the stylist if they can cut my hair now. she knows it was wrong cause she didn't argue w me  all around bullshit service never go back
"the girls here always do a nice job and i really enjoy the mvp service. my main gripe about this place is that they really need to have a full time person at the front desk. any time people walk in or the phone rings, the stylists have to leave their clients in the chair to attend to it. this really seems disrespectful to the person getting their hair cut and i'm sure it keeps the stylists from doing their best as well.i'm a very patient person so i have always just dealt with it. however if they don't change that soon i might go elsewhere to get my hair cut."
"echoing the review below about this being the worst hair cut experience i've ever had. maybe this is what i get for going to a place with a tacky sports theme. as a first time (oh, and last time) customer i was given a complimentary upgrade to the ""mvp,"" which by my description below should really worry you if you just go with the basic option.first of all, i had simple needs. #2 buzz cut, maybe a brief shampoo scalp massage kind of thing, but generally i'm not picky. this girl was running the clippers like she was trying to scalp me. i actually winced from that a couple times. i think i had the same stylist as matt m. who describes her grinding the clippers into his scalp. she was going so fast i would have thought there was a huge line out front - except i was the only person there. 10 seconds of shampooing and her elbowing a warm towel into my face and she was done. so that's the mvp. nevermind the sign that references about 3 other steps and emphasizes how relaxing it is. not here."
"to put it simply, this is a great place to get a very inexpensive, solid haircut in chicago. if you go with the season pass, you basically get 6 haircut/shampoo/hot towel/massage for $17 a piece. i'll admit that the massage is pretty worthless. they use one of those hand-massage/vibrator things that you can get from sharper image for $10...maybe even get one on sale from skymall.i used to go to swerve in old town, received the same haircut, no hot towel or ""meh"" massage and i paid $70. sure, i was offered coffee/tea/beer/wine before my haircut...but i can also pound a pbr before heading to sportclips and get the same experience. i don't need to spend an extra $50.i've had a number of different stylists over the past 2-3 years and i've not once had a bad haircut. i'm not very picky myself, nor am i naive, so i am sure other people have had a particular experience in which a stylist did not adhere to their particular tastes...but i have no complaints here.if you're a regular dude in chicago looking for a solid, well-priced haircut, you can't go wrong here."
"i'm in the military and have a string of different regulations that my hair must conform to.  if not, i have eight different bosses who go out of their way to yell at me as to why it isn't.  this is why you see so many people with a buzz cut in the service...it is sooo much easier to get it right by cutting it all off than trying.   i drive an hour each way to get my hair cut because these girls get it right every time.  of course i have my favorite stylist, but when she isn't there i don't have to worry.   every single one of them has, and will, cut my hair exactly how i want it.   they're also a team of perfectionists, and won't let me walk out the door without it being exactly right.  i don't think you'd find a team of equally talented ladies anywhere else in the city.  they're all funny, welcoming and personable, and the best at what they do!"
"formerly down the street from where i lived, sportclips was a convenient place, even if they were overpriced and would under-deliver.  out of their many stylists, only a few actually know what they're doing; it shouldn't be that difficult for male hairstyles.  if i'm going to get a bad haircut where the stylist grinds the clippers into my scalp or blatantly ignores my description for my desired style, i might as well just go down a block to supercuts or whatever it's called (or even worse, doesn't know what i'm talking about) .i would say to specifically avoid tyler, and i wish that i remembered the other stylists who are terrible.  now that it's no longer convenient, i'm definitely not going back."
"went and got a free hair cut here with a coupon, it was alright. this place definitely has a great clips business model [in and out quick for a cheap price] they give you a free back massage and scalp massage but i ended up with a weird headache from all the crap they stuck in my hair. you get to watch sportscenter while getting your hair cut, which is cool but it turns weird and makes the haircut process more awkward [i feel weird making conversation with hair stylist, never can figure out why] but at least you now have an excuse to zone out while the cut is going on. i got a buzz [a 1] and they still shampooed my hair which was odd, but i guessin all it was pretty good for a free hair cut, i probably wont go again if i have to pay but if you find  a coupon go, they are nice enough people and give decent haircuts."
"if you're looking for a reasonably priced haircut, enjoy the company of cute and friendly girls, and like to watch sports, this place is for you.  i recommend the mvp.  if you're a salon snob this place is obviously not for you.  i don't understand why some of the other reviewers would walk into a place called sport clips expecting a snooty salon.  they must be simple, illiterate, or both."
"i have gotten three haircuts here now. the first two were above average, but this last one was terrible. she basically cut a bald spot into my head and now i find myself wearing a hat more often than not...thankfully its winter and it isn't weird looking.i wish i could remember her name to tell you not to use her, but i don't. fortunately for me, i remember her face and will ask to not have her cut my hair again.also, as an added bonus, you can take your receipt next door to uncle sammy's and get 50% your order."
"a lot of people have been waiting for this review. brace yourselves for the tale of how a night of drinking and bears football led to the worst cut of my life.i'm the son of a hair stylist. i grew up in a cosmetology school and spent years in salons. i can smell perm solution a mile away. i know how to perform colors, cuts and could probably to extensions if i needed to.when i left arizona, i had my first cut from someone other than my mother. i was lucky to find heather anderson, who kept me beautiful for years.upon moving to chicago, i linked up with allison at strange beauty show. again, fortune smiled upon me, and the streets of chicago were a little more beautiful with my coiffure prancing along them.in my entire life, i had never visited a stylist in anything other than a high-end, fashionable salon.then came a trip to lion head pub. during the bears vs vikings game, a pair of women started working the crowd in racy referee outfits. shot girls? strippers? referees?nope. they were hair stylists promoting sport clips, a salon that prides itself on less chit-chat and more tv. they offered me a coupon for the ""mvp treatment"": a haircut, steamed towel, shampoo and shoulder massage. for the sake of yelp and against my better judgment, i vowed to visit.as a man, i'm a bit offended by the sport clips concept. i'm not a 5-year-old. i actually enjoy talking with my stylist and discussing hair, style, salon goings-on and our personal lives. i don't need different rooms of the salon to have cutesy names. i don't need a remote control on my seat.sport clips doesn't take appointments. i'm told that's because men prefer to just walk in. i don't. i like to know my stylist will be ready when i'm ready. i schedule my next cut at the end of each salon visit. i own a day planner.so i arrive and wait 15 minutes for a stylist. while waiting, i'm left to watch college basketball with a bunch of kids. the plus side is most of the stylists are cute, and they all seem pretty cool, like punk rockers who just needed salon jobs.i was assigned to lauren, who is both cute and cool, and we discussed what i wanted done with my hair. lauren and i got along just fine and had a lot in common, so i got comfortable.then she sprayed a few squirts of water on my hair and got going ... with a straight razor ... on the back.i've been getting razor cuts for years, and i've never had anyone take a razor to the back of my head or start cutting without a shampoo. i decided to let her do her thing. maybe she knew something i didn't.while giving me a cut, lauren started talking about the different paul mitchell products she was using. i know what working on commission is like for a stylist. i know how much selling product helps the bank account. but i am an bumble & bumble addict, and i refuse to try anything else. after lauren did some bizarre thinning and texturing with scissor up top (and didn't use the razor there), she took me into a dark room for my shampoo and steam towel.as my eyes adjusted and i settled into the shampoo bowl, i noticed a giant fat head looming on the wall next to me.it couldn't be. no way. blue jersey, orange numbers, pale skin ...brian urlacher?yes, a life-sized brian urlacher in a tackling pose really is going to help me relax. mmmmmm.ok, here's the only part i enjoyed (other than meeting some nice stylists): the scalp massage and shampoo weren't the best i've had, but they were decent. the steam towel absolutely kicked nut. i felt refreshed and relaxed and cool. lauren applied a little pressure to my face, and i was in heaven.apparently, so was the guy sitting a few seats away. he started making slight moaning noises. maybe he was really into urlacher.lauren took me into the main room, which blinded me with bright lights. that would explain why i didn't notice that my hairline was too long, my backside was too bulky and my sideburns were cut too narrow. ""ready for your massage?""she should have asked ""ready to be jabbed in the back with a vibrator?"" because that's what she did. after about 30 seconds of vibration, i felt violently nauseous.in the end, i tipped $10 and gave lauren a free pass to the bravery. the salon isn't her fault. it's just a horrible business idea: take everything good about a salon and reverse it.as i was waiting outside for the bus, i noticed my head was still wet, which quickly turned to ice. thank goodness for my flask of bourbon and the cta.lauren, if you're reading this, i'm sorry. you're sweet, and i'm sure you do standard cuts very well. i'm just a salon snob, and i probably over-instructed you on your first cut with me."
visited there in 2008. it was the worst haircut i have received to date.
"dude the season ticket package rocks, you get 6 mvp haircuts for the price of 6 regular haircuts. they never expire so it's a great deal at $17 for a haircut that includes warm towel, this back massage thingymajjiger, massaging shampoo, the works!the staff is very friendly as well, not the fake friendly but the real friendly. they hire down to earth people.i had to subtract 1 star though because i brought in a photo of an old haircut and tried to get the same but it ended up being a generic short hair haircut which is fine. this place, like every other non-asian haircut place i go to loves to lop off my hair completely despite my wishes. it's ok though, if you want to cut off all my hair and leave none it just means i only need a haircut every 2-3 mths instead of every month.from a peer business perspective i don't know why these cutters don't err on the side of too-long rather than always making my hair too short. oh well, almost a 5 star, almost a 5 star."
"i had wandered far and wide, across the yuppie lakeview and back through the land of over privileged college kids who think they are too smart to vote (lincoln park) and finally found sportsclips. i promptly performed my devotion to the gods of good fortune and clean-cut grooming and entered the establishment. lucky for me, i didnt need an appointment.i had walked past this place many times before and wrote it off simply because i believed that since i was in chicago, i could find a nice local barber who would charge me less and do a better job than at a franchised salon like sportsclips. the pricing was a little intimidating at first, but i needed a trim so i was ready to pay up. i was met by a friendly stylist within the 1st 10 minutes and all i had to was say ""im going to a party of my boss's and i look like a hippie, please help me"" and i got a great haircut just like that, i never get it that easy at a barbershop. she also upgraded me to their top package (cut, shampoo, hot towel, massage) for no extra charge which was nice. i walked out looking and feeling good with a card of coupons giving me cash discounts for my next 5 visits. good hair cuttery for any guy who needs a simple, professional looking haircut."
"finally the staff were professional, friendly, and amazing. especially hedit i took in my son for his first haircut and she was patient and sweet she the real mvp."
"i'm not surprised to see a low rating for this location. sports clips is where i've been getting my hair cut for a decade now.sarah was my stylist, and sarah does not like to adhere to the slogan, ""the customer is always right."" and when you're cutting people's hair, that's really something you need to believe in.why i want my hair shampooed first is irrelevant. again, for the past 10 years this has never been an issue for me. i've had fabulous experiences at other sport clips locations. she did not want to do that, and insisted on explaining to me why it was a bad idea. when i told her i'd like it before, she gave me the shampoo. however, she didn't offer me the steam towel, or scalp massage, even though she charged me for the triple play. when i asked why i didn't receive it, she said, ""because we normally do that at the end."" very petty, and unprofessional.i've only ever had two bad experiences at a sport clips, and this was definitely one of them. i do not recommend."
"i've been going to myra g. for my haircuts since 2004. she's professional, friendly and courteous. i've even changed locations with her when she moved from knox st. to greenville ave. location. i'll be back!"
the cut was decent and they provide you with discount coupons for future visits. though the lowest cut costs $23 which was including shampoo
literally download the app and made a brand new yelp just to post this horrible rating. if you want a hair cut in a timely matter than i would not recommend sport clips. only had one person working at 2:30 in the afternoon and insisted it would atleast a 30 min wait period. on a thursday. that is ridiculous. it was only me and one other gentleman waiting. we both left. terrible job and another lady left as i walked in. yal need more dedicated workers. sorry
i most certainly would not recommend this place had the worst experience yesterday evening as i walked in a older black lady decided to cut my hair . i asked her if there was still time   horrible decision she cut my hair in less ten minutes then  didn't want to wash it   not to mention that blending absolutely horrible guys i don't recommend this place i had decided to give it another chance a few months ago i had this young girl cut my hair of course it was not what i wanted so if you go get your haircut run away from this lady black older lady she has horrible customer skills not good at doing haircuts i don't know why they hire these people they deserve no stars ..  fyi  this not my name
"wish i could give 0 stars to this place. terribly rude and incompetent staff.  maria is a nightmare, screaming at kids and their parents because she can't handle children's haircuts.  never waste your time or money here."
i use to love coming to sports clips but since i've moved away from my normal sports clips the service has really gone down. i've come to this location a few times and the service was okay. it seams no matter what time i come they are always short a barber or the wait time is over an hour. if i didn't live so far from my original sports clips i went to i would never come. sports clips you've lost a long time customer!!!!!!!' looks like it's time to find a new place for a haircut.
"so it's not a bad deal if you can get them to use your coupon. first timers get the vip for the price of a regular hair cut which clearly says 15 on the the wall but they tell you 21. before i got to use my first timer discount i asked about the yelp coupon which they had no idea what it was on the yelp app. service was great fast and easy. there was a long wait i understand because what they were offering cut, wash, message. don't know if i would go back tho."
after reading the reviews i am glad they wouldn't cut my hair.  i walk in at 7:55 pm and they say they are closed. they are on a different time than the rest of the world. google and at&t say they are open. i asked for the manager and i get a rude women saying they are closed and they are not cutting anymore hair.  poor customer service!!!!!
we've been waiting for over an hour for a cut. they're more concerned about cleaning the facility so they can leave than taking care of the customers who have been here for the last hour. we're watching them clean as we continue to wait.poor customer service.
yesterday i was having a not so chill day. just another day full of errands and getting my hair cut was one of those errands. to be honest i actually did not like sports clips at all. every time i have gone in the employees never seem too excited to cut hair. there have been times when i feel kind of reluctant to ask for the shampoo service because it seemed as though my stylist didn't want to cut my hair let alone wash it. honestly if they didn't want to do it i didn't want to make them do it. but yesterday was different. jennifer took care of me yesterday before i had to rush into work. she was outstanding. i went in for a simple hair cut and to me i thought my hair cut was just an easy one. even though the style was simple she still didn't rush me and she still paid attention to detail. also she didn't have an attitude and was very welcoming. she's a hard worker in my opinion and i will for sure come and see her every time if i can.
this sport clips is pretty much like any other. it's a good idea with some good hair stylists and some not so good hair stylists.i personally have only had one poor experience and that was at different location. i have been to this one around 8 or so times so i honestly only have positive thoughts towards it!first edit:ask for mindy. easily my favorite stylist. and personally i think the best.~carpe diem~
horrifying this people have no idea how to cut hair shaved my boyfriend bold when we clearly told them how to cut and show the picture. 20$ of horror please save another 20$ and go to boarsroom for cut.amen
"great location, great team and great experience.  the crew was is friendly and thoughtful."
"$19 + tip is a bit much for as simple buzz cut without the ""vip service"". floyd's, a higher end place, is cheaper."
should have looked at yelp first. so disappointed.i asked for a very simple haircut and the first time i came here in late september the lady was pretty good added some notes to my account so i was excited for the follow-up to hopefully get a nice cut. i never go to these chain places but i'm new to the area and haven't found a nice barbershop yet.when i came in today the lady sat me down i told her give me a 3 on the sides blended to shorter hair on top. i showed her do not go any higher than this part of my head or it will look bad. she said that's what the notes say no problem. after she starts off it went well and was looking good. she asked me how it looked i said perfect don't go any higher. she says ok and after cleaning up my neck she then decides to shave up the side of my head way too high now i have a fo-hawk. when i told her to fix it she said that's what i asked for. she washed my head and when i looked in the mirror i was horrified i walk to the counter said she messed up my hair. the lady said that's what i asked for and the girl at the counter still charged me $14 which was half off. i went and purchased clippers at wal-mart for $24 so hopefully i'll be able to salvage my hair. feel free to contact me and i'll cut anyone's hair for $5 in the north dallas addison area and save you the money and guarantee it to look better than this rip-off joint
"love the place and the ability to watch sports while getting a haircut is a plus.  the only thing keeping it from 5 starts is the randomness of who you get to cut your hair and the levels of service you get are different.  however, overall i give it 4 out of 5 and still recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice easy cut."
best hair cut ever love the staff very clean shop.we have been coming to this location for a long time and will continue.
if you get the girl with plastic surgery walk out the door. she does it in 2 minutes and does a horrible job.
"i've been going to sportclips for about 5 years.  i don't have a specific person i use every time meaning no matter who cuts my hair, they do a good job.  and the triple play is a great deal.  cut, hot towel, shampoo and head massage for $22."
"i have taken my teenage son to this location twice and both times, he has walked out with bad haircuts.  once it was uneven around the ears (by a full inch!) and the other time - when we revisited with the free haircut coupon they gave as an apology - it was crooked in the back at the neckline.  if you get your hair cut here, i highly recommend really checking it out in the mirror before leaving.  the people who ""fix"" bad haircuts do a great job but it's a hassle having to have his hair cut twice because the first person can't cut hair."
great job today! new online booking system is active now (i was first customer) and i was in and out within 15 mins today. awesome job. i'll be back
"i usually go to barber shops because of results like this but this specifically was an all time low. i came in and everyone was friendly. to be honest, i'm sure everyone else there could've cut better. however, i got an asian lady who doesn't know anything. as former military, i have always asked for a ""high and tight"". i said this and i've never looked more confused. that was my first bad sign. i then proceeded to explain what that was, (i still can't get over how someone who cuts hair doesn't get that), and she did literally that. my top was 1.5 and my sides were 0. no blending. i had to ask for her to fix it. i don't get it. also, the clippers were pulling my hair the entire time. any good barber knows when it is but she continues carelessly. i mentioned it to her and she looked confused and just sprayed cleaner on the clippers. she then continued to cut my hair even as it pulled more. i swear i doubt she even has a license to cut hair. i then also had to ask for her to make my sides shorter since a high and tight is clean. so she then pushed the clippers into my head more try to dig my hair out so it would be closer.... even though she could've just taken off the clip or used the shaver sitting right in front of her. to summarize, she didn't know how to cut hair at all and i doubt she is even licensed to. i don't mind that she barely knew english but i do mind that she doesn't know how to do her job. worst experience and haircut ever received. it's unfortunate considering i work in coppell and talk to hundreds of people ever week. i will make it my prerogative to warn everyone about this horrible spot. shaking my head."
"after i walked in to a nearly empty place, i was rushed into the chair. the woman cutting my hair was clearly trying to get me out of there. i went to sports clips for the mvp, and had to request one, she never offered, which i just thought was a little weird. the whole thing was super rushed, and the haircut was just ok. the back of my neck still stings 45 minutes later, as well. i definitely recommend trying another barber in the area."
"if you are looking for a good, basic haircut at a somewhat reasonable price, this place will do.  the friendliness of the staff varies, depending upon who you get.  there is a fair amount of turnover as well, so if you don't like the staff this week, try again in a few weeks."
no customer service. bad attitude. looks like stylists are not looking forward to having customers.donot recommend this location.
"rude rude rude!!!! i walked out, i don't understand how they employ people with sour attitudes. i walked in, smiled and said hello. i was greeted with a ""have you been here before"" as if i was wasting her time. they need to hire a new staff!!"
decent haircut but way too pricey at $20 for a standard cut without the frills or even a wash.
i got a great haircut and not to mention 1st time visitors get a free hair wash and neck and shoulder message!
"one of the best locations in area.  pricey haircuts, but worth it."
"i've been to several sports clips, and this must have been the few times i didn't feel welcome. it could be that the only thing on tv was duke vs uconn.. women's basketball, and perhaps i wasn't in the talking mood after eating a ridiculous amount of garlic.. but it was a quick haircut which i needed since i'm hardpressed for time as a full-time student (wow that was a run-on sentence). also, not really thrilled they wouldn't take my $5 coupon although i will admit that it was from another store, but i've been to other stores where they have. sucks because i probably won't go back even though this is the closest location to me because i don't feel like paying so much for a haircut which the stylist said i should come in once every two weeks for (i understand it is her livelihood though). therefore, if you like pricey but quick haircuts and hopefully the stylist will be in a better mood (didn't even tell me her name), this is a decent place to get hair cut and not miss any sports action.otherwise, keep the fro a little more and wait for a competitor's coupon like me!"
"i've been coming to this sports clips for the better part of a year now, and i just went in today for maybe the 5th time. first, this location has recently been renovated. 4 large flat-screen hdtvs with sportscenter or a live game on constantly ensure that no matter which way you are pointed during your haircut, you'll have a good viewing angle. the back room where your hair is washed and/or hot towel is applied is dark, comfortable and relaxing. stylists are friendly, although the woman who appears to be the manager of this location can be a little brash at times. sometimes you need to keep your interoffice ""talk"" to yourself or wait until there are no customers around to hear it. this alone is the main reason i cannot give this sports clips a 5 star rating.now, for the actual haircut:i am pleased with the consistency of the haircuts i have been getting. i have been going with a david beckham style cut, and they do an excellent job. i have been to a different stylist each time, and i have not had a bad experience yet. a hint to men: if you want your hair to look like someone or is a specific style, bring in a photo or save one to your phone and show it to your stylist...this is a secret women have kept for years, and i think if men just told their stylist exactly how they wanted it, some of these complaints would not occur.additionally:this was the first time i tried the mvp treatment (scalp massage, tea tree treatment, shoulder and neck massage, hot towel along with the haircut) and i was pleasantly surprised. i had passed on previous visits because it just seemed like an up-charge, but decided to give it whirl this time. it is well worth what some may think is a steep cost ($24), and considering that is what some people will pay for a large pizza that lasts all of 30 minutes, i think it is a justified cost.no, it's not a high-end salon, but it also doesn't charge the $60 that a high-end salon would...so there it is.i will be returning for another cut in a few weeks.  i recommend this place for men and boys...obviously, i can't speak to women getting their hair done here, but sports clips caters to men, so i would not recommend women try it, unless you want the latest miley cyrus look..."
"do not ever fall for the ""we are not busy, you will get right in.""  arrive and get 30 min wait. too much yapping and not enough clipping.   go somewhere"
"came from san diego, ca where the barbers are some of the best in the world. shopped around barbers here in dallas and either it's over priced or all hype. came to sports clips for my two sons and kayla hooked them up. both of my sons hair was better than mine. i've been having her cut all of our hair since. about a year now and i recommend everyone to kayla. it's definitely not a typical sports clips cut."
stopped in today to get a haircut with no particular stylist in mind and guess as luck would have it i got jessica.  jessica did an amazing job and was super friendly.  i highly recommend her great personality and great job!
"long time user of this place, reasonably priced haircuts fast. i took my sons there all through high school. i felt compelled to leave a rating now because of their new payment system. i'm old and bald. i have very little hair. my haircut takes literally 5 minutes with a #2 and costs $16. reasonable. what set me off is that their new payment system puts a ""minimum"" tip on my transaction of $5. on a $16 haircut? 31%? sure, i can change it. i have to select ""other"", then type in a new amount, click ok, all while the girl that just cut my hair watches me change the amount knowing full well what the minimum is. i just want to pay quickly and leave. not sure i think a 30% tip is ok when pretty much anybody with a steady hand could cut my hair, the hardest part is cleaning up my neck and around my ears.i'll be looking elsewhere, sadly."
"we have taken my three year old son multiple places trying to get a decent, well-done haircut. we finally found it at sport clips!! he enjoyed watching the tv while getting his haircut. the stylist did a very good job of trimming around his ears and neck, which are often neglected in kids haircuts. also, he got a sucker and a ball, so he's already asking to go back!! this is one happy momma!"
kayla cut my 15 year old son's hair today.  we walked right in - no waiting!  she did a great job and was personable.  went here on a recommendation and will be going back.
we've loved this location! i bring both my boys here for haircuts and we love alana!! she always does a great job and is very detailed. highly recommend her!
the girls are nice but can't really cut hair the way they are supposed to..i had a simple hair cut but she couldn't really tapper up properly.
unlike everyone else... the girls are awesome they always do a great job on my hair and i will always be back.
"i drive all the way over here for fort worth every three weeks just to get a hair cut from jessica. i stumbled in here around a year ago refuse to go anywhere else or let anyone else cut my hair. im a 33 year old veteran and cant ever remember getting a better hair cut from anyone else. after taking my stepson to several places in fort worth and them ruining his hair we no longer get his haircut from anyone else, but jessica. its always been clean and the people are always so nice. come here, see jessica and im pretty sure you wont be disappointed, especially if you're super picky with your hair like me."
"just don't go here!asked for a simple hair cut and the lady messed it up. had a long cut on the back my neck, thanks to the horrible trimmer."
i have been going here for years and the customer service is great! jessica is the one always cutting my hair and she does an awesome job!
"the worst haircut of my life! she was finished in 3 minutes, rushing to help next customer.  i asked the lady to point cut my hair because i have curly hair and straight lines show. she didn't do anything i asked, the manager got all defensive and states she would have done it even faster, & that they don't normally do point cut with scissors and she's been cutting hair for 8 years. whoopidiedooo, every customer is different and should be treated special and giving te service they want and deserve, i felt like cattle getting a shot and then kicked in the butt telling me to get!"
"i have been to this place no less than 10 times. the only reason i keep going is that it is so convenient for me, since i work right across the street. i finally had to call it quits yesterday. i thought i had finally found one lady there who gives a half decent haircut. i get home, and realize that she forgot to cut about 1/4 of my hair towards the front. now i have hair the length of about a #5 for most of my head, and my hair is the original length in the front. i can assure you it looks ridiculous.the ladies that work here are the nicest women you will ever meet, they just have no idea how to give a thorough haircut. i've had issues from one girl trimming the area + 1/2 inch behind my ears, to various stylists leaving one area of my hair longer, to a stylist forgetting to blend the sides into the top. i have no problem when my hairstylist wants to strike up a conversation with another stylist, but when the quality of the product they produce is so crappy, it gets frustrating. along with the other review on here, i do always feel rushed. it feels like they know they are making mistakes, and want to cover them up by making you leave. fortunately for them, there are no other establishments that are close with their hours."
"most i've ever paid for a haircut ($17 pre-tip, i got the lowest-priced one), and it wasn't worth it. while i always get a very simple cut, it felt like i was being rushed out of there. the whole thing took less than five minutes and she didn't do a very thorough job on my sideburns or removing excess hair. i was one of only two people there, so you'd think i might be treated better.also, website mentions free upgrade for first-time sports clips visitors, but i wasn't offered any, despite them knowing it was my first time.i'll take the $5 special at my local shop next time, thank you very much."
worst haircut of my life. stay away from this place unless you want to look like a clown. they hire young girls with no clue on how to cut hair. butchered my hair with uneven side burn. next time i would prefer to cut my own hair than visit this rip off spot.
"okay - you've heard from the rest - now hear from the best, lol. no, seriously though, i have been going to this location for 3 years. the first time i ever stepped foot in the joint i came with my brother. he went first and it was like the other guys said - a fast quick hair cut that did not look like anything extra special - but it didn't look bad either - it was a hair cut - which we came for - surprised right?  - don't figure.  next i was up, she took about 20 minutes cutting my hair and complimenting me about how thick and soft my hair was. she may have even fondled my head a bit, which felt good. when she was all done it looked like a nice cut. it's funny cause when we left my brother said       "" i'm not coming back here again, she only spent 5 minutes on my hair and she spent 20 minutes on yours ! ""       the fact that neither one of us had a better quality cut then the other did not even matter to him - it was just that she was with me longer. i chose to go back and have had my hair cut several times since then. sometimes my hair gets cut quicker, and sometimes it takes longer. i think it just depends on who is cutting, and what is on the girls mind when she is cutting. anyway, if you are a guy that likes chics ( which i really do, lol ) then come here and you should be pleased. they have flat screen high def tv's with sports channels always on and a sports theme. they also do massage and neck rubs which feel really great. i honestly can't remember ever having a bad experience here, or at any of the other locations either. true, the price is a little higher than other places - but - if you can't afford the price go to great clips and leave these sports clips girls for me !!"
"the girl was pleasant but she scratched the back of my neck badly!  i have big red scratches on my neck.  i have an easy buzz cut, didn't even have to use scissors and it was still $17.  definitely not worth it.  if you're a man, go to a proper barber.  these types of places are a sham."
"i have been a sport clips customer for more than 4 years.  i have not had a bad experience at any location and i have been to several in multiple states.  i have been to multiple locations in the lakewood and uptown areas and i love this branch.  although the parking can be a bit of s pain, i have never had a problem with any of the stylists. my favorite is april and over the years she has cut my hair the most.  she is always friendly and does a great job. i will keep coming here and keep recommending them to my friends"
"had a horrible haircut experience here. been a few times but 3rd time was my last. the experience left me scared, literally. posted pictures. beware of the cheetah taped clippers."
go get a cut here if you want the most wack cut bruh. overpriced and no skill or talents needed whatsoever to get a job here. the wait and price do not match the quality of the haircut. i could get my mom to cut my hair for free and still have better quality than this. i could even cut my own hair by myself and it would still be better than y'all and save money and live better (walmart). if i could put my hair back and get a refund i would do that and use that money to get it cut somewhere else. definitely going back to the barbers back in garland that only charge around $5 and actually give you your money's worth.
"love this place. april does a great job managing this location, and she gives great hair cuts. not sure why there are so many negative reviews on here. been coming here for over 5 years and i have always had a good experience."
"although the hairstylists come and go, they seem to recruit good ones. this store can get kind of busy, so don't worry, because they have sports playing on every tv. april does a great job managing the place and correcting any mistake."
"this sports clips has the worst owner/management.  if you come to get a haircut in june/july/august, prepare to bake in the waiting area.  the sunlight will scorch your skin because management is too cheap to apply tint or blinds to make waiting customers comfortable.  i have made multiple suggestions and filled out comment cards, but to no avail.  supercuts on lemon is not far from this location and guess what?  they treat customers like customers...not like uncooked cookie dough.  tip for management:  adding tint or blinds will decrease your energy costs as well as minimize these harmful social media critiques.sincerely,baked cookie"
"pretty terrible choice to get a haircut at this place. i had previously never been to a sport clips before, and after the haircut i received, i will never visit one again. i was in on friday to get a pretty easy haircut, clippers on the sides and faded towards the top, super easy, i thought. the girl cutting my hair didn't seem to have a clue, i unfortunately noticed this too late. my hair is completely crooked and i actuall had to go to super cuts, to get it fixed. how crappy is that, supercuts is a step up from this place, and about $7 cheaper. this place already has bad reviews and i should've listened. believe me, all the bad reviews are accurate. skip this place. i'm fairly certain this is the type of place that probably doesn't give a shit about reviews, but you guys ate in big trouble if you can't even pull off my simple haircut. pathetic."
"wow. don't even know where to begin. this is the worst place to get a hair cut. i told the lady to give me a 2 on the side, blend it in and trim the top. she have me a 1 on the side, no blending and a slight trim on the top. my hair looks like dumb and dumber. i could not believe my eyes. she started in the back of my head so i couldn't see what she was doing, be the time she got to the side, i immediately asked her wtf she was doing?... do not go here. i have been to millions of sports clips and this place is the worst haircut i've ever received in my life. i look like i'm going to be in a ufc fight or punk rock band. incredible, i had to go to floyd's 99 barbershop to get my hair fixed. listen to the other reviews, do not go here!!"
i followed april over from another sport clips location she's the best in dallas. she cuts my daughter's hair too & is great with little kids.
"this was the worst experience i've ever had!! even worse than the time i was a young child and my barber accidentally clipped my ear. the person that cut my hair was in a bad mood. she was snappy and very unfriendly. i never go to places such as great clips, supercuts, knockouts or sports clips. i was in desperation mode due to my regular stylist being out of town and my backup barber was out for lunch. i have a head full of hair and was looking to get cleaned up around the edges, sideburns trimmed, etc. well i sat in the chair and within 10 minutes the person cutting my hair said she was finished. at that point i just wanted to get out of there so i paid and left. i have been inactive from yelp for almost 3 years and this experience caused me to say something about it in order for others to be spared. don't do it! let your kids cut your hair instead. they'll do a better job."
update - this place has pulled off a 180 and now i am a frequent customer.  they hired a new manager april who is awesome and cuts my hair very well. all the staff are friendly but i cannot speak to how they cut hair since i request april every time i go in. amazing how the right person can make a world of difference.
website says they open at 9:00am.  they changed to open at 10:00 am and did not update the website! thanks for the wasted hour!
i've been to this location three times since i moved to the area. each time has gotten worse. i can agree with other reviewers' comments in saying the people who work there are friendly but that's where i'll stop. needless to say i'll be trying another sportsclips for my next haircut.
"i wouldn't go here again.$20 for a mens trim, scalp massage, and back massagethe scalp massage is them putting conditioner in your hair, the back massage consists of them holding a plastic massage toy to your back for about 10 seconds.not happy with the hair cut either."
"the stylist was so timid with the clippers, she ended up just butchering my fade.  she then had to ask the other stylist who was working ""how to blend a fade"".  what?!  apparently she was sick or skipped class that day they taught how to blend.  i asked for a trim on top, and she ended up cutting maybe a millimeter off the top.  i pointed out mistakes in my haircut and she kept trying to ""fix"" the problem.  i finally told her to stop before my hair was not repairable (going to have to go pay another barber shop to fix this joint's mistakes).  i got the mvp (cut, massage shampoo, hot steam towel, and shoulder massage).  the hot towel was more a little less than luke warm.  when she was done with the shampoo and asked if i wanted any product, i said no i'll just put my cap back on.  she said, okay we are done then....with my hair still dripping wet.  she never offered or did dry my head.  on top of that, she didn't do the shoulder massage.  and at the end still had the nerve to charge me full price ($23) for my horrible haircut experience...and the girl knew she had done a very poor job!!  avoid this location!!!!"
"my wife was helping to give me a no-frills buzz cut when my clippers crapped out. i went down the road to sport clips to let them finish the job. after finishing the buzz cut, they had the nerve to charge me $19. apparently they have a standardized pricing system- what a rip off. when i got home, my wife noticed they had left a couple patches of long hair strands in some not so inconspicuous places. they have really improved my overall feelings toward supercuts. i will never go here again."
"my husband and son go here once a month or so.  the staff is always very friendly and accommodates my 2 year old son.  i would say the cuts are good, not great, but definitely worth the moderate price.  for people looking for high-end cuts, this may not be your place, but for a quick, friendly, good cut, the staff here gets it done."
"great sports clips. weekends can be busy, but i've had no waits before. julie is a top notch stylist. i always see her if she's working."
michelle always does the best job on my sons hair-would recommend her to anybody. very clean and very professional location
have been going to this location for many years however there seems to have been a major change in staff.  just finished getting a haircut and was not pleased.  one of the worst haircuts i have received.  not sure if i will be returning...
"so, my first hair cut in dallas left me looking like i'd just escaped from a sanitarium circa 1950.  thankfully, i found sport clips after one of my co-workers suggested it to me.  if you take a look at my profile pic, you'll see a ... let's be honest... glorious beard.you can infer several things:  i'm not the sort of fellow who usually does anything other than a simple hair cut.  no shampoo, no product, no fluffery.  however, my first trip to sport clips included some free upgrade coupons.  and i'm a sucker for coupons.i was pleasantly surprised to find i rather enjoyed the hot towel, scalp treatment, and wash.  then, the stylist took out some sort of gasoline powered shoulder massager thing.  in the venn diagram of ""going to be shaken apart"" and ""deep muscle relaxation"" this hits the sweet spot of overlap which was not at all unpleasant.all told, since i left my usual barber back home in wv, sport clips has filled the niche pretty nicely.  oh, there's lots of sportsball paraphernalia and tv's if that's your thing.  if not $25 makes for a pretty nice, relaxing, pampering haircut.  but, with a set of coupons or a yelp check-in, all that's yours for $21 (plus tip, not included)."
"excellent service. always!!  i've been coming here for 3 years. they take good care of me and my son. they have had some air conditioning issues and construction in the area. they are always happy, polite sand willing to provide good service."
"can not fade men's hair. i've included pictures see for yourself. im afraid to go back to have them fix it. $25gc wasted plus the $25 value of the child's mvp haircut that was on the gc i purchased at a silent auction for a local elementary school pta fundraiser. i went to this location because i had a free mvp package gift certificate. my stylist seemed to be not paying attention the entire time. i listened to her buzz off a huge portion of hair in the middle of the fade (you can see in the pics) and she paused then acted like nothing happened she didn't try to fix it or mention it to me. instead she kept me in a position not looking at the mirror except face on at the end when i checked i knew something was off but couldn't tell from the chair. i couldn't see it until i got home. one side is rough but at least it's even and straight not faded very well though. the other side is where she buzzed off too much hair in the middle of the fade and it's just an uneven mess. the experience was also subpar. she slapped me in the face with the warm towel and said ""sorry i'm supposed to be pampering you not hurting you"". i was nice and said it was ok, at the time i thought it was just an accident so whatever. now i believe she was not paying attention during my entire visit. i felt like she was treating me poorly because i wasn't paying for my haircut. i bought the haircut at an elementary school fundraiser she should have been giving an extra special experience one would think. that's a waste of paid advertising. at the end when i said ""i normally spike the front of my hair up"" she offered some product and just threw it on my head and moved it a little. she asked me if i liked it and by this point i was really starting to see something was wrong with my haircut so instead of letting her touch my head again i did it myself. she didn't try to sell me any products for my hair which at the end of every sportsclips haircut i have gotten is what they do. oh yeah and during the haircut the staff talked to each other about the poor ventilation and other problems with the store as well as new owners. i hope the new owners see this and i hope to find a great sportsclips in dallas so far i'm 0-2 in california this chain is awesome."
"sports clips is a nice little chain for a barber shop, but here you'll find that they take customer service to a new level.  very professional, polite and i like the fact that these folks really care of meeting the customer needs, really driven by customer service.  the atmosphere is nice here, it's where someone can go to get a haircut, watch a little sports, and still get their money's worth.  great value!  i know i'll be back."
worse place ever. literally ever. i'm so pissed at how crappy my hair is. it's ridiculous. i'm about to go to anther hair cut place to get this piece of crap fixed. i wanted a medium fade lady said she knew what it was. she didn't. one side higher then the other. didn't have a double zero so had to use a zero and it looks horrible. i wasn't rude or anything but it just makes me very upset that i pay too much for a crappy haircut. 20 bucks for a hair cut that wasn't worth it.
this is a good place to get a hair cut. it is clean and the staff is friendly and experienced. they can give you any stlye cut you want.
"i normally don't write reviews but this has been the worst experience with a haircut place.  i collect3d a discount coupon from a friend and wanted to check out a new place.  it wasn't hard to find and had some parking spots around the area.  i walked into the store and no one would greet me. i went to the small and cramped waiting room to wait while the game was on.  it was a neat place for anyone who likes sports but hated that they only focused on men haircut. it was very stereotyping and it was uncomfortable.  after a while i went to the desk and inquired if there was a list so i can put my name down. they pulled it from behind the counter and threw it on the counter. they already made it clear they did not want to be there or to be bothered with any more customers.  i went back to the waiting room again and i saw people come and go rather quick. i was wondering why my name wasn't being called and went back to the front desk to see how much longer. they said a few minutes but people who were more attractive were mysteriously advanced in the list. it was several customer who signed in after me went ahead of me. at this point i was starting to get frustrated and thinking about walking out.  when i got up to head to the door, my name was called to be cut. the styles to did not introduce them selves and was very aggressive when cutting my hair. i almost thought it was going to have a bald spot due to the dull scissors ripping out a lot of hair with each cut.  i endured the process and at the end my coupon was refused.  they given me an excuse that it was expired, wasn't accepted by any sportclips and just didn't want to honor the coupon. i showed them that it was valid and had their companies logo on it. i don't understand why taking off $1 would cause this much of a headache. this is the first and will be the last time i would ever go back to this location.  i do belive it was the people there and not how a company would operate their business."
both my husband and son get haircuts here.  they both seem to like that it's cater just to guys.  the game is always on...whatever game that is lol.  they always look handsome so never any issues with the stylist.  my husband gets the mvp package with the hot towel and he loves it.
took our son for a haircut this week. wow! they sucked. his hair is all choppy and uneven. we had to take him to floyds to get it fixed (it was that bad). avoid.
"sports clips has consistently provided good haircuts at a very reasonable price for me and my son for years.  this location is run really well and the turnover in stylists in minimal.  like most businesses, sports clips has a customer relationship management (crm) system -- not unlike tom thumb or other local retailers.  so, yes, they ask for your phone number and/or email address, but it is not required.  if you provide the information, then they are able to keep records of how you cut your hair - thus minimizing the impact in stylist turnover.this is a fun location with a very friendly staff.  they always take exceptional care of me and i highly recommend it."
"i love sports and i like a hair cut every few months or so i can't go wrong with a place like this. i always get the triple play which is a hair cut a shampoo and a hot towel on your face.  the combination of the hot towel an shampoo is bliss. the staff is always friendly and helpful. weekends can be busy which equals a long wait, visit on a weekday to avoid the trouble."
"can't stand to go here.  took my son in for a haircut and was asked for my phone number which i gave (despite barely understanding what the receptionist was saying). then asked for his name, then asked again for the phone number and then asked yet again for his name. when asked if i could just get his hair cut i was met with silence and more tapping on the computer. a stylist walked up and then proceeded to ask the same phone number and name questions at which point i left. marginal haircuts at best which i normally have to correct when i get home and then this. will never set foot in this place again."
"almaz is a great stylist and i can say the same about her management skills. she made me feel like a million bucks! i am visiting from out of town so i just needed a quick clean up! she was able to step up and make my head look great! she gave me mvp treatment. if you're looking for a good haircut, a good conversation, she's personable and professional! thank you almaz!!!"
dominique cuts my hair there and she does an amazing job. she's outgoing and a pleasure to speak with. and it doesn't hurt that she's easy on the eyes.!  use the online app to reserve your spot and avoid the wait
i'm so mad after my cut here i forgot the cubans name. she didn't listen to what wanted. i said an inch to inch and half on the sides. 3/4 of an inch!  i have a part and comb to the side. she even screwed that up. i told her i don't like tea tree oil but she put it in insisting she had to. then she tried again later. i told her to listen to what the customer wants not what you want to do. i came home and my wife had to trim the hatchet job on the top. worst cut in years!! the other stylists seemed to do what the clients wanted. never again with her.

"..when it's good, it's good.  why take ten minutes of my day to write a review?... because i should. after years of having reasonable hair cuts (i have straight easy hair to cut) i recently had a couple bad experiences. i came to this sports clips really with no expectations, but what i got was an enthusiastic, caring, skilled stylist who was invested in her customers and committed to her work. i got a great hair cut, shampoo, scalp massage and was reminded i can come back in a couple weeks for a free neck/ear hair trim. give this place an opportunity to impress you. tell them what you are looking for in the long run to earn your business... i think you will be pleasantly surprised."
"you can't go wrong getting a haircut at this place.  the staff are friendly and no appointment is necessary.  you have 2 different options for cuts and always get a complimentary neck trim in-between cuts.  the have a full line of hair care products available and are willing to help you select the best product for your needs.the lineup includes:mvp - precision haircut, hot steamed towel, massaging shampoo, tea tree shampoo & leave-in conditioner, neck and shoulder treatment leaves you refreshedtriple play - precision haircut, hot steamed towel, massaging shampoo, tea tree shampoo & leave-in conditioner"
"vickie was unbelievably rude and unprofessional to my husband, who tried to be nothing but friendly at first...despite her poor attitude. if you're going to be in the profession of dealing with customers...you might want to try and treat those paying customers with a little more courtesy. if not...find another job."
"great team the store cant be more perfect and wonderful management, i have had several experiences with this location , and overly satisfied with stylist and ssrvice."
"best haircut experience in the dfw area. cheap, quick, friendly, stylish, what else do you need."
"i've been going here for several years now.  alma is the team leader here and she does my hair most of the time.  she is both down to earth and pleasant, plus cuts my hair exactly how i like it.  that is saying something since i am not good at describing what i like.  i usually give ""artistic license"" initially and hope for the best.  she hit it right from the beginning and remembers what we did each time.the facility is clean and well run, too.  as for prices, there are always coupons and they have frequent haircuts program, too.  you can sign up on the corporate web site to get emailed specials.overall, i can't say what i would do better.  the only thing i would like (and this is a corporate...not local...thing) is i would love shaves.  they do have a vip which includes a small massage of the face and back.  naturally, i do that every time."
"just got out of there. easily one of the worst haircuts i have gotten, and i have short hair so it's pretty simple. it is uneven, not faded whatsoever like i asked. ultimately i am too nice to say anything, but it's garbage honestly."
"i am not sure where to start..with the price of the regular haircut vs the total hair count on my head or the clippers vs scissors cut?obviously, getting a regular haircut now days is more than just sitting down in a chair and having someone who gives the impression they know what they are doing cut the hair evenly...keyword here is evenly.  it now is all about up-selling from the bottomline price. the cut today was a repair job from another one of the high volume hair cutting franchises, so i did have tolerance that it might take several cuts to get that mess straightened out.  still..sports clips' insistance to use the gauged clippers needs to be stopped.  this time the gauged slip on hay rake style cutter was over ridden since the clippers were not 'cutting it'..(pun fully intended).fortunately i had the manager of the store cutting my hair and she quickly went to using scissors..which really is the only way to cut most people's hair. in most of these volume cut establishments the hair stylist have not been trained to use anything but the gauged cutters. i realize it takes more time and these places only make money by cutting as many heads as they can an hour, but when you are the only person in the joint..it would seem the norm would be to go for quality instead of quantity.my overall cut was ok..it is just the feel that the focus was not on the hair cut but the products and services they wanted to add on to make more money.  there was no feel of making a new customer a lifelong relationship as most  barber shops strive to do. this more modern concept of up-selling everything and hiring average stylist is one of the reasons most men will not go to one of these franchises.but, it is cheap and it is fast and that was was what i was after this trip..next time, i would like to think if i am the only person there that i am not feeling like they are trying to turn a $12 haircut into a $50 experience...ain't going to happen."
"great haircut, friendly staff!  i had 20 minutes between appointments, and they accommodated me immediately!  i'll come here again.n.b.   you don't need to be into sports, and if you are, there are extra perks."
i take my son here. they have his haircut saved in their system so it's always easy and pain free. they do a good job around his ears too. i am always happy.
it's like other sports clips.. but this one seems to be a bit roomier and their tv's are larger.. additionally.. they have haircuts for 10 bucks from 9-11 am from monday to thursday.. not a bad deal.. btw.. they don't take american express..
does anyone know what happened to maria? she cut my hair for the last 3 years and now she no longer works at this location. she's the only person that can cut my hair and i was hoping to find out where she works now if anyone knows. #findmaria
"do not go here!!!  first story, a year ago i went in for a basic hair cut, one of the asian ladies took me back. i had to finally stop her because she had screwed my hair up so bad. i ended up leaving and going to knockouts to see if they could fix it which was a no go so i had to shave my head to even it out.a year later i take my two sons in to get their haircut. when you go in a girl will great you at the counter but just stands there while you do a self check in at a computer, seriously she just stands there the whole time while you fill out your life story on the computer. my younger sons hair cut was fine but my older sons is not fixable. she did a line on the side which is what he usually has but she went all the way to the skin and it curved along the side. the sides were cut way uneven and she covered his hair in gel before she had me come and look at it. it was so bad i just told him to get out of the chair so we could go somewhere else.checkout process again involves you doing the work and checking yourself out. however they could not get it to automatically check us out so we had to wait while they played around with it. i asked if i could just pay them directly and they ignored me, i asked again and was told no. again save your money and go somewhere else."
"sadly this location lives up to (more appropriately down to) its reputation. my butcher.... erm stylist was maria. maybe it's the same person mentioned in other reviews but who knows, it's a common name. the first 3/4 of the cut was ok, even though she moves like edward scissorhands when cutting. the end it took a terrible turn, she turned me toward the door and busted out the clippers again, no biggy some final touch ups, right?  noooope.  she rounded all of her scissor work to a point and i'm stuck with this garbage haircut. had the mvp and do not recommend it at this location (maybe just this stylist). either way it was not a good experience and i will not be back to this location. of the 10-15 sport clips i've been to throughout the usa this is only the second bad experience. read the reviews before you go."
"this review is for the stylist maria. she's cut my husband's hair twice, and both times he's come home with completely uneven hair. anyone without a license to cut hair could do better. this second time she cut his hair, he tried to tell her about many areas that she needed to fix but regardless he came home with uneven hair. i don't understand how she can't see that it's obviously uneven. i'm also posting a picture for reference of the haircut received on 7/15/17. i understand that sports clips is not a high class salon, but the stylists should be able to cut hair evenly. he's not high maintenance, either. buzz the sides and trim the tops. apart from maria, every other stylist (not sure on names) he's been to have cut his hair perfectly with no problems, and we have no other complaints about the salon."
people rating this a 2 are crazy. i had a fantastic experience. same as i've had at my home one. staff great. prices same. perfect.
great cut.  no clue why the low stars. i don't even live here and i come here when in town. great staff and quick in and out.
"first off, this is no grade-a, $100 haircut stylist--it is a sport clips. i come here expecting mediocrity and am plenty satisfied with the haircut i depart with. the ladies, if you treat them with respect and compassion, will respond well when you don't take a liking to how they are cutting your hair or if you have a last-second change of heart (which i have done!). of my 10+ haircuts here, only one experience was truly bad. i had to actually come back to get it fixed because i couldn't take how it looked. but she was friendly and apologetic about the whole thing, and of course didn't charge me anything.i would say they should lower the prices, but $20-25 is pretty standard these days for a haircut. you really aren't going to find that much cheaper.a good experience overall. oh and if you want buzz cuts, which i think 80% of its customers receive, then this is the place for you.~carpe diem~"
"i've had 5 haircuts here, 4 of them left my hair patchy and uneven. the last time i was there, which will be the last time i ever go, the woman was trimming my head with scissors to finger length, and half way through got distracted and started trimming my ears without finishing the top of my head. then she washes it, and if i hadn't said anything she would have let me walk out! with huge chunks of my hair uncut!also, way overpriced for the quality of the work and the time they spend on it. stay away."
"having been to this place about 10 times, i'm no longer giving them the benefit of the doubt. multiple ""stylists"" of theirs will pretend to listen to what you want done to your hair and then will precede to ignore it. twice i've specifically asked for an undercut, shown the stylist pictures, and instead received another buzz cut fade. the mvp package of having a ""shoulder massage"" is just them attacking your back with a giant vibrator for like 20 seconds. this place may as well be a factory for buzz cuts because they sure are garbage at everything else."
"great haircut, friendly staff, oh the shampoo is awesome.   nice relaxing massage.   well worth the $$"
i normally go to floyd's to get my hair cut however i was pressed for time today so i thought i would try this place. might be one of the worst hair cuts i have ever gotten. i seriously think i could have cut my own hair better. trust me when i say stay away from this place.
"i go here regularly and always ask for the same stylist, savannah, and she does a great job.the trick is finding the right stylist to get your hair done to your liking. not sure if this is the case too with floyd's as the other reviewer mentioned, i'm too nervous to try another place."
"imagine walking into a huge smelly locker room with a bunch of amateur type barbers. this is the place.  if you want to get that feeling like you never left a smelly steamy locker room full of hockey players that never washed their ""lucky"" jersey, then by all means, make yourself at home with an overpriced haircut.  when i got my hair cut, i specifically told the lady ""do not layer the top of my hair with the straight edge"" and guess what she did? awesome listening skills huh.  this place reminds me of a used car lot except with so-called stylists.  i certainly hope this place closes down and something less scary appears in its place."
"make sure u tell them not to cut you too high in the back, they won't even ask before buzzing 4"" off your neck line leading to ingrown hairs, pain, and a shiddy cut.my advice, the asian girls are the only stylists that can give you a decent cut.wtf is up with the softball on tv.  it would be smart to have sports that suit their target market on the tele"
"a coworker goes here and was raving about the place. ""it's great"", he said, ""they even give you a massage"". so i thought i'd try it. i did...twice, and here's what i have to report:- they have no idea how to cut hair, other than maybe buzz cuts.i have somewhat curly hair. both times it looked alright immediately after the haircut, while it was still wet. but when it dried, it was extremely uneven and i looked as if i had lost a fight with the clippers. i had different stylists each time, which is the only reason why i gave them a second chance.- it's pricey for what you get. the ""mvp"" which includes the ""massage"" is over $20. great clips and other similar places are cheaper because they don't have the sports gimmick or the ""massage"", and you get about the same quality of haircut if not better. which brings me to the next point:- the so-called ""massage"" consists of them faintly pushing one of those cheap homedics massagers against your neck and shoulders for a little while. i was definitely disappointed, my coworker had made it sound like it was a real shoulder and neck massage.- they push their shampoos and conditioners extremely hard. both times, i was asked about 8 times if i wanted to buy any product.the ""sports experience""? underwhelming. both times i was treated to clips of the wnba and sports talk shows. but that's not as much their fault as espn 2 i guess. still they should have dvd's of ""great moments of the superbowl"" or something for those occasions...is that too much to ask?the most positive thing? after the haircut, they wash your hair with tea tree shampoo that leaves your scalp feeling all tingly and refreshed. but i can buy the shampoo and do that at home...."
"sport clips is a good chain.  fair prices for good services.i've visited many sport clips...this one has some of the best staff!  i've received haircuts from several of the staff and they all seem very qualified and skilled.marisela is one of the best.  great skills, great personality.great price point and seems like there's always a coupon or special available."
just got the worst haircut ever. they have no idea how to do a fade. place was dirty and now i've got a jacked up haircut that i have to deal with for the next week or two.
"i just got a terrible haircut....my hair isn't hard to cut. 2 on the sides, finger length and long enough to spike up. he cut it stupid short in front then didn't evenly trim my sideburns."
i've used sport clips for years but never this location before and never this location again. i was over charged what i have always paid for just a hair cut. staff seemed very uninviting and totally opposite of the normal upbeat welcoming reason i go to sport clips.
"rude staff. more interested in collecting your information, up selling, and pushing products than giving you a good haircut."
"finally received the perfect haircut. usually i go to a local old fashioned barber. i walk out of the other  ""area"" sports clips looking like i just got out of boot camp from the marine corps again. will continue to frequent this location."
rosy is the best. i came in with wild hair that had been growing for several months with no rhyme or reason and brought her a picture of what i wanted. absolute perfection. i could not be happier with how it came out.
"walked in at 20 til 6 on saturday, stylist told me we are closing and leaving at 6 and can't cut your hair. i've been going there for nearly 2 years, purchased the 6 mvp visits still have 2 left but with that level of disregard for their customers, as i also told her, i will never go back to this location!!!"
"eureka! i found a great place (and stylist) for a haircut in dallas on the first try! and, pun intended, my new stylists name is eureka! great location, no wait as promised when i called ahead, and a great 'mvp upgrage' for first timers. i will definitely be going back to this sport clips."
"eureka, took care of me.  she's quick, very conscientious and courteous.  hot towel, message and shampoo... $21 first timer.  i switched from super cuts!  i don't like games.  they also have hd tvs as each station."
"what a lucky break to find this first.  i have used the same master stylist in south florida for 7 years.  since my trips to dallas never lasted more than a month, i would wait until i returned to fl to get my hair cut.  but now that i'm here more and heading to other states, i had to find a good stylist in dfw.  i asked a young attorney that lives in the area where he got a recent cut that looked well done.  he turned me on to sports clips and now i am a regular (2 times so far).  i have a beard that i shape like iron man - tony stark and it is hard to keep shaped by myself.  i got it trimmed and shaped two weeks before going to sports clips for $26 plus tip ($40).  needing a hair cut before heading to a week of golf with the boys i decided i could live with a bad cut if i tried somewhere new.  that said, i took the referral and went here.i chose the ""most expensive"" service, which included shaping my beard for $25.  i went at lunch time to avoid a long wait since they do not do appointments.  i was next up for angelina.  what a great experience.  she cut my hair the way i asked, shaped and trimmed my beard, shampoo and condition with a hot towel on my face was next in another space.  finally, a scalp followed by a neck and shoulder massage completed the service.  at that point, it didn't matter how i looked...i felt great.  best of all though.  the cut and trim were perfect.  moreover, as a new customer, i got $5 off for a total of $20.  even though she can't use a straight razor, doing a beard and haircut for $20 is super inexpensive, especially considering how much time it takes.  i gave her a well deserved %100 gratuity and made sure to do the same the next time.  the scalp massage was even better the second time and now i'm planning to return more often when i'm in dallas."
about a year ago they were under bad management. now they have turned it around. great place for a guy to get a haircut and relax with a steam towel and a massage. neck trims are free in between mvp haircuts and you watch sports while they doing it.
i've been going to this place for a couple years now and they always take good care of me. plus who doesn't love a free trim.
"they always do a great job. this is my ""go to"" barbershop in dallas. the price is right, the girls are talented and the haircuts look great. the ladies are always very social and the wait usually doesn't take too long unless you go on saturday. i am not a huge fan of the new computer system because after filling all of my info in, there is a ""start over"" button at the end that is right next to the ""finished"" button. this resulted in my clearing all my fields and having to redo it (aka - pain in the ass).overall, it is a very good barbershop. i would recommend it."
"my husband just came back, picture attached.  how in the world is this even possible from a professional hairdresser!!??  so when i went back, they gave me a free coupon for a haircut, and said the manager just left, sorry, come back tomorrow.  really??  i'm completely shocked!!"
i've been coming here on-and-off since i moved to dallas in 2004. i've never had a bad experience but once you find a barber that you like the turnover can be high. sportclips needs an app so you can reserve a spot in line otherwise you can wait quite a while for your barber to be available and you don't know their schedule until you walk in the door or call ahead.i didn't use the word hair stylist because it's more of a barber type place then it's up to you to style to your liking. the rewards and coupons are good but prices seem to increase too often.
awful. unless you like it when the stylist completely ignores what you ask for and does whatever they want. got the mvp. shirt was soaking wet afterwards.
good hair cut - a little disappointed that you don't get greeted when you come through the door.  ths staff is not overly friendly.  parking is not easy but there is an underground lot if you want to walk.
worst service ever! will never go there again treated my child poorly just cause she didn't wanna be patient with him but when i told her that she is rushing she got upset and said i cannot do this. told me to contact her manager at another location which i did they were able to finish my child's haircut and show him great customer service.
"not sure why this isn't ranked higher. granted i went in there during a workday morning, but it was a great experience overall. friendly, efficient, and an attentive haircut. they've recently incorporated new technology that makes the checkin process a breeze."
"sports clips, the franchise chain? for haircuts? heck yes!i've been coming here for the last 2-3 years for a couple of reasons. first, it's very inexpensive for a guy's haircut in this neighborhood. second, the staff is very consistent with many stylists who have been around for years. third, i can walk her from my house.after getting about 50 haircuts here, i've only had 2 negative experiences from a newbie stylist who missed a spot or wasn't friendly. overwhelmingly, i've had a good experience. for $21 plus tip, you can't really beat the short wait for a good haircut. plus, no need for an appointment and you can always call ahead!"
"went back to see a stylist that has been taking care of me for some time and found out that she was no longer there. the last time that i was there i wonder where all of the usual faces were. most of the girls that used to be there are no longer there because some,cheap ass owner issues. guy didn't want to pay them their bonuses so everyone left. i wasn't worried about the girl that cuts my hair she has a full time and was only there as a hobby, but she was really good. i called to get a haircut and they said that she was no longer there. this place sucks without the usual gang of girls. stay away! its not worth it. aside from that, the new crew can't even cut. it smells like they hired a gang of chain smokers."
"the ladies here are really good about what you are looking for in a haircut. i've never had a bad experience yet, and it's been about a year... that's really good for salon."
"great place to get your hair cut! i've been going to this place for years, they get you in and out very fast! i highly recommend yajaira!"
"came in to cut my hair on a monday at 2pm. place was not busy, no one was waiting. i did not get greeted when i walked in. sat down for 15 minutes and after that i went to one of the ladies and asked her if she could give me a guess on how long it could be, with a response of everyone is on break so ido how long. i waited another 10 minutes then left."
"i love getting my haircut at this location, services is quick and prices are reasonable. the girls known what they are doing - they're awesome at giving new ideas on haircuts if you're looking to try something new. the selection on hair products are also a plus since they're always rolling out with new products to choose from. it's honestly become my new go to spot!"
"so...my boyfriend...a very sweet and quiet guy...went in for a haircut at 6:30 on friday night.he came home looking like an idiot with an inch and a half bald strip and blunt, unfaded, crooked line above his hairline.  he says that they asked him twice if he wanted ""square or natural"" to which he replied both times ""natural"".adding insult to injury, when he paid at the end and asked for change for a $20 in the form of three $5's and five $1's, he was told that they only had $5's and was therefore forced to leave a 25% tip on a bad haircut.i should add that this is just days before our whole family arrives for thanksgiving! so, i took a picture of the back of his head and went in to get his money back.i was nice. i was laughing.  i showed them the picture and explained the specifics.the manager informed me that they do not give refunds........not the right answer.  i suggested that they should in this case.she said she wouldn't.i said ""you need to figure something out then""she said she would call the owner if i would wait.the owner said no refund.i said ""look, i am a business owner too and that is the wrong decision.  $20 is not worth a bad review and having me spread the word  to my 4000 clients that you are incompetent and unreasonable.""she went into the closet and dug up two $5 off coupons.ha.  like we would go back to use them.sigh. i approached it in a friendly manner, i was right, i had proof, i was not being unfair or asking for anything extra.  the right thing to do would have been to apologize, ask for a second chance in the future, give me my $20 and sent me on my way satisfied and content. alas, t'was not the case.tsk tsk tsk"
i waited half an hour and a stylist just took a guy that walked in not 2 minutes ago. i've spent too much money here to waste my time sitting in a chair being ignored. might help to look at the list that my name was on. the one all the stylists saw me sign. don't put your friends ahead of paying customers. that's how you lose them. bye sport clips! i've got plenty of money to spend somewhere else.
"sweet jesus is this place ever bad. i asked for a simple haircut, leave it long on top, use a #2 guard below the curve on the back of my head and fade it in. what did i end up with? a bert and ernie haircut like half the cholos have, shaved all the way around from the top of my head to my neck. on closer inspection, the part on the top that was long has a hunk missing out of it near the back right hand side. never going back, and i would advise anyone who values their appearance to stay far away."
"they are always friendly and consistently do a good job. what more do you need?  how about having your sixth haircut half price? keep their stamp card and this too can soon be yours. sports and espn are on the tvs while you wait and get your hair cut, which is nice."
"went in wanting the basic cheapest haircut, my hair is simple so i don't need to do a lot to it. i've been to other sport clips and had great experiences but this one for some reason only offers the 2 more expensive options. it was an ok haircut but if i wanted to spend a minimum of $20 on a haircut i wouldn't go to a chain."
"service is always quick and reasonably priced. very convenient location as well. the hair cut itself is excellent as well. plus you get to catch up on sportscenter allowing you to kill two birds with one stone...proverbially speaking of course. allow a hunting theme might be interesting come to think of it. all in all, a great place to get a quick, quality cut at a fair price."
i have had some ridiculously expensive haircuts and i have been to places where they do mani/pedis and hair but this place rocked today. sandra gave me one of the best haircuts i've ever had i am going to be a regular here in the heights
"sign says they close at 8 but they close at 7:45, even asked if they could cut but said sorry we close in 10 minutes. sport clips have been going down the drain"
"i always get treated well here. they hold great conversations and, if you can beat their busy peaktimes, they work pretty fast. the icing on the cake is getting a rinse after. sometimes i wish it as longer so i can fall asleep."
"after being long over due for a haircut, sandra did an amazing job and quickly done as well. she was very sweet and spoiled me with the mvp treatment. this will be my go to place in houston area now for my haircut."
"awesome customer service , zero wait time and angela was awesome with her speed, control and styling ! thank you angela"
"my boyfriend and i love coming here for his haircuts. roxanne is the absolute best!! great atmosphere, clean floors and surfaces, good decor and entertainment. we came here once just to find somewhere nearby for a spontaneous haircut for him and haven't gone anywhere since. when you go, definitely ask for roxanne! she's nice, friendly, knowledgeable, and excellent at what she does."
"as any other person trying a new hair salon, i was a bit nervous and reluctant coming into sport clips. as soon as i stepped inside, i was greeted by one of the stylists there and asked to sign in. this location was very clean and smelled great. all the staff were friendly, and from what i was able to see, great with their customers (especially kids). destiny took care of me and she was great; she really took the time to make sure the look i wanted came out the way i desired and gave me tips for the future. the stylists here are not just there to cut hair, rather they establish a friendly and personal relationship with the client all the while keeping professionalism. i was very happy with my visit and my new look and will definitely be back! i highly recommend 10/10"
jennifer hooked it up with a job-landing haircut! i went in looking like a bum and i told her i needed something professional to help me in my search for a job. she knew exactly what to do and i couldn't be more pleased with what she did. the shop was very clean and neat. i liked the new sign-in feature where you can also request your stylist and see the expected wait time on a screen in the waiting lobby.
15 min. till closing and the 1st chair to the right said sorry we are closed. i asked hee if she could please cut my son's hair we are not from the area and we were close by. she said yeah well it's sunday said fine! il cut his hair. she was slamming the comb the siccors and proceeded to cut my son's hair like she realy didn't want to she said outload how she had some where to be how she needed to still do payroll and how she should of made sure the door was locked.  it was unpleasant 1st sport clips experience. we will never go there again.
went in for my second haircut at this location. i first thought that the lady was a little rash in shaving half my head to show me how short the buzzer clip went. i told the lady what i wanted. she then proceeded to style it in a style that was the opposite of what i asked for. it doesn't look awful but it does not look great either. all that needed to be done was a trim and a little shortening. nothing more. never coming back here again.
as always. a great haircut from denise. she makes you welcome and always has a smile on her face. denise is a valuable asset to the company. you rock denise.  plus i love the way she takes her time when cutting my hair.  so keep rocking denise!!  ken
the lady with the tshirt #93 just gave my 4 year old a hard time for getting a lollipop...rude and unnecessary.
"my husband just got a haircut at this place. little did he know that the woman was going to give him an unrequested new style. he didn't even notice the mistake until i saw it. time to switch to a new barbershop. if you are not an adventurer when it comes to new hair styles, i wouldn't recommend that you go to this place. i have been trying to upload the picture but it's not showing."
great location. nice staff. i moved to the heights in june and this location is the best i've been to i. houston and dallas!i've had my hair cut by denise 2x and she's been great! if there is a wait they will give you an honest estimate so you can leave and come back.
moved to the heights from montrose so needed a new barber.  have been here 3 times and they have always done a great job.  usually never have to wait more than 5 minutes.  highly recommended !!!
"seats are comfy, great service, place looks great! jj watt on the back wall! big screens everywhere!"
2nd time at this location and still love it. i will continue to come back. stylists are friendly and skilled and the atmosphere is fun.
awesome place to get a haircut! will definitely be going back. the service is worth a great tip!
i wanted the stylist to trim the sides and not cut into the top since i wanted to grow out a top knot....and what does she do...she cuts into the top...ridiculous
"great place to get a haircut for your child! i've been brining my son to denise for over 4 years and she has never disappointed! he changes his style every few months and denise hears him out and always executes the haircut to perfection! thank you, denise!!"
"came in at 2:30 on a friday afternoon. 2 ladies at work.  signed in right behind another guy.  quickly followed by 5 others.   none of the typical ""hi we will be right with you!!!""  fake happiness you get at the other stores. 10 minutes in one lady at last returned from lunch and got me right ini'm here in this location due to changing of my office location. i'm part of the fancy pants birthday club which means that i should get the mvp today free.  what, what!!!  ha.  about 15 minutes of wait jacqueline came out and got me and proceeded to give me one of the better haircuts i've had.  she threw some nongreasy man product in my hair and off i went!"
"extremely disappointed. made a yelp account so i could leave this review. ive come to this location before and each time i have gotten a haircut similar to what i ask for. but this time i was completely ignored. i booked mei because i had a decent haircut by her last time a few months ago. she recognized me so when i sat down my first words were ""i'm cutting my hair differently."" and proceeded to show a picture and explained the haircut i desired. multiple times i said i want the sides faded longer with a 2 with the shortest point being at .5-1 at the bottom. then on the top i asked for some length and a different style entirely. i asked her to cut my hair in a forwards fringe motion and showed several pictures showing this. she shaved a .5 entirely on my sides with a tiny bit of fade at the top fading into maybe a 1. not even. then only asked my opinion after it was too late. i have an undercut quiff basically and just cut my hair into the same as last time. there is no length in  the front whatsoever resembling any type of fringe. there is no style to it and no fade into the sides whatever. i asked for it to be connected and its completely disconnected. when going to style my hair she proceeds to style it in an upwards motion with a massive amount of gel which i would have opted out for if given the option. i jerked my head away realizing its too late and she has cut my hair too short to do any sort of style i asked for. i then stated this is not what i asked for. i asked for this to be cut forwards. not upwards. i wanted length in the front. i do not style my hair upwards ever.  and she laughed and said it looks good. which i then had to take over and try to salvage some style to the mess of a haircut i received. she rushed through my haircut. my sideburns arent even or straight for the matter. had she listened and not rushed through and thought she knew what i wanted maybe she could of provided a decent haircut but that was not the case. it would be one thing if i didnt say anything either but i did. she just  laughed it off. um no. i'm telling you this isn't right?  or if i gave unclear instructions. but i showed several face on pictures and to the side pictures resembling a modern fringe. in fact. this is the pciture i showed the most. and the picture i asked the sides to fade like. i will not be returning. i very very dissatisfied."
"sport clips is a safe haven for a haircut and a little more. if you like sports with your haircut this is your place.  if you are like me and just want to walk out with a haircut that doesn't make you look worse, this is also your place. i cannot speak to the more exotic looks or challenges. i love the people here. they seem to have fun and a light amount of drama that makes your haircut experience close as you will get to being on reality tv."
"my wife was given a coupon for a free haircut from tompkins high school where she works. she took my son to the sports  clips in cinco ranch and when it was time to pay she presented the coupon and was told that it was for another location not this one. i was not there but from what my wife told me they were not understanding at all or flexible and never apologized, to the point she felt as she was being talked down to. maybe being hispanic and english being her second language that they felt that they can talk and treat someone as they did.it is not the $ it is how it was handled and how she was spoken to."
"cheston and his team have done a great job with this store. i've been going here for years and have used a few select stylists for my hair. they are always friendly, professional, they listen to your preferences and walk away with a consistent haircut. i've been with jacki now for over a year and she's excellent. keep up the good work! -mark"
"glenda did an amazing job with my cut.  i wanted something different and she did a hard-part, turned out awesome, i love it!!!  thanks glenda!  the owner is fantastic as well - i enjoy spending my money where it's locally owned and they are great at what they do.  thank you!"
five stars!!!i've been getting my hair cut here for over two years. the service here is great and the people that work at this location have always been friendly and accommodating. if you need a haircut then you definitely want to come checkout this sport clips in cinco. my favorite stylist is tonya r. she always does an excellent job on my hair and is truly an awesome person.
this place is great! tonya knows how to treat a customer!  i have had my hair cut by several of the ladies there and it is always done right!the place is always clean and sports are on t.v.s everywhere!  i am always in and out quickly and never have to explain what i want done!  somehow they know!i won't go anywhere else!
"i went in for my normal haircut and they absolutely butchered my hair. they cut a massive patch out of the top and tried to cover it up with gel. after i noticed it, i went back and they made it even worse in an attempt to fix it. never going back again. worst experience i've ever had."
will not be going back to this location.  were three stylists working when i arrived and two people in front of me so figured the wait would be 15-20 minutes.  45 minutes later the third stylist hasn't cut anyone's hair and is chit chatting with who i am guessing is an area manager.  one of the other customers is frustrated because he is having to get a second hair cut because his stylist didn't use the correct length on the clippers.  walked out after 45 minutes because it was going to be at least another 16-20 before they got to me.
"nice place for a guy to get a haircut without feeling a little awkward in a salon. they had a sports theme going here as they had tvs showing espn and other sports stuff while you wait for your turn. the lady who cut my hair did a good job on the fade i asked her to cut (i always tell them to do it a certain way that i like). i had to pay a little more but if it means my hair doesn't look like i cut it on my own, i'll pay extra."
my husband uses this location for his haircuts. he says it is a good store and really recommends liz. she's a good stylist and is very friendly. she listens to what you want done and executes well.
always a good hair cut. ladies always polite. have been to other salons who don't have enough hairstylists. this location has plenty and the wait is generally short.
this is our go to spot for our 8 year old's haircuts.  they do a great job every time!
we love this place! all the girls are great. jackie is my normal stylist. and now my one year old is a customer of xenia. we appreciate they try to keep the wait time short. i recommend getting the mvp. there's nothing like a little pampering.
i love tanya and have been going to her for a while. she gives a great cut but also makes me feel like im coming back to a great hango it place. great chick.
great haircut! the mvp treatment highly recommended!! doris is the best!!! tv's with espn going every where you turn!
"always a friendly staff, they will remember your face and take care of anything you need. they've offered me to come between haircuts to trim the back of the neck and touch up until it's time for my next haircut. shampoo comes with a great face and neck massage, hot towel as well! remember, tip your stylist!!!"
"my husband and daughter came here today to get their hair cut by stephanie.  she is by far the best stylist we have been to.  we have followed her around from shop to shop and she is now here.  i really like the way she cuts his hair, and she used to cut my daughters hair at sugar and spice prior to them closing.  the place is clean, and you can tell that they put a lot of effort in making sure it looks nice, not a lot of hair on the ground and cleaning all the tools after they use them.  we will definitely be back here!"
first time was wonderful as i lost last stylist after 20 years. yvonne cut my hair differently and i loved the look. will definitely be back.
had a good experience! thanks for the great haircut! i recommend getting a wash because it doubles as a head mass
"like this place. affordable, quick, no bs. dont forget to take the 10% by checking in on yelp :)"
"good value for money. the stylist rotate through the store quite regularly, so hard to get same one consistently."
"decent is the best word to describe it. the price to quality ratio. the customer service. just decent. paid about $23 after yelp discount and tip. just the haircut, no extras. i used to go to men's hair salon on fondren in sharpstown, but now it's too far after i moved. $7 + $3 tip. comparable if not better."
"jianely got me here- chelli and priscilla keep me returning, as do the rest!some other locations have stylists who assume they know how to best help you and either don't ask or don't listen to what your head needs.here, i always feel that i am in good hands and can relax without being forced to chat or having comments ignored. the stylists really focus on each customer.thanks!!"
very good place lexx always cuts my hair on point each and every time.. get the vip treatment it's very relaxing i recommend all my family and friends to come here ..
"rachel takes such amazing care of me every time i'm here! i never have to tell her what i want, it's like she just knows. she does such a great jo and is fun to talk with the entire time she is cutting my hair. the rest of the staff is really good as well, they take great care of me if rachel isn't there."
"since day one i been coming here the manager (rachel) has been cutting my hair. i love the way she does my high and tight fade and a amazing scalp massage. the staff is nice and approachable but rachel is my hairstylist, i can't cheat on her :)"
"great service,  fast and friendly service. no wait.  great cut xxxxxxxxxx'h&hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
natasha is very professional and not pushy with any products or services. i was happy with the haircut too. i would recommend her to anyone!
"got a great cut by rachael, fast service, friendly staff and off course sports on tvs"
"still working all the problems out of a new store but i'm sure they will do fine. good stylist, very clean, very nice tv set up for patrons. sure i will be back"
lexx did an awesome job cutting my hair. knew exactly what i needed and was extremely friendly! 5 star haircut all the way!ryan
"the first time i went there it was great! the lady was awesome!!the second time i came back because i was told free cleanups and she asked me how i'd like it done, and i asked if she could cut the top as well as part of the clean up. she charged me the full $20 for the haircut when i thought i was just getting a cleanup for free! chelly was her name and was just not as nice like the other lady i had the first time... she was just not sympathetic that $20 is a lot of money for some people."
"nice staff, but the lady cutting my hair took off way too much on the top making me look shorter and fatter than i really am.  paying more attention to the customers request needs to be of more importance.  details, details, details people!"
natasha the assistant manager is awesome. my 5 year old son loves to get a haircut here.
"great service, no wait. they remember your name and how you like your hair cut. very clean and new store with large tvs playing sports. just as advertised! megan is a great stylist!!"
hi i know i left a bad review earlier but i want back and they are really good  here as good as it gets i love the service the second time back im now going to be coming here every time for my haircut
staff and management are very friendly and professional! very clean venue. there was no wait and i was in and out in about 30 min. i would highly recommend this place!
"great haircut!  very fast and efficient. i was in and out in no time. the staff was very friendly and helpful. the place is brand new,  it is very clean and nice. there is lots of seating. parking was also very easy."
"i've been going to this specific location for awhile now, i would say i am usually satisfied with the haircuts i get here. however i was there on sunday and got a haircut from an employee i had never seen before. at the time i left it seemed fine because she had styled my hair with hair product. but later that night when i got home and showered, my hair was very uneven on all sides. i returned today however and i must say mariandre surpassed my expectations and completely fixed my hair! she is a huge life saver, i had an important job interview coming up at the end of the week. for first timers, i definitely recommend her, she definitely knows what she's doing! if you're not able to get her because they're usually busy at this location, at least ask for her recommendation!!"
"if zero stars were an options, that's what i would choose. i took my boys to sports clips of copperfield on tuesday morning for haircuts. they have since not left the house except for a quick library trip on wednesday. it was discovered this morning (friday) that both boys have lice. my youngest son's poor head is covered with bugs, nits, and scabs. i have spent nearly $75 on treating all the kids, myself, and our home so far. (there very well could be more). we have had to miss an entire day of schoolwork (i homeschool year-round). we also have a party for my oldest's baseball team winning the league championship tonight that we may now have to miss and my husband and i have (expensive) tickets to a concert tomorrow night that we may also have to miss due to not having childcare with lice in our home. not to mention that i'm pregnant with twins and am having a hard time being on my feet for more than 30min at a time and i'm left with trying to wash all the bedding and pillows and stuffed animals and treating the carpet and furniture. i told all of this to the lady who answered the phone when i called the salon this morning (who also happened to be the one who cut both boys' hair) and all they offered was to give us their next haircuts for free. i am so angry and disgusted. not just at their obvious lack of sanitary conditions in their salon, but at their unwillingness to do anything to make this right for my family. we will not be setting foot into a sports clips again and i hope my friends both in houston and around the country will reconsider using their services as well."
came in this morning and was greeted and almost immediately taken to a chair. marii did a great job cutting my hair. stronger hands for a shampoo would be my only issue but she was awesome.
this was my first time with my boys and they were super fast. i thought for a saturday they would be packed but it wasn't. tiffany cut my sons hair exactly how i asked and it was perfect. i will be coming here from now on.
"the worse service i have encountered, assistant manager arguing with me i thought she was going to hit me. she made my son cry and never apologize to him. i have always taken my kids to the cinco ranch location and they're too sweet. wow seeing my son cry the way he was broke my heart."
"i came in with a free haircut coupon. it covered any haircut,but because my hair hair is too thick i'd have to pay an extra $10."
if i could give it a zero i would my son was excited to come here for the first time showed up at 320 checked in the wait time said 30 minutes they skipped my sons name about four times when asked they said give us five minutes meanwhile they are trying to figure out who will cut his hair out of the six girls there nobody could figure it out  ended up getting on the chair until 450 everyone kept coming  in and out and we were still waiting!!!never coming back again!!! other then that the girl who cut his hair did a good job just bad management the other idiots looked clueless
"ask for jenny t. this is a great place, they're nice, clean, and professional. waiting time is good and service is great."
"this is my go to spot to get my hair cut.  everyone there is friendly, professional, and does a great job.  the service is always quick and if there is ever a wait there's always a game on the tv or plenty of shopping nearby to kill the time. i'm looking forward to going back in a few weeks."
no complaints here. they always do a nicejob of making what little hair i have left lookgood. about 4000 tvs hanging on the walls makesit almost impossible to miss a play or a lap.
"i love this location.  they are always very nice, clean, and very quick.  the people who cut your hair are quick and very cordial and helpful.  plus, if you're a guy how can you go wrong with sports on every tv?  i always appreciate a good haircut, cleanliness, and great service!"
"over all experience was horriable. stylist concerned about other conversations with other stylist. not paying attention to customers hair. my hair is crooked and parts just skipped over. 22 dollar lesson learned passed the hair wash i was pissed. to bad i use to come here all the time. went down the parking lot to get fixed seems i'm not, first customer with same issue."
came in to get my haircut fixed from a day before from the men's salon the boardroom in the heights where i spent $50 and got a terrible cut. i entered sports clips because i needed my poor haircut fixed asap. i was skeptical to come here from some bad experiences long long ago but needed it done. alma fixed my cut and they only charged me $10 as it was not the full deal so i was happy with that. she did a great job and my hair is back to looking good. definitely made up for past experiences and the staff were great. thanks!
"i went to sport clips in march and meant to write this earlier but oh well. i went solely because their online menu said women's haircut was $16. i was going to get a trim so i thought the price was fair. i went in and waited approximately 30-40 minutes and then got a chair and was proceeded to be told that the $16 hair cut for women was not available, i think they thought i was lying to them and they told me to show them the website prices, i went ahead and pulled it up. they ended up telling me i could get a hair cut for the $16 price but it would be a straight cut and not a trimming of my already present layers. i take very good care of my hair and i know that a straight cut damages my hair-- but as a college student you take what you can get, so i went and got it anyways. it looked cute for the first day, though after the natural volume in my hair was gone and a week later already had split ends. i won't be returning because of the way i was treated (like i was lying to get a better deal) when i had never been to sport clips before and i won't be recommending this place."
got a great hair cut and felt very happy with the experience.i was highly impressed by the service that included a shampoo as most times after a haircut i am left uncomfortable with short hair clippings on my neck and shoulders.
waited here for more than 30 minutes to have my sons called just because the girl monitoring the front desk is not following procedure for logging clients in. how difficult is that?! 3 other clients that came in after us were called before my sons.  lousy service!!!!!!  when i brought it to her attention she asked a stylist that wasn't even monitoring the front desk who came in first. pay attention girl!  your job is not difficult!this was not our first time here. we have been here about 5 times since we moved to the area.
"went in last week and was told there would be a 25 min wait.  ok, no problem. 45 min later someone else walks in and gets their haircut before my son.  i'm thinking, ok maybe they requested the stylist. an hour goes by, and a man who came in and had only waited about 15 minutes gets called for a haircut. such a disappointment...and after seeing some other reviews, it looks like we are not the only ones to have experienced this."
"this was our first experience here and we were very impressed. melissa and tammy are upbeat, friendly, professional, and talented hair stylists that understood exactly how we wanted our haircut. the prices are good, $17 for me and $14 for my daughter. megan at the front desk has a great attitude and is very professional. we will be back, thanks ladies!"
"worth the wait . whet on sunday around 12. very busy, but very professional staff. great hair cut plus shampoo for only 17 dollars .."
"my husband and our boys have been going here for 1.5 years.  our boys won't be back with me again after they estimated a 10 minute wait and i waited with a 2yo for over 30mn.  when i looked at the service area, all the stylists were gone... it was like with a waiting room full of people, they took a collective lunch break.  my son and i left, and i called later to see if we'd ever actually made the list (we signed in on paper instead of talking to someone so i didn't know if maybe we'd never made it into the computer) and the lady was super mean.  cheap hair cut isn't worth crap service, i'll just start taking my boys to the salon i go to."
great cut. prompt service. reasonable price. close to grocery store as well. very easy service
great location with a nice waiting area and quick service. check in online to skip the wait. great haircut from lucinda!
i highly recommend paula. i come here every 3 weeks or so. always happy!!  the price is right and the service is great.
"i guess you could say i'm sportclips newest stylist, so come see me, my name is haylee!!"
always happy getting my hair cut here. friendly staff. the new check in system is quick and easy. i rarely have to wait more than 5-10 minutes. thanks!
eloina is excellent everytime. always professional. good clean surroundings. i wish i could post a short review on yel. great job glad to be here
great experience at sport clips! short wait time and excellent service! i will definitely be coming back!
paula was incredible and i am definitely coming back to this location! i've been a long time sport clips fan and now i am definitely going to come back to this location to see paula again.i highly recommend this sport clips location.the atmosphere is friendly and accommodating. definitely come check them out!
"paula,  you are the best stylist ever. best sports clips in town , fast friendly and professional"
"my friend and i came here after another location rudely refused to take us even though we walked in well before they closed. i was relieved to find that the employees here were very courteous and my stylist was very friendly and comfortably conversational. i was happy with my haircut also. the only thing was my friend and i anticipated the haircut to be $16 based on past experience and it ended up being $22, but perhaps prices differ by location."
"friendly staff, excellent service, little wait time. great for kids. would definitely return."
i always get a good haircut from this location. everyone is very friendly and helpful. they are good at recommending hair cair products as well. there are always discounts available as well. i have been going there for many years and would recommend them to everyone.
"speedy service, great haircut, short amount of time. highly recommended! lucy did great job and ensured what i requested was what i wanted. was surprised how quickly she was able to do what i wanted."
time for another awesomely fab cut! always great service from these ladies! make it a point to stop at this location.. they are awesome
"i was a patron of the sports clips on shepherd due to one stylist paula. they asked her to leave, which was a huge mistake. i found her at this location. even though it is 20 mins away from my home. i will continue to use this location so i may use paula as my sole stylist."
paula is fantastic!  i felt like she really cared about my hair.  wonderful experience!!
"the check in process at sports clips of west university is quick and easy. the facility is clean and welcoming. eloina did a great job, and i will definitely be asking for her again. i would definitely recommend this sports clips to a friend!"
"this is my third time coming here. i went to a different one for a while cuz i did not had to have the best experience the first time. however, i saw that their ratings had improved. i'm glad i did is this is closer to my house. i had a good experience this time. i think they change out a lot of staff and it's better than it used to be."
excellent check-in system. nice waiting area with plenty of sports on tv. jas special offers for yelp check-in and reviews.
"did not cut my hair properly, highly unsatisfied. do not recommend for 1st time visitors: this was my 1st experience at sports clips ever on friday 12/8 from 5:30-6:30pm. i chose this location because it's proximity to my job. i appreciated the smoothness of being of to check-in and immediately getting a cut but that was it.my barber (whose name i don't know she said it too fast and i don't remember seeing a name tag) was nice and we had a good conversation initially but she misunderstood my request. i asked for a #1.. tapper fade and that was not what i got. she cut my hair too low and she f**ked up my edge up (she was trying to say a tapper fade means i wanted to be bald.. if i wanted to be bald i would've asked for that) i was not satisfied at all.she made me feel shitty because there was a couple times in where she almost cut me with the clippers and gave me unsolicited advice about moisturizing my facial hair and shampooing my hair.. i'm a grown man (25)... i think i know how to take care of myself.. so don't' blame me because you're not doing a good job. one piece of unsolicited advice was to ""use hand sanitizer"" to get rid of razor bumps...okay.and then she shampoo and washed my hair and it was extremely uncomfortable. from the seat setup (i felt that i was too tall and my neck hurt while it was going on), hot rag on my face, to the ""massage"" of a my scalp, to the fact that i had no idea wtf a mvp package was.. it was awkward and uncomfortable and i only allowed it to happen because it was already a horrible experience and she knew it. at the end she attempted to charge me $30, which i was going to pay but then she acted like something was wrong with the machine and took off the $30 and charge me $10 because she knew i was not satisfied..she even said ""i only charge you 10 because you did not like it"". while i was in the chair, she even tried to say oh ""so and so cut your hair hear before"".. i was like no.. i've never been here before or to a sports clips ever. as of right now based on my experience, this is not a place i would recommend to a 1st timer whose never been to your establishment and i do not plan to return."
"haircut worked wait, no wait time on saturday morning.the stylist was very professional and made sure we understand each other about the length of the haircut."
"i have been coming to this location for many years and i've put up with the very expensive haircuts and the very little attention placed to detail as evidenced by the haircuts that last less than 10 minutes with nothing but clippers. i even let go of the lesson taught to me long ago that good haircuts happen when the stylist uses scissors because they take their time and pay closer attention.  i did this because this location is close to my home.  after my experience earlier this week, no more.  this location needs to be taken over by someone competent.  i went in on the 11th of june at about 7:35 pm.  the haircut lasted less than 10 minutes and i thought it odd that the lady who cut my hair didn't hold up a mirror behind my head and ask me what i thought of the cut. i've been coming to this location for years and this was the first time i wasn't asked.  it was almost closing time and i thought it was no big deal.  when i got home to shower, i looked in the mirror and noticed that she left a big gash where she wasn't paying attention with the clippers right by my ear.  i ended up having to shave my head entirely because the gash she left was already a zero and i'm not going to walk around like i'm a 5 year old who used a pair of clippers for the first time.  what upset me about this was not so much that she made a mistake; but that she lacked the character to come clean about it.  there is no way she could stand behind me, finish the hair cut, use the blow dryer to clean me off without seeing her work.  if she had said to me right then and there, ""hey, i'm sorry, i made a mistake,"" this would be a very different story, but she didn't do that.  she chose to send me on my way.  i paid 27 dollars for this.  it is not okay. it gets worse.  the next day, i walk into the same location and asked to speak with a manager or supervisor or owner.  the person who was there said, ""we don't really have managers."" how is it that an establishment with brand recognition that sports clips has, doesn't have managers?  that's ludicrous.  she went on to explain that there was a person, ""stephanie"" who had been there a really long time and that she wasn't there until 4:30 pm.  i explained the situation to her about what happened and even showed her pictures.  she went over to another lady who was cutting hair and talked to her.  i was told by both ladies that i'd have to return at 4:30pm to see what could be done.  this was unacceptable to me.  any legitimate business should be able to give a 27 dollar refund without inconveniencing the client.  i raised my voice and explained to them that their response was not acceptable and that i needed a phone number to speak with someone immediately.  only after insisting several times, did they magically produce a phone number for this ""stephanie.""  why is it that a customer needs to raise their voice and insist on a solution before employees finally try and be helpful?  there is a much better way to do business.  when i spoke to stephanie i explained the situation to her and she went on to say that giving refunds was not their typical way of handling these types of matters, that instead what they did was ""comp"" future haircuts for the client.  so the solution you guys offer is to give free haircuts to a client after ruining a hair cut?  i am to trust the same people who messed up in the first place?  i explained that i wasn't comfortable with that and repeated the consequences of the bad job they did.  she responded by being snippy and tell me that it was my choice to shave my head.  since she was rude, i was rude too and very quickly let her know that i'm not going to walk around looking like a fool because of something they did.  i raised my voice and let her know that i needed my money back and that i didn't want to return for any free haircuts.  she finally let me know that she was going to have to call some regional office to get an okay to provide a refund for me.  how is it that giving a refund needs to be approved by some regional office?  that is absolutely unacceptable and unprofessional.  you think i'm going to trust you guys or let alone recommend you? she called me back shortly to let me know that my refund was going to be given and that she was very sorry that this happened.  she went on to explain that to show their apologies that i'd get vouchers for future haircuts.  i let her know that it would be a really long time before i thought of setting foot at their location again.  in summary: 1.  train your employees that when something goes wrong, have the character to accept it.  i suggest training in which you role play with your employees and practice these scenarios so that if they do arise, employees are prepared for it.   trust is easy to loose and hard to gain. 2.  when a refund is necessary, don't inconvenience the same client whom you've already screwed over.  when my haircut was done, i was told the cost and i paid immediately.  i didn't respond by"
great place for a haircut! they are quick .love the service ! this is my favorite sport clips!ask for victoria! she rocks!
great service ! coming back here again victoria seemed she knew what she was doing. less than 2 minutes wait. just excellent !
my 7 yr old son had a scissor cut.  the stylist asked what i wanted.  she  was fast and his hair looks good.  satisfied!!
"great location. new technology to check in lets you know when you are up. on this particular trip, there was no wait. the haircut is for my son, age 9. the hairdresser made good conversation with him and listened to what he wanted. nice clean place. friendly staff. can't beat that!"
"great place. nice environment. no waiting time. would definitely come back.price is ok, 22 for the haircut and 8 for the beard.very satisfied"
great haircut! lorena was the best! i'll always come back. can't get enough of these sports haircuts!
"great place for a toodler haircut! my kid was so quiet while the hairstylist was cutting his hair. additionally, the place is always nice and clean!"
great haircut!  ariel is awesome!  i'll definitely be back!  she cleaned up my beard. my wife noticed that she cleaned me up!
"sonia was great, great haircut and great job. i hardly had to wait. atmosphere was good. i'll come back!!"
"i'm a long-time sport clips client, but this was my first time at this location and it was so far below standards. for starters, i've done plenty of retail / service jobs so i can recognize the little things that are supposed to seem natural but are all ""by the book."" upon signing me in, she did not introduce herself by name, offer a handshake or ask about an mvp. 0/3 for the intro routine!i then explained what i wanted, which included explaining where i part my hair, how i part my hair, where it gets spiky when its get too short. i said i wanted it long enough to part and to comb, and ended by saying ""i have to be able to do more with it than just spiking it."" apparently all she heard was ""spiking it."" not even 10 conversation-free (no in-progress questions about the cut, no banter) minutes later my hair is shorter than it's been since i was in the military. why would i explain all about the part and the styling if i wanted brospike?  this location is really convenient for me, and there are obviously plenty of stylists there so i will likely go back. but (a) if you're management train your staff in the customer experience, to include listening (!!!!), and (b) if you're a customer be specific. be very specific, and have them repeat it back to you before anything starts."
great service. it did't take anytime to get me into haircut. sennai is great! clean place. highly recommend it.
stephanie was amazing!! super fast and friendly service! the stylist even helped me trim my new beard!i had super long shaggy hair and it was constantly getting in my eyes. i actually did my first hair flip in over five years and right then i knew i needed a hair cut. i walked in to the place with at least five people in front of me and i still didn't wait longer than ten minutes. she gave me amazing tips on how to take care of my beard since my girlfriend won't let me shave it.
"friendly staff, convenient location and great haircut! i came in during my lunch break on a tuesday and didn't have to wait at all. their new digit kiosk system logs your information making checking in and out easier. they log your last haircut information in so if your looking for the same cut they will have it on file! streamlined affordable great haircuts here!"
stephanie was great. got a great haircut and beard trim. got the mvp which is always a treat. was not disappointed at all.
"sonia was great! there was no wait, great conversation, and she did a perfect job on the haircut. will continue to come back every month :)"
great job by stephanie. looks awesome and she was very nice. i would definitely come back to see her. it's nice place too with sports on tv.
quick excellent service. was able to get in the monday before a holiday. attentive service and great results.
speedy service & very clean.my son's haircut came out great! thanks again sports clips! he loves it!
"love this place! friendly staff, super clean and always fun! plus they've got sports on tv. what's not to love??"
i started coming to this specific sports clips because of consuelo. she is awesome and so sweet. she is my go to barber because she cuts my hair the way i like.
"take my 7 yo here.  great haircuts, great price, no appt needed!  never have to wait more than a few minutes!"
nice place with a great staff. iris gave me a great hair cut. very pleased. would definitely go back.
well run location and they make sure to get your haircut right. i even asked for a little more length off after a full cut and she didn't get frustrated or mad and spent the extra time to make sure i was happy with the results.
i've always received a good haircut and good service at this location. i check in online and live about 15 minutes away so i never have to wait long.
great service and quick. it's always hard to find a spot that gives you a consistent cut while avoiding the hassles of having a dedicated stylist. most every time i go i have a different person but always leave fairly pleased with the results. quan did a great job this time around and look forward to heading back.
3 days after my haircut there is still a red line on my neck.  i think quan tried to take off my head. clippers should not be used to as a stabbing device on the neck.  i don't know why barbers still do this.  it shows lack of skill in making an even cut using clippers the normal way.
"great experience, quan my lovely stylish cut my hair well and was full of great information. i liked the  new sign in system. keep up the good work."
always a great experience at this location; the wait usually isn't too bad and the quality is excellent. i'm the type of perfectionist that goes home and has to clean-up/fix the haircut if it's not right; i've never had that issue here.
"to be perfectly blunt, many times when i get a haircut these days, i'm looking for a place that 1) gives me good value, 2) is quick and 3) i don't have to talk much about what's going on in my life, etc. that may make me sound like an old curmudgeon, but if that sounds like a place you'd like top get a haircut, then sports clips sawyer heights is your place. there are places you can spend two or three times as much for a top quality haircut. maybe you'll be content doing that. but this place is very good value for money."
we love this location. the staff is so friendly and attentive. i have a 4 year old and he loves getting his hair cut by consuelo. she is so patient with him and so sweet. we will keep coming here.
"great place, great environment with fun, kind, efficient, and professional associates!  in recently relocating to houston, finding a barber that was pleasant, and keeps up with the most current trends was difficult until i found consuelo at sports clips on taylor (sawyer heights).  she has been a complete gem, and making sure that my hair is cut just right to lend itself to versatile styles - from a business look to trendy style that draws positive attention!"
great people! love getting my haircut here.  diana takes care of me. been coming here for 2 years.
"the only place i get a haircut at. the staff is really friendly, and i've never been disappointed. i recommend mayra all the time. i wouldn't let anyone else touch my hair! waiting time isn't too long most of the time. came in on a monday at 6pm and no one was waiting before me.5/5"
"first time i've ever been here. walked in, and all the employees told me hello. i said hi and sat down. then few minutes later more people walked in for haircuts and noticed they signed in on the computer. i figured the workers saw me so they'll just call me before these people that arrived after me. nope. took them first when it was obvious that i was there waiting for a haircut. they acknowledged me upon arrival but then i was invisible. no one told me to sign in when i arrived. that's just basic service. first and only time going there. something so simple can leave a bad taste in a possible customers mouth."
"in my life i have had less than 12 people cut my hair, not including my dad and grandma as a young kid.my last person has gotten too popular and you have to book her a couple of weeks in advance ... how many of us guys do that .... very few that i know of.this week we were in the area so i gave this sports clip a try.i was greeted as soon as we opened the door, and only had to wait a few minutes.i picked this location due to the reviews on yelp for this and others in the area.this shop didn't have as many as some, but the reviews they did have were what i was looking for.it was not as loud and obnoxious as i expected.the stylist i got was iris, very nice and took the time to ask questions, many questions!but importantly the right ones, questions no other stylist or barber had asked me before.while in the chair, there was just the right amount of small talk for someone who i had just met. other stylist in the shop had a playfull banter between them, kinda of entertaining, and not too much. i could tell they work well together.after a few snips of her clippers and scissors i could tell she had old school technique but a modern since of style, not what i expected from sports clips from the commercials i had seen on tv.iris trimmed all the other facial and back of my neck, that starts to grow and has become unruly as i age. most in the past only did this if i remembered to ask. and it usually cost more.after the cut was approved by my wife, i was taken in the back for a clean up shampoo, hot towel and scalp massage ... all while in a messaging chair!  at this point i had to ask her if i was getting a hundred dollar cut ... she laughed and said no, just a regular cut with a few extras since it was my first time in a sports clip.the shampoo iris used was invigorating! i use a mint shampoo at home regularly.but this was even better, and the tingle was more intense and lasted longer.the whole experience was very positive!no push to buy their products and the walk out price was well worth it.i will be back to see iris.the only draw back was the location was a little hard to find, it's hidden and the address is a little deceiving.  the tv's were not very sharp, almost hard to watch.and more importantly they can not do straight razor shaves. iris explained why and i understand, so i will still be seeing my barber every once in a while for that.highly recommended, ask for iris, you can't go wrong!"
really liked sharon! she took time to get the perfect haircut for my guys! we waited about 40 minutes on a busy sunday. totally worth the wait. we also got to watch the basketball playoffs!
great service. been to over 6 sports clips this ones the best!i get the mvp every time with the hot towel. i use the same stylist every time even though their system keeps track of how you like your haircut.
"one word: ""i love this place"" ok it's like 4 words but the way i'm saying it. it's a compound word lol. serious thanks for the great hair cut and the hospitality here is grade a... for amazing. thank you consuelo"
"love this place! friendly staff, super clean and always fun! plus they've got sports on tv. what's not to love??"

"to be perfectly blunt, many times when i get a haircut these days, i'm looking for a place that 1) gives me good value, 2) is quick and 3) i don't have to talk much about what's going on in my life, etc. that may make me sound like an old curmudgeon, but if that sounds like a place you'd like top get a haircut, then sports clips sawyer heights is your place. there are places you can spend two or three times as much for a top quality haircut. maybe you'll be content doing that. but this place is very good value for money."
we love this location. the staff is so friendly and attentive. i have a 4 year old and he loves getting his hair cut by consuelo. she is so patient with him and so sweet. we will keep coming here.
"great place, great environment with fun, kind, efficient, and professional associates!  in recently relocating to houston, finding a barber that was pleasant, and keeps up with the most current trends was difficult until i found consuelo at sports clips on taylor (sawyer heights).  she has been a complete gem, and making sure that my hair is cut just right to lend itself to versatile styles - from a business look to trendy style that draws positive attention!"
great people! love getting my haircut here.  diana takes care of me. been coming here for 2 years.
"the only place i get a haircut at. the staff is really friendly, and i've never been disappointed. i recommend mayra all the time. i wouldn't let anyone else touch my hair! waiting time isn't too long most of the time. came in on a monday at 6pm and no one was waiting before me.5/5"
"first time i've ever been here. walked in, and all the employees told me hello. i said hi and sat down. then few minutes later more people walked in for haircuts and noticed they signed in on the computer. i figured the workers saw me so they'll just call me before these people that arrived after me. nope. took them first when it was obvious that i was there waiting for a haircut. they acknowledged me upon arrival but then i was invisible. no one told me to sign in when i arrived. that's just basic service. first and only time going there. something so simple can leave a bad taste in a possible customers mouth."
"in my life i have had less than 12 people cut my hair, not including my dad and grandma as a young kid.my last person has gotten too popular and you have to book her a couple of weeks in advance ... how many of us guys do that .... very few that i know of.this week we were in the area so i gave this sports clip a try.i was greeted as soon as we opened the door, and only had to wait a few minutes.i picked this location due to the reviews on yelp for this and others in the area.this shop didn't have as many as some, but the reviews they did have were what i was looking for.it was not as loud and obnoxious as i expected.the stylist i got was iris, very nice and took the time to ask questions, many questions!but importantly the right ones, questions no other stylist or barber had asked me before.while in the chair, there was just the right amount of small talk for someone who i had just met. other stylist in the shop had a playfull banter between them, kinda of entertaining, and not too much. i could tell they work well together.after a few snips of her clippers and scissors i could tell she had old school technique but a modern since of style, not what i expected from sports clips from the commercials i had seen on tv.iris trimmed all the other facial and back of my neck, that starts to grow and has become unruly as i age. most in the past only did this if i remembered to ask. and it usually cost more.after the cut was approved by my wife, i was taken in the back for a clean up shampoo, hot towel and scalp massage ... all while in a messaging chair!  at this point i had to ask her if i was getting a hundred dollar cut ... she laughed and said no, just a regular cut with a few extras since it was my first time in a sports clip.the shampoo iris used was invigorating! i use a mint shampoo at home regularly.but this was even better, and the tingle was more intense and lasted longer.the whole experience was very positive!no push to buy their products and the walk out price was well worth it.i will be back to see iris.the only draw back was the location was a little hard to find, it's hidden and the address is a little deceiving.  the tv's were not very sharp, almost hard to watch.and more importantly they can not do straight razor shaves. iris explained why and i understand, so i will still be seeing my barber every once in a while for that.highly recommended, ask for iris, you can't go wrong!"
really liked sharon! she took time to get the perfect haircut for my guys! we waited about 40 minutes on a busy sunday. totally worth the wait. we also got to watch the basketball playoffs!
great service. been to over 6 sports clips this ones the best!i get the mvp every time with the hot towel. i use the same stylist every time even though their system keeps track of how you like your haircut.
"one word: ""i love this place"" ok it's like 4 words but the way i'm saying it. it's a compound word lol. serious thanks for the great hair cut and the hospitality here is grade a... for amazing. thank you consuelo"
"laura did an amazing job. i like the cut and the product she recommended. i usually check in requesting ""first available"" but i will definitely request laura in the future. thanks!"
"well what can i say other then i wasn't really feeling this place . i loved the set up in the shop. plenty of tvs, very colorful, plenty of chairs , very sporty. when you get there you enter your email and get sign up with them . when you check in here they offer a ten percent off on yelp. even  if they gave me 35 percent off . i for the most part won't be returning . i've had better cuts for my hair for free and then they charge us a like i think 17 dollars for this trash ass hair cut . a hair cut to me mean everything and this was some last minute because they could fit all three of us in the chair bs . so we all picked here and got jacked off . cause all of heads came out worse then how we sat in the chair . moral of the story wasn't pleased with my haircut and the pricing was not worth the outcome of my haircut."
"i've been going to sports clips for the better part of the last decade. i've been to over ten different locations. this is, by far, the best sports clips i have been to. there was absolutely no wait. all the stylists seemed in sync and were churning out great snips left and right. i had jasmine but accidentally called her jessica because i didn't hear the name over everyone talking to their guests and having a great time. so relaxed! jasmine provided the most meticulous and accurate cut with minimal i put by me. i'm going back to this one every single time i need a haircut."
so today me and two of my teammates wanted to get a haircut togetherwhat a mistake i should've just gone on my own elsewhere of course they put crap in your hair so you don't notice how bad it is till later now being nearly a week later i have to use products in my hair and i normally don't unless i'm going out or something but with a good haircut i don't need it.to my demise of course i get ragdoll by my wife who says why did you go there you went with your son wants and swore you would never go back well if nothing else this review will help me remember to never go back again.ps all three of us were not happy with our haircuts.
"7.5.2018 - called at 2:24pm. they said zero wait. arrived at 2:27pm. signed into system and said hi to hairdresser. she ignored me.  zero clients in building. sat patiently for 20mins as hairdressers sat in back and talked amongst themselves, ignoring the electronic wait system and my self. i left when i had sat there for 25mins with no service in an empty building. i went to local barber across street. business must be good at sports clip if the store can be empty with 4 hairdressers, with a patiently waiting client in lobby. screw the chains. support your local businesses."
i got my hair cut between calls with my co worker and my boss. all of us got different stylists and all ended up looking ridiculous. i don't recommend this place if you care about your appearance for the next 2wks. the stylists were very nice and talkative but lacked the skill needed to do a good job
"always a great visit!  evelyn, always the consummate professional, has been cutting my hair for years.   sport clips is the icing on the cake for my hair cutting experiences.  i'd drive from anywhere around town to visit this particular location."
"i highly recommend sports clips washington/heights location. great customer service and a great mvp cut, shampoo and style. bell took excellent care of me and i will continue to go back. what i did notice on my last visit was a stylist brushing and blow drying her hair in front of customers at her station. it maybe alright with management to do this, but i find it a bit tacky, especially if customers are waiting. do your hair in the back and on your break."
"solid location just south of the heights.  it's a bit tucked away in a shopping center facing away from the street in the new expansion area off yale, but that's a great thing if you hate long waits.  i don't think i've ever waited more than 10-15 minutes to be seen at this location.the staff is friendly and welcoming, they're very detailed in their work, and they're not pushy about upgrades-- but i usually get the mvp anyway."
"what's not to like? sports, haircut, hair wash, hot towel, and loli pop. mayra does a great job every time."
minerva is a great stylist. ask for her always!! great location and awesome team! #sportclips #haircut
"i always enjoying coming to this location. great atmosphere and friendly services! laura is my stylist, and she has perfected the way i style my hair. highly recommend her!"
"awesome job, she even recommended a hair product! love my new hair cut thanks laura!!! definitely going to come back here next time!!!!!!"
great haircut.  i got exactly what i wanted.  thanks minerva.  so far i have been very happy with this sport clips.
great service and quality! 2 for 2 so far at this new (to me) spot. laura did a great job. i was going to a competitor in the area but sport clips has them beat.
i always receive great service at this location. staff is friendly and keeps wait times down. one of the most detail oriented staffs i've seen in a while. the staff meticulously cuts hair and makes sure you walk out looking sharp.
"laura is great. she does an excellent job, is quick & always makes me feel important!"
always like how my haircut comes out at this location. bell the assistant manager does a wonderful job
another great haircut by denise.  she is awesome !!  she even did my cut on her lunch break. that's how cool n great a person she is. plus the other staff members are cool too.  the only. thing missing is a beer or wine. lol.     ken
"gotta give credit where credit is due. 5 star service (the ""mvp experience"" is great and the upgrade is free if its your first time). they even turned on the nba playoff game on the tv after i asked.with that being said, the main reason to come here is for a haircut so how i'm going to rate it. this is a part of town full of places to get a basic haircut (there is even one right across the street). i felt the haircut was average...and defiantly a bit disappointing a week later. it wasn't awful and no one has said anything but its not something i would do again. the sides didn't really blend into the top of the head...usually this happens when someone goes super fast but the lady spent some time and really tried. on yelp, 3 stars says ""a-ok""...and i feel like thats a fair rating."
awesome haircut! this is my place of choice. great cuts all the time!i like the ease of checking in and then getting reminders of when my spot in line is up.
"i used to go take my kids to the meyerland location. it's across the street from my apartment complex but they weren't very good. so, i looked up other locations and decided to try the med center location. well, they did a wonderful job. they're fast and precise. i really like the way they cut my sons hair. it's about 10 min from my complex. so, it's not far. i won't switch anymore. all the girls are excellent. it's great to know that it doesn't matter if you choose the ""first available"" stylist. their hair will still look good. thanks sport clips!"
"i get my haircut like clock-work, and this location has alll the right stylists. my personal recommendation is austyn, the general manager, but they're all really good! never going anywhere else ever again. great team!"
great!briney was amazing. i love the haircut and the service. i will definitely come back and will recommend it to my friends. my wife loved it ;)
"been here several times for a basic cut. the last time a stylist cut my hair shorter than i wanted and did not blend the fade as i asked. this time i gave specific instructions : show me the cut length before proceeding-she ignored my request and started chopping. chopped a big spot in the back of my head. after seeing it at home, i return to the salon and got attitude by the person who was suppose to fix my hair. i understand we all need to make a living but lets be honest about it- fess up to mistakes, unsure about a bare-spot ,then consult your fellow stylist and inform the client of mistakes. i am not a picky person when it comes to hair; however i am very picky about service quality.  this place gets zero stars."
great convenient location. usually short wait if you go at an odd time. expect up to 20-40 min wait time if you go on a weekend (at any location). elizabeth and brittany are great stylists who chat with me about my numerous cowlicks and improved how i can manage them. and softly breaking the news to me that i probably can't have that goodlooking short cut that the guy before me left with. they also know which products are good for my hair. they've been doing some great remodeling with lots of sunlight. the upgraded electronic checkin system is great and keeps decent records of old visits. in the past signing up for the club didn't mean much but now they actually remember my visits. recommend!
"i came here since it was convenient, but had a terrible haircut experience. i told the staff that i wanted my hair shorter, but not too short and to maintain the same style. i also reminded her that i had a bald spot to look out for. however, when she started cutting away, she ended up cutting so much to where my bald spot and a patch of my head was shown in the backside of my head. i then got a closer look through the mirror she handed me, and i saw all the uneven spots in the back. it was crazy. i was internally panicking, but she just brushed it off, saying it was just the lighting that made it appear that way. afterwards, my friends and family were like ""where did you get that bad haircut?!?"". i never wear hats, but for those 2 weeks after the haircut, i had to wear a cap, because of how my hair ended up."
store was very clean and inviting and the staff was great. my stylist austyn was very polite and listened to what i asked for.
austyn did a great job. i would definitely come back and the store was clean and the stylist were nice
"i had quite a bad haircut by brittany.  she was not courteous and rushed through the haircut, being quite harsh with cutting and shaving.  she didn't even ask me at the end if my hair looked okay.  really want a refund :(."
"i have used sports clips many times in the past, in various states from texas to mississippi. this review is directly related to this establishment as all others i've visited have been wonderful. if there were any way i could give zero stars, i would. i didn't make it past the front desk because i had at first mistaken the staff as statues since they failed to move from their obviously comfortable sitting position to acknowledge that a customer entered. they also didn't speak until spoken to; i double checked the sign to make sure i went into the right door instead of mistakenly going into a funeral: a smile would have undoubtedly broken the two female employees faces and the space-time continuum. i am, like a large part of the male population, in the ""fade phase"" of hair styles. after i asked if there was any particular person who specialized in performing said hair-cut (since i do have a choice because i'm paying money for a service), one of the girls told me rudely that everyone here has been cutting hair for a really long time and we all know how to do that cut. i, holding my tongue, told her i appreciate her time, but would be going somewhere else. i headed directly across the street to zam's hair studio where the owner, maria, gladly worked me in and gave me one of the best cuts i've ever received with a smile. hospitality, it seems, is only located on one side of west holcombe blvd."
"this is my go-to place for haircut as a rice students! located in the med center plaza, sports clips is also close to many shops and food joints so i can always take care of other errands at the same time, but even when i just want a haircut, sport clips is still my first destination to do when i'm on campus!as the name suggests, there are four hdtvs on both side of the salon, playing the most popular live sports matches of the day. by default, all four screens will show the same screen so you can't miss it when you have to turn around, but you can also request to have one screen to show a particular match that you want to see. don't worry about missing an important match for a haircut if you come here!even if you are not a huge sports fan, expect quality service from the staff here. like others have said here before, you will get a good haircut in a clean professional setting at an average price. the staff will also keep a detail of the previously requested haircut in the database too so you don't have to worry about a thing if you want the same haircut that you got last time!the bottom line is, you can't go wrong with this place!"
"two words:  horrible service.  with all of the sports clips locations in this city, you would thing they'd try a bit harder.  but no.  i signed in and waited for a half hour to get my turn, only to find out they just threw away the sign in sheet i was on.  they were hoping i'd go away because they had too many people there.  for a business to tell their customers ""go away, i don't want you here right now"" is just ridiculous.  and it is a business i refuse to give my money to.  i will never be back, and i hope no one else will either."
"can't beat the price! have been going here for the past 6 months and have had a great cut each time i go. the team listens to the requests i have and gives me their opinion what looks best (i really appreciate the opinion of those who know what they are doing vs agreeing with me as i learn how to maintain a stylish ""professional"" look.) amber, brittani, and jerica each do a great job each time i stop in. no appointment needed in advance. wait times are very reasonable, but being close to rice university there is a busier schedule during the school months."
my husband gets his haircuts here every two weeks and elizabeth does an awesome job! he has been coming to elizabeth for two years! the staff is very friendly and the shop is always clean. nothing but the best! i highly recommend this sports clips!
always get great service at sportclips along with a great haircut. i always have a friendly hair stylist.  also enjoy the mvp service.
"i usually go to another barber shop, but i was in need of a haircut close by and walked in one day without an appointment. i waited around 45 minutes before i was helped. i used the yelp check in offer. it was worth the money. my hairdresser was not very talkative, but she wasn't overly friendly either; however, i appreciate being able to watch the game on the monitors without bother. she did not cut my hair on top as requested, using the buzzer where i requested scissors. but this is a minute detail. in all, my experience was nothing special. i ended up tipping her the difference - using the money that i saved with the check-in offer. i am not sure if i would return, unless i come for the neck trims."
i went here for an emergency haircut during lunch time. it just got super shaggy fast before a big event the next day.  no wait. it was a 20 dollar haircut that took 10 minutes. i thought it was pretty expensive but the stylist actually gave me one of the best haircuts i've had.  it shaped my head very well.  so i say it was worth it
still the best place ever to get a haircut. best service ever. that's the only reason i come every week! everyone is soooooo nice. and they all seem to be able to cut great hair. but i usually only see elizabeth. she's the best! even when there's a lot of people they seem to manage it extremely well.
elizabeth was my stylist and was very helpful and did a wonderful job styling my hair
"this is the only place i go for a haircut, the hairstylists are excellent and the wait is never too outrageous.                      ask for heather!"
"my online check-in ""appointment"" allowed me to be seen with-in 2 minutes of arrival.tori comes highly recommended, and i will be back for my next haircut!this was my first experience not only at this location, but at any ""chain"" barber shop.before: 8 inches on top combed over, 2 inch sides. original cut was in trend.after: 3 inch wave on top, starting with a 7 on the side, switched to a 5. tv's everywhere.locker room memorabilia galore.indubitably lives up to it's name!tori listened and looked at sample images with confidence.if you are in the place i was before coming in, get checked in now! just do it."
i've been coming to this location for years and all i've found is extremely good stylists.. right now i'm  waiting for jazmin... she is amazing everytime when i need a hair cut..  don't mind to wait if she is busy.. ( well ..on my days off lol. ) the rest of the stuff is also professional . thanks sportclips..
jasmine is so nice and creative. she suggested me to try something new and i did..my haircut looks amazing!
always come here every 2 weeks to get my haircut. friendly & courteous staff. shonta is awesome. keep up the good work. will be back soon.
went to this location when my regular spot was too 'busy' to take a walk-in. i was greeted the moment i walked through the door. check in was painless and quick. jasmine was amazing at her job. very friendly and courteous. i will be returning to this location in the future. well done sports clips!
"hubby needed a hair cut and we don't like the sport clips around our home, so we decided to try this place. they did not disappoint us at all. heather did such a great job! she knows exactly what we want and she is fast and precise. i wish we would come here earlier."
"did use this location as my preferred location. but since they ""released"" paula. i would not use this location if a million dollar interview depended on it."
"since moving into the area in 2012, i've been visiting this sports clips location for over 5 years now and have never needed to even explore any other hairdresser.what else is there to say... heather and their team are fantastic. services are well priced, their team is very friendly and down to earth and i always enjoy the cut and mvp experiences. it's something i look forward to each month!never truly had a bad experience and personally speaking, heather has always done a great job and is someone i'm glad to support. she's a great person and great leader of this local business and someone that ownership should hang on to! i can tell she has a big part to do with making the place what it is and building a culture which isn't always an easy thing when you are in a services business.i highly recommend this business and their people. as an added bonus and if you enjoy your sports, then you'll get plenty of news with their in salon tv's."
"heather was incredible!! mvp was a great package with haircut, shampoo, massage and clean up. very professional and knowledgeable, also very efficient, always clients in and out"
i just want to say i and my son got our hair cuts today and shanna did a great job on both my wife loved how his hair turned out.she does  awesome .thanks shanna at the store a katy mills
came here for haircuts for two of my sons. both had great stylists. they took their time with them and talked us through their recommendations vs what we thought we wanted. one of my sons can be a little picky and slow to make decisions. the stylist was extremely patient with him.bonus! they were playing yesterday's astros' win on all the screens ! go stros!hoping to add a pic here:
"so after my previous negative experience, i came in and spoke to heather, the same stylist, again. it looks to me like the haircut was uneven and that it was a bit longer on the right side of my head. she insisted that it's just a cowlick and that my hair grows in a different direction in that area, but she sat me down and used the the electric razor and a comb to even it out.i'll take that as a sign that she at least partly saw what i was talking about, but i'm sure she'd disagree. that said, she did offer some great recommendations about how to tackle future hair cut requests to avoid this situation recurring.i think she was about to leave for the day, but she stayed to do both the fix and an all star treatment for me. i'm in the waiting area right now updating my review as she rushed out the door.based on both trips, i highly recommend heather as a stylist. her service was a high point on the previous trip and she was exceptional in getting me taken care of on this trip."
"first time at this barber shop. i was looking for a new place and chose this barber shop because it had good reviews and had a 10% off yelp check in offer. the cut be char and mvp experience was great. however when i went to check out and wanted to redeem the 10% off (which could have been applied on top of a new customer promotion they do too), char was told by whom i believe was the asst manager that i actually needed to post a review, and show them the stars. there was no mention of this condition in the check in. that really puts a customer on the spot and forces an awkward  potentially fake 5 star review. reviews shouldn't be forced, and doing so for 10% off is like a bribe. i opt out and didn't redeem the yelp offer. otherwise, my barber char was very nice and helpful and i still left her a deserving tip."
"my 13 yo got a great cut from jasmine today! the whole process was quick, smooth, and easy. we will definitely be back!"
got my hair cut by shonta and she was friendly and professional and did a great job. thanks!
"when i was growing up sci-fi had made an illusory promise that by this time there would be a permanent technocrat solution to the regularly occurring every four week problem where it was time to get my hair did to account for the new growth, and as an adult in houston to clearly distinguish myself as not-a-homeless person since i could afford a haircut. there were supposed to be implantable chips to stop all hair growth as you preferred to switch her on and off; just the same as there were supposed to be flying cars parked in our space driveways and state of the art anime waifu 3-d wives waiting for us at home. instead the most exciting piece of tech in our life under the trump administration is taco bell's naked chicken chalupa dropping nationwide this thursday, the 26th.my mother laughed at me for going to the supercuts once - right before i went on the teevee to jaw about some 'tics (industry speak for the politics) - and she laughed at me slightly less for mentioning that i was coming here (sportclips) instead as a commonly accepted sort of upgrayedd over the count olaf's lesser-henchperson moonlighting as a haircutter cutting your hair experience at the supercuts. i don't think a cheap and easy haircut is holding me (me, a grown ass man) back in life. but maybe it is. so i actually came here to try something diff instead of continuing to go to supercuts which was convenient and easy, but at the expense of half or more of the haircuts appearing to have been done by someone who was on lean or just severely bad at their chosen profession if that was them doing it without having downed half a box of merlot just to get to the early afternoon lamenting the utter dearth of anime waifus and flying cars in grande olde 2017.my first visit here to the sportclips i got my hair did in a way which was one of the best haircuts of my life. i had to tone it down looking in the mirror so frequently and at such length until i got out of the shop and into my car otherwise i would have done jay's (of jay and silent bob infamy) full ""i'd fuck me"" scene from the film clerks ii. for $25 including a large tip this was worth every penny. this is the kind of value you want out of every purchase in life that it makes you feel like you'd fuck yourself, in the good way (consider the discussion between bettina and ruth fischer in six feet under discussing the relative value of a consumer beautification purchase in a department store versus the same expense in a grocery store buying necessary kitchen staples: ""but a bag of groceries doesn't make you want to look at yourself!"") rather than in the bad way comedian david cross identified.my second & final visit here i received one of the worst haircuts of my life. my red sox cap (jackie, owner of jackie's packie out on route 34, yells out ""go sox"" in the background) got some heavy use for about three weeks until things started to grow back enough to cover up the american war crimes that got did to my hair while i was getting my hair did. this felt like $23 too much to feel like that, especially considering we were not in tikrit any longer. that is not the right way to get your hair did, not at all.between my 5 star experience and my 1 star experience a three star is fair for balance overall.bald people have life on easy mode not needing to pay to get their hair did any more. perhaps this is what sci-fi was trying to tell 12 year old bookworm me - and to get those bald monday discounts at the neptune subs because those george costanza-looking mfs don't need to pay for haircuts and they get cheap sammiches too. that is life on the easiest mode possible.2/9/17 edit: originally a three star as posted but adjusted downward to a one star based on owner comment appended to review. sometimes silence is better than shouting into a tornado hon. you really cherry pick which reviews you respond to as well - never the obvious 5 star shills you must have paid for, or that have come from your friends, family members, or people you have otherwise enticed to shill for you on yelp. and of course you ignore the one star reviews that really knock your ass down a peg (hoang t., barret b., ana m., etc.) man, get a hobby besides yelping because you clearly suck at it (and not in the way your father excels at - if he had a yelp page i would give him five stars for what he does out back behind the dumpsters at the local dairy queen.)"
one more time i had the best haircut. my favorite tori with her magic hands. thanks again!
"heather, and all the girls at this location are amazing.some places you come in and easily have to wait close to an hour, not here. in the 10+ times i've been here the longest wait would be 20 min. easy in, easy out. although all the girls are amazing, heather goes above and beyond just a hair cut."
this sport clips location has the best hair stylists. hands down!!! i would recommend this location to anyone looking to get a haircut. great management also keeps things very efficient.
"what's there not to say about a free haircut and how sport clips earned it.there's a ""free mvp haircut"" coupon that gets sent in mailer packs to residents of the south bay beach cities that offers that free haircut.  usually, folks are reluctant and think there's either upsells, or strings attached.have no fear!  the coupon is legit and welcomed.  it's only good once for 1st time customers, so, once you get one and use it, you've gotten your free experience and are ineligible to use that free haircut coupon again in the future, which makes sense, since what business not being a charity, can operate giving free haircuts?  you simply can call them up, see if they're busy, show up, bring the coupon, bring your valid photo id, sign up (phone and/or email) to get into their system/database, and you get a free haircut.  for men with simple needs, it's about a 30 minute experience.the mvp treatment gets you a hot towel and massage.the manager, tam, welcomed me, processed me into the system and cut my hair.  she has a charismatic personality, and socially friendly.  i think if i come back again as a regular customer, i'd entrust tam to cut my hair again and always.if you use the coupon, it's totally free, no fees... but i'd suggest you leave a cash tip of gratuity since the haircut is roughly a $30 value.parking is rather easy and this shares the same lot as 7-eleven and an amigos tacos mexican restaurant, tucked away, but easy to find, on artesia before you reach sepulveda or the mcdonalds coming up from hawthorne/inglewood/aviation."
"if you want to be treated horribly then this sport clips is for you!i arrived at 11:40am on a saturday and there were lots of people waiting.rose told me it would be an hour wait. i said ok i will come back. i arrived back at 12:35pm and most of the waiting people were gone.the woman at the desk said she was going to take a kid before me when i asked if it was my turn yet. she took my name and said i was not in the computer. i told her rose took my name down. she said rose was on a break even though i just saw her cutting someones hair just moments before that. i had to go in the back to look for rose who admitted that she talked to me and admitted that she did not put me in the computer. i said i was not being treated fairly and demanded to be put in my original place in line. the woman at the desk asked me if i wanted to be put in the computer. i told her that i wanted to be put in the computer from 1 hour ago. i told her either treat me fairly or i will never come in here again. i have been going there for a long time (years). they didn't care about me or my business. they didn't care that rose admitted to talking to me or that i had a place in line from an hour ago. they looked at me as if i was non human and did zero to fix or acknowledge the problem and they let me walk. i called the corporate office asking for some reasonable resolution and they said that the owner would call me. of course that did not happen. keep in mind that i was a long time customer and this is the way they treated me. how will they treat a new customer? again, if you want to be treated poorly then this sport clips may be for you!"
"my son and i have been going there since they first opened. we have also referred lots of ppl there!!not sure what has happened recently but several times we have come lately they only had one stylist working and their wait was at least an hour and a half or more. also new stylists every time we go there!!last sunday i went in after going in the day before (again only one stylist) with my son and i for cuts. my son went first and i told the stylist the basic info but also said all of the info was in the computer. after a good half hour i noticed his hair cut was not even close. i talked to her again and asked if she was blending his hair on the sides and she said yes, i also said are you also cutting his hair around his colic as in the notes so his hair doesn't spike up and she said yes. another 15 plus minutes go by and i had the same questions for her and got the same answers. this time the other stylist went over to help. i went up again and told her it's still not right!! 5 minutes later a third stylist stepped in and said i was wrong that the lady was cutting his hair right! i said no other person there has cut it wrong before!  i told them to stop because my sons school pics were the next day and it was only getting worse and her response was to have the lady cut his hair even shorter.my son always got his hair cut with a #1 clipper and a nice clean blend on the back and sides. he normally spiked his hair in front messy land the top by his colic layer cut so his hair would lay down nice.my 13 year old told me later the stylist never even looked at the info in the computer which all the previous stylists normally would print out. she also told my son that his dad wasn't listening to her!at that time i told them we were done!!!the lady gave me the owners name and said to contact them during the week. i'll never go back!"
"it's a nice place to go and get the basic men's haircut as that's what they usually do at these places that have a brand name logo. they got lot's of sports channels playing on their television sets while your either waiting or getting the haircut. they wash your hair and rinse it out. not sure about women getting a haircut unless they are into getting a short haircut style like the men who does get that certain look style. they will take you with and without an appointment. i was given free cards to pass out to recommend the one who had cut my hair and yes i liked it, even that i wanted more shorter, but they didn't have the machine to do so. you will get a free haircut after so many going back to the same person who had cut it for you. the haircuts prices are so and so reasonable if you earn a lot of money and willing to spend for all the things that they do for the haircut you want while wanting to watch your sports channels as they will change it to your current sports your into.. that's right, you won't miss a football or baseball game as all you got to do is ask if they can put your current play game on their television sets and just enjoy it while you are waiting until called or getting the haircut ."
"who owns this franchise? this is a revolving door of hairstylists that can only indicate two things. the company treats its employees like dispensable minimum wage dogs, or the owner treats them like ______!as a rather loyal customer to the chain i have lost all hope in it and i refuse to blame it on the stylists. this is corporate ineptness and marketing cult behavior. on my last visit 3 weeks ago i stood in the doorway waiting almost 20 minutes for a cut while there was not one other customer in the joint. as i occupied myself patiently on my phone 2 hairstylists listened intently but terrified to the 3 corporate managers and the owner lecture them on ""best practices"". how the mvp up-sell was crucial to the business profits and conditions of their employment. both staff members nodded in hesitant agreement to the scripted blabber while occasionally glancing over at their one and only customer. everyone could clearly see me waiting, getting progressively agitated. i finally decided i had enough after 20 minutes and proceeded to leave. one of the clippie clan in matching logo shirts and clipboard asked me if i needed a cut to which i simply replied, ""sorry, rcustomers come first and clearly you are the ones not paying attention"". by the time i got to my car the owner (?) ran out and offered me a free haircut. unfortunately much too late."
"i've been in this store for about an hour. i walked in around 4pm and there was one customer with one stylist. the second stylist was not available - nor did i know anyone else was here. after the stylist who greeted me finished with her customer she then alerted myself and the gentleman before me that she would be leaving. there had been one check-in online ahead of the one person waiting and myself - he didn't show up until 15 min after 4. they put him in front of me. the stylist that was unavailable who i never saw was apparently with a customer working on a fade that took over a half hour. i never heard them and was very confused as to where they were for about 40 min? if it takes her that long to work on one persons fade than i can't imagine how long it would take her to cut my hair let alone the dude in front of me. the stylist that is currently working is carrying on a conversation and is taking her time and the stylist who greeted me continues to tell myself and everyone that she's working off the clock to assist. the customer who is in front of me, timothy, checked in online at 3:45pm. only one person was with the current stylist since that time. this is a waste of my time and everyone else's time. it's now 5:05 pm. a mom and her son that came in after me already walked out before me. i've decided to leave."
"this is my regular haircut spot and i will continue coming back. after checking in during a busy time, i left to run errands only to return and find out that my name had already been called. tam recognized that i had previously checked-in and still saw me as soon as she could. she turned the bad mood i was in into a good one and gave me a haircut that will keep the ladies swiping right (i hope!!) tam, you're the mvp."
one of the worst cuts i've ever had. told her to snip the ends off and she takes 3 inches off. butchered me!then they cant figure out how to clear a previous sale in the pos system. i gave em the worst $22 in cash that i've ever spent and got out of there!
terrible haircut. i was waiting for nearly an hour when there was a mixup with the line since the pos system was out. the lady who cut my hair was nice but it was her second day on the job and my haircut came out uneven.
"i go for a simple thing , first time going into this "" sports clips"" i sit down and the lady whose going to do my haircut and line up . starts with the line up first i can feel her hurting me with the machine , she does a terrible job doing a simple line up. when she shows me the back of my hair line , i knew i shouldn't get a haircut from her so i just told her i don't need a haircut and she still charged me $5 when the hairline was obviously lopsided and just terrible. dont go to this place, i recommend stormys chop shop."
"our boys have been getting their haircuts here for about 2 years.  the haircuts are generally ok.  but the wait time is consistently terrible.  on weekends, the place is packed.  even when there are 5 stylists, they don't move customers through efficiently. and the process to check out and pay is painfully slow. we wouldn't mind waiting for an amazing haircut.  but we don't get amazing haircuts and come here for the convenience.  but, it's not convenient when it's super slow.  they just implemented a new self check in system.  it looked like it would make things more efficient, but it has kinks and made the process even slower. we are going to start taking our boys someplace else."
"wow....asked for a ""5"" on the sides and the back and got a ""2"" all the way up to the top of my head....not even a 3 or a 4 but a two !      when i reminded her that i asked for a ""5"" and that my printed record indicates a ""5"" on sides/back she said ""oh, i'm sorry"".    it was as if she had never cut hair before.by far the worst haircut i've ever had....uneven and not even close to what i asked for.  don't go here if you like your hair cut the way you want it."
"watched 4 people walk out over the last 45 min i've waited here... stupid slow, people complaining in waiting room about how slow... do not come here in the eve not worth it it's like the dmv... with one person doing hair..."
"i have been getting my haircut there for almost a year now and i will only let kristen cut my hair and boys hair. she is amazing. ask for her every time. unfortunately today i had the worst experience today whilst getting my hair cut. kristen was by herself and in the middle of cutting my hair when the phone started to ring. it rang probably 6 different times. it turned out is was a worker named yolanda. not only was she late (there were 4 people waiting for haircuts) but she was for some reason screaming at kristen. kristen told her she was in the middle of a hair cut and told her she needed to go. this employee called another three or four times. if this had been my first time at this location i would not come back. i don't know who this other employee yolanda is but her behavior is unacceptable, abusive and disrespectful. if i was rating my experience today, it would be a 1 star.if i were the owner, i would staff more people because i watched 5 customers come in and see only 1 employee cutting hair and left. in the time i was there i watched over $100 worth of business leave. if kristen leaves, i will no longer get my kids or my hair cut there."
don't waste your time here. stylists chat while customers wait. cuts have been consistently terrible and staff just seems incompetent. came here for convenience. found fantastic sams is in the same plaza and much better.
if you get kristen it is worth every penny.  she is a skilled and talented hair stylist (not that i need one) but the best part is she likes her job and makes you laugh.  next time i am going for the mvp as she is said to have the best hands in the business!
kristin is the best. gives a great relaxing haircut. by far the best there is at this location. she is the only reason i go here. others try to rush you through but she is all about giving you a great haircut and takes her time to make it an enjoyable experience. she is worth double the cost!!
they took forever to cut my sons hair and left him looking like lloyd christmas. worst haircut ever. there's not a single piece of hair that was cut evenly on his head.
"hey sport clips owner, pay attention. i don't know if you like your stylists turning people away because that's what they're doing. check your cameras. i walked in at 4:13 today. i'm in your store as i type.dawn greeted me as i walked in and greeted me with ""it's 4:13, your looking at a 45 minute wait""- not hello, not hey welcome... those were the first words out of her mouth. i looked around, two people ahead... i call her bluff and say, it's okay we can wait. i can feel her irritation.you currently have two people working. a father comes in at 4:16 and she says, as he opens the door, "" it's 4:16, there's a 45 minute wait and we close at 5"" - he gets the hint and leaves. i'll update this an a few minutes.edit 4:22: rose just came up and greeted us and was very sweet. rose 1, dawn 0edit: 4:50 someone just walked in... rose told him, uhhh, we close at.... when she gets done (points at rose in the back) we'll take you.edit: 5:20 we just got finished with our haircut. typing this outside the salon now. dawn did cut my sons hair great. she was friendly with him. it was a little awkward for the both of us, given the first impression she gave me. i give her credit for not rushing the cut despite being closed.final review: would i come back, yes. just to see. i'm hoping it was a bad day and dawn just felt like she had to go home. otherwise, post a sign that says last client in at 4:15 or close earlier. maybe these people need to get paid more so they don't mind keeping the client list open until 5. hope you guys figure it out. seems to be a hit or miss. rose 1. dawn 2"
"i went a few months ago. i had a free haircut coupon to use. so i walk in and put my name down, it was the weekend so there was going to be a wait. i looked around the place is targeted for guys of course, all sports stuff around and tv playing football at the time. after waiting an hair the girl comes up to help me, she seems exhausted. i give the coupon she automatically goes into a monotone sales pitch about what they do there, what the different costs are for the packages of haircuts / messages, etc. i understood there a new business and looking for customers so it doesn't bug me.here is the part the that really gets me. as she starts working my hair i ask her to clean up my beard. she tells me they don't do that, ummm what?! this is a barber shop that is target for men to go to and they won't trim a beard with a buzzer or anything? i couldn't care less about the sports novelty stuff and the hot towel on the face and the massaging chair. i got to a barber shop to get my hair and beard trimmed. overall i think the package i paid for was about $35 (i could be wrong on price) and it only took her about 20 mins to show me everything they do for that package. i hope if you pay for it it would last longer but i really doubt it. but for me i will go to the supercuts in the shopping center behind this place and get my hair and beard done in about 20 mins in and out instead for being at this place for an hour and half and still didn't get what i needed done."
"i had a great experience getting my hair cut here last week, despite the craziness that is the parking lot this sport clips shares with a handful of other businesses. viridiana cut my hair, and did an excellent job. i traversed the friday afternoon traffic to come here because the la canada location had a crazy 72 minute wait! i was the only one getting my ears lowered for the first 20 minutes approx., and i was very happy with the final product. i always go for the mvp, and i was even convinced to buy a hair dryer just so i can style my hair in the same awesome way it looked that day. if you can brave the surprisingly busy parking lot, this is a good place for a good cut."
"cherish, my daughter's hair stylist since she was 1, moved from the kiddie salon down the street from our house to this sports clips for men that's about 10 miles away and we followed her! idk how she does it but she's the only person that's able to cut my daughter's hair. the 2 times i went to someone else, they totally messed up her hair! and cherish was so nice to fix it both times! anyways, now about this salon :) it is primarily for men and i could see why guys would like it. sports on all the tvs all the time. you log on, reserve a spot in line and show up for your haircut. what's not to like?"
"i knew i shouldn't have come here. i usually go to a barber but i was in the area and needed to wash some product out of my hair. carla is the worst if you need a cut. this is the second time she cut my hair and second time it was awful. i said ""lower because i don't like high fades""...what did i get? a high fade. i just paid a lot of money for a shitty cut. i went a full refund"
"highlightscleanliness: spotlessstaff: super friendlyquality: great haircutsprice: pretty reasonable wait: manageable (0-30 mins)pro tip: if you don't want to wait, they have an online check-in system now. i've been going to this place for at least 3 years now  and always leave with a great haircut and a smile. i always ask for valerie. she's easy to get along with, funny, and always cuts my hair the way i want it. they have great mvp season passes before which gives you 6 mvp haircuts for the same price as normal haircuts. i wish they bring them back. 10/10 would recommend."
candice is the best over at this sports clips! she's nothing short of perfection when it comes to cutting or styling hair. thank you candice for being awesome and giving an amazing cut! kia is also amazing! she's on point with those cuts! thank you kia!
"they wouldn't replace a lost coupon card that already had 3 stamps on it. all they could do was look up on my record and give me a new stamp card. they just said ""no, you are screwed."" what a customer service."
"my son daniel had a hair cut today, you know he will be back to school a week from tomorrow so his dad took him over. danirl came back home telling me how awesome it was. from the scalp massage to the hairstylist (carla).  my son is 13 and she was kind to ask along the way how he wanted and if he liked it or wanted the hair a bit shorter. he has been there before and will continue to go there, but asked me to add the review for him. super clean place, organized, friendly staff. i'm a happy mom!"
"great place to get a cut.  valarie did a super job, staff is nice and friendly,  wait isn't long at all."
"first time in, melody was my barber. she was very attentive and professional. she knew how to fade and line up my hair just the right way. the mvp special for first timers is epic as hell. would definitely recommend."
we brought our 4 and 6 year old boys here this weekend after not liking the kids salon cuts lately. we were able to walk in with no problem. the women were all so nice and gave my boys darling haircuts. they even put color in at the end for a fun touch. it made the lack of toys ok in the eyes of my boys. we will definitely be back. thanks!
"all the women there are awesome, kind, and so patient. for a few bucks more i do suggest the mvp. candice cuts my hair and i love my hair when i leave. i'm never going to supercuts again!"
"s-o   slow!!came in before closing, there were two stylist but they didn't seem too experienced.i would compare them to a grade lower than super cuts.we called in yesterday to get a haircut but they said there would be a 40 minute wait. so we came today, not too long of a wait, but very slow service. inexperienced stylist."
"i have to say wow, reyna is amazing in haircut and massage. make sure to get mvp package. it's same price as other place but you get more here. plus you get to watch your sport. i love my baseball games. i enjoyed it here. almost didn't want to leave haha.  thank you reyna!"
"this place is definitely the best place to get a haircut. if you want to get a specific type of hairdo, they will get it exactly right, and they will cut your hair perfectly, plus the steamed towel and massaging shampoo is definitely a bonus. i will definitely come back for another great haircut!"
"this place is perfectly decent for the price.the haircuts here are not going to blow your mind but i have gone 4 times and each time i was sat down in a chair within 10 minutes.  each of the ladies who have cut my hair were nice and did a decent job.  i would say they went a bit off script but the haircuts were still decent, just not something where i would go any distance for a cut here.  all 4 haircuts were described the same but all 4 haircuts were a bit different.  i have been getting the same cut for most of my adult life, so i have a basic descriptive script for a barber/stylist.  i really want to find a place that can nail the haircuts i want consistently, and that will give me that old style barber shop experience without a bunch of tvs and upsells.one thing that might be important to you is--i think this place is great for kids and teens.  i don't have kids but it seems that they do a great job on the under 18 guys (and even girls) here.  for example, my close friends has a special needs daughter that has had issues with letting people cut and wash her hair.  this is the only place they go and they nail her hair every time + she likes them washing her hair!! that is a big deal for them.  i have another friend with a daughter that gets ridiculously cute cuts here as well.  last, i have a friend who takes his son here, and his cut is always fresh and clean and cute because he looks like a proper little gentleman after his cut and style every time.i would go here if you are close but do not travel out of your way unless you have kids and are striking out in your area.  for me this place is super convenient and they give decent cuts, so i will go.  if i had to travel very far to this spot, i would just go to another similar type spot."
"this place is great! candice was my barber - she worked with patience and precision and was more than kind enough to laugh at my terrible jokes. she gave me a great cut that is sure to get me more matches on tinder (just kidding, i'm a lost cause). overall, a very skilled and fun team there, and they all know what they're doing (i've been around la quite a bit; i can smell a bad barber from a mile away). it was my first time here, but i'll most definitely be coming back, even if i don't know a damn thing about sports. thanks candice, because of your wonderful cutting skills, i can face the world a new man."
"horrible, horrible. could not have been a worse experience. * understaffed* disorganized* overpricedwaited over an hour for a haircut. nobody was working the front counter. 6+ empty seats in the ""haircut area"". terrible utilization of resources and staff. shocking first impression of low standards and lack of care. in the end, the haircut looks great."
"have been to a number of sportclips and actually they are my go to place.  visited this location and honestly am not seeing what all the others do.  in terms of the service, they were reasonably nice, but also non-chalant.  went in during the week and not extremely busy, just didn't get that same vibe that i did visiting a couple other stores in this franchise.haircut was actually just ok.  person seemed kind of confused when i asked for scissor cut and they wanted to fall back to using the clippers..... and then did just an ok job.  all in all not sure about this location."
it's nice to watch a game and get my haircut for a reasonable price. candice is the best.
i've been searching for a good shop for a good price that i'll walk out looking and feeling good.  i was a bit skeptical because it was a chain but after i called them they were super friendly and i decided to give them a chance.  candice took very good care of me and listened to what i wanted. i'll be back in a couple of weeks for sure.
amazing customer service. i drive 20 min just to go to this location even though there is one near my house. i have never had a complaint about my haircut from this place. silva and juanita are my go to. people when i go here. the rest of the staff is also amazing as well. silva and juanita always provide excellent customer service and give great haircuts!this location is the true mvp
"tell them it is your first time for free mvp!! i recently went to sportclips to get my haircut. i recommend silva, as she knew exactly how to do my hair.. however she tried to sell me on some items for sale.if you get the mvp cut (free if you say it's your first time) i recommend the cold towel, not the hot towel. it burned my face. the chairs massage you, then there is a massaging session.ask for silva"
"juanita is probably the best hair/beard stylist is la... if you go to sports clips in noho on lankershim, i highly recommend booking with her if you want excellence!"
"first time client.  always heard the advertisements on the radio/tv and was seeking somewhere close to home.  arrived shortly after it opened and was serviced by carolina.  very friendly and attentive.  cut my hair exactly how i wanted. she even explained my haircut would be put on file for next time to avoid any confusion or explanation how i liked my cut.  and as a first time client, i received a complimentary vip shampoo and neck massage. (the vip is an add on w/ haircut) i also learned sc will do complimentary neck trimming between haircutsif you want something simple with a little bit of frills like shampoo and neck massage, i highly recommend this sport clips."
"the worst haircut experience of my life! the store was not bad just the service of the man cutting my hair. he was a very rude old man i believe his name was justin he has a beard. he asked how i would like my hair i said,""can i do a taper to a zero he handed me the hair clipper as if he was very pissed off, initially ones instinct is to laugh because you'd think it was a joke well it wasn't he literally handed it to me telling me as if expecting me to cut my own hair... and once doing the haircut he tapered the sides to a 2 and saidhe couldnt go any lower i've gone to many barbershops and yes you can. this wasn't worth a 20dollar haircut i could havegone to any barbershop and paid 8 dollars for a far higher quality haircut. by far worst experience and worst haircut ever! never again will i go to any sports or refer anybody to goto one i really hope you talk to this man or train him on how he should give customer service. also id like to speak to a manager and see if theres anything i could do to get that money back because it was a complete waste of money! to add on the line up was not straight i asked a few times for him to fix it amd it did not come out well. i fixed it myself when i got home."
"i like to get these haircuts done pretty early in the morning and sports clips was open and ready to go at 10:02 a.m. i showed up. i signed in using my phone number the norm nowadays with sports clips and before i could even take a seat yvette called my name. super polite and nice which is again usually the norm for most of these sports clips. she reviewed my notes from the previous time i had visited that sports clips ( in between my two visits i had gone to another sports clips where i was not nearly as happy with the job that was done.) i showed her a picture as well of the look i was going for and she got to work. we had a bit of small talk that wasn't forced. let's face it nobody likes it when you can tell someone is really trying to make a conversation happen. we joked about old hairstyles we used to do as kids, ask my opinions on fading in my sideburns and some other details of the haircut that don't really matter here because before i knew it she was done and i was in and out of this sports clips in 30 minutes. i would definitely suggest anyone looking for a $20 sports clips haircut to come to this one. the place was clean everyone there was very polite and although the parking lot is a little small it's pretty easy to get into. i definitely plan on coming back again and specifically asking for yvette because he'll, i'm a creature of habit and she was pretty cute. haha"
"i brought my nephew in for a 'mvp' experience. he was super excited all day because he had read about the hot towel and the massage! he was so cute going in and we had mark help us. he is 11 and knows exactly what he wants - a buzz cut #1 and a hard line!  i had no idea what that meant but i found out!  he loves his cut,  mark did a great job...and he got a cold towel plus the hot towel!  he said his favorite part though was the massage!!  we will definitely be bringing him back!"
"love this location, always clean, and never a long wait.jennifer is very patient with our 8 year old son, she always cuts his hair just the way we want it.glad i found this hidden gem."
"i used to be a regular at floyd's before, and had a few bad haircuts recently.  i heard the ads for sport clips on espn radio and noticed there was one in north hollywood.  so i ventured out.the appearance struck me first.  it's a very 'sports' kind of atmosphere, but not in the kind of way your dad's basement is.  it's a very clean and well kept establishment.  they had the nfl combine on the tv's (and the tv's are huge), which was a really nice touch.  i got my haircut by silva.  the hair cut was good and just how i wanted it to look.   because it was my first visit, they upgraded me to vip for free.  the vip is nice and i appreciated them giving it to me on the house, but i don't think i'd get it again.  but silva did a great job at it.  i mentioned my hair was starting to thin up front and she recommended some products for my hair  (i didn't get any, but i may next time).  the service was outstanding. silva was friendly and nice and i look forward to my next haircut with her.  highly recommend this place."
"i've been going here for about 5 months now, and i would highly recommend carolina. i've had haircuts with more than 6 individuals there and i haven't really ever been satisfied with any haircut they have given me. carolina has been the only one who has gotten it right. she takes her time, she understands and listens to what i'm asking for, builds a relationship, and takes care of her customers. she's the one you need to look for at sports clips. she's the best of the best!"
"not only did sherene take my vague instructions and make my unruly hair look great, she was also super friendly! i was desperately in need of more hair product too, the ""matterial"" ultra-matte finish mitch pomade is a great product if anyone is looking for recommendations."
this place is great. silva always does the best job. she even fix my bad haircut that i got last time from another stylist thank you silva.
"worst experience ever!girl couldn't even know, how to hold a comb. haircut lasted 45 minutes.afterwards, she ruined my hairline in the back of my neck! i specifically asked her to taper it! i gave her $5 tip.  i wish they kept a dry cleaners instead!run from this armatures!"
came in just before closing and they took care of me. shirin is amazing! she took her time and really paid attention to detail. i love my fresh look. they really make you feel like family here. i will definitely be back.
"my first time here and had the best experience!  i only give it 4 stars because of the wait time .  i had to wait about 25min as a walk in since there was only one stylist at the time.  i would suggest signing in on the app before walking in.  other then the wait it was fantastic ! hair looks amazing, she did exactly what i wanted and it was quick.  got the upgrade to mvp for free since i was a first time customers.  hooked!  totally worth it! they even do free neck trims in between cuts.  i'll definitely be coming back!"
"came in late-ish and was warmly welcomed by nicole. she was super nice and friendly and did exactly what i asked for my haircut. she even gave me the ""mvp"" treatment since it was my first time at their location. would definitely recommend!"
"great service, very clean facility, great cut! $20 gets you a cut a wash and a mini massage, so it's an awesome deal too. i was hesitant to come here because i've been going to the same person for 6 years at an upscale salon but i just moved out here and didn't want to spend a fortune and i'm glad i didn't have to! will definitely come back"
"shirin was awesome. she was pleasant, professional, and very good. my hair felt great and looked great and i don't think i've ever walked away from a haircut without the prickly hairs in my shirt...basically she is a wizard with hair"
i got the $15 for $25 deal on yelp and damn if i won't pay the whole $25 next time for the mvp combo (it even includes a shoulder massage!). shirin is an amazing hair stylist and the best chatter in the business. i had a great time and extremely satisfied with my haircut.
"ive been living in la for almost 3 years now and have been having a hard time finding the perfect barber for me. i can be very anal about my hair. luckily, by chance i came across sportsclips because it just opened, and figured i'd give it a shot! im happy that i did because this is where i came across silva. she is such good person and an amazing soul. i can be very talkative and i need to have chemistry with my barber or its a no go. she suits all my needs and on top of that she really aims to please. shes a terrific stylist, a professional, and just an amazing human being. go to sportsclips lankershim and ask for silva. you will not be disappointed."
"i have been in here a few times, for beard trims. 5 bucks, what a deal! i don't have much hair, so unfortunately i cannot enjoy all of their services. i had great experience recently with (oh i hope i get her name right) yvette. she did my beard up proper, went the extra mile, had good small talk, and was all around cool af! she said if i put some purple in my grey beard it would be ""magical"" lol. i'll be back for sure. she had me smiling."
"a lovely lady named nehar did my husband's hair.  he got the mvp.  the cut looks fantastic!  next time we're in burbank when he needs a cut, we'll be back for nehar."
"this place is amazing! a+ 5 star! the massage chair experience is a must try ... so relaxing! yvette was kind, personable and efficient! definitely coming back to this place!"
"i'm really sad i didn't know about this place earlier. it's now my go to location for a haircut. the funny thing... i don't care about sports... not at all. the people that work here are amazing. you can register into their system so they have on record just the way you like your hair done. there's public parking. it's a fantastic establishment. this last time i got my hair cut by christina... i believe that's her name. she was conversational, charismatic, polite, fun; and of course she did a great job with my hair. what impressed me more so was how kind they were to an elderly gentlemen that was getting his hair cut just before me. christina and the other wonderful lady were exceptionally patient and courteous with this man. he wasn't too keen on all the technology involved with the initial check-in process and they spoke with him in a manner of empathy that made me proud to be a human... which doesn't happen very often nowadays. i wanted to take a detour from my normally insane and whimsical reviews to seriously acknowledge two beautiful people doing their jobs very well. good job ladies."
my son got the worst haircut here a few months back but i assumed it was a once off so we went back and his hair cut the other day was even more ridiculously bad- i mean completely uneven!!.  went back the next day (yesterday) to have them fix it and it still looks terrible.  won't be back-
"amazing and efficient. staff was very pleasant and a great haircut. the staff was lively and made me feel very welcome. first haircut you get the mvp treatment for free which includes massage, shampoo and hot towel."
"i took my brother here for a mid fade & he received the worst haircut ever. it took 2 of the hair stylist to try & fix it and still left his hair uneven & cut it way too high. the 1st woman who attempted to cut his hair gave me a fake excuse that ""she was feeling sick"". & we still paid for the messed up haircut respectfully. but i highly suggest going to an actual barber who actually knows how to fade & cut hair. this place only cuts basic styles at a high price. never returning here again."
i went there today for my 10 years old to get a hair cut they seriously ruined poor kids hairthe lady that was cutting his hair was older ladyand we got home after he took shower i saw that it's all uneven cut and lines all over sideno more going here disasterwhy r u guys hiring people like this???i really trusted u guys until tiday
"i'm giving 1 star for the poor customer service. i came in yesterday at about 4:10. they close at 5pm. there was about 6 ppl ahead of me. fine no problem. but when it's almost 5pm and still 6 ppl ahead of me because the employees are too busy joking, laughing, having nonsense conversations and taking breaks when ppl r waiting....that's when i lose my patience. of course i got up and left. then i came back this morning...they open at 10am. i was early and waited. now it's about 10:10 and they are still hanging out in the back talking. i mean come on there are customers waiting. u don't even apologize or acknowledge that there are ppl waiting. poor customer service. won't come to this location again."
"i've been going there since they opened years ago. the same two girls have been cutting my hair for years now. lately the last few times i've been there, these new people are terrible. waiting when there's a large line is one thing and understandable. not when there's nobody ahead of you but the girls rather joke around and talk to each other rather than cut hair. or another time when there was a large line. i decided to wait. what a big mistake. almost an hour and the line hadn't moved. not once! one of the girls disappeared in the back for 30 min. i would think maybe she was on lunch but it was right before closing. the other girl was done with her customer but sitting there talking and talking. not for a min but no exaggeration, 15 min. nonstop. this place has no respect for the customer or your time. save yourself and go somewhere else! you've been warned."
"i don't like writing negative reviews. i last went here in december. the normal person i go to wasn't there, but i was in a hurry and said, ""sure!"" right off the bat there seemed to be miscommunication, even though it's supposedly written on the paper. i tried to leave, but then i had the stylist, the manager, and another stylist, all tell me to sit down and not worry about it. she then jacked up my hair. i asked for there to be 3 inches left on top. she left half an inch on one side realized her mistake, then left then combed over the 3-4 inches left on the other side. it was bad folks. sadly, i was so frustrated that i paid (and tipped) before i realized my mistake. once i did realize the issue, i immediately went back in and had it recut by my preferred stylist. i was given no apology. no refund. no credit. nothing. i reached out to the company and the store for a response. nothing.i tried to go back today to just get a free neck and ear trim while i was on errands. they wanted to charge me $5 even though i have a record of going back to them. don't go here guys. the people are friendly, but they have horrible customer service and the company's discounts continue to get worse (what happen to the free haircuts on your bday month???), and their prices continue to go up (it was $17 two years ago, it's now $22). only come here if you are in dire need of a haircut."
"well gentlemen!! i must say if you need a haircut you have come to the right place. with out a doubt the ladies and gentlemen who work at this location know what they are doing. i have been coming here for almost two years and i have never had a problem. the cuts are clean, quick, and professional. i have been to many other places including but not limited to fantastic sams, super cuts, and even more glorious mom and pop shops that charge an arm and a leg!! but the one thing they all lack is consistency and overall cleanliness. that is why i choose sports clips. they have system and it works. plus if your feeling special you can upgrade to a nice hair wash and a back massage. you can't beat it."
"so i needed a cut bad and i was yelping for a place and found that location had a deal on yelp so naturally i had to give it a try. i was able to call in and get 20 min wait on a wednesday afternoon. the lady who cut my hair, yvette, knew what i wanted right away and we were done within 20 mins. i got the mvp treatment which included a shampoo scalp massage and a hot towel on the face. afterwords, i got a quick hair blow dry and hair wax applied to my hair. yvette has good soft skills, friend and personable, and has been at this location when they first open (about 8 years). so, goto her if you want to have a good conversation while getting a cut. overall a good experience and probably will back here."
"very awesome experience. i was in and out in 20 mins, literally. went on a thursday evening, there was one person ahead of me and two people finishing up. the girl cutting my hair, adrianne, i think, was super nice and very efficient. she took me to the chair, we chose a style from the book of pics and about 15 mins later we were done, complete with a hot towel, shampoo and scalp massage. very cool experience!i've never had such a fast haircut, which i actually liked! definitely coming back here!!!"
"came to sportclips in burbank today and had the royal treatment for my son!! vanessa took care of him and turned a terrible hair cut into an awesome one!!! vanessa took the time and walked us through what would be good for his hair style!!  i will be back for vanessa to take care of my son in the future!!  thank you so much vanessa, now i feel comfortable having my son walk for graduation!! great with kids!!"
came here on a monday at around 1230. place was super packed .  checked in online and decided to come back later. came back at appointent time.  i was next. waited 15 minutes and no one greeted also the let another person behind me in line first. won't be back
"here you'll find one if the best hairdresser in burbank.go see nehad - she is extremely professional, precise and always very joyful.i'll definitely be a returning customer!"
"this place is really a hit or miss. i realize that two very big factors that will affect your haircut is the stylist and whether they are busy or not. it seems like they are constantly raising their prices too! i mean i don't mind paying a bit extra but at least have the haircut come out nice with attention to detail. if you happen to arrive when they are busier than usual or close to closing time they will rush your hair cut thinking it will go unnoticed. the result is a bad uneven haircut that you have to end up paying a lot for, i know from experience.there are very few stylists here that would do a good job but they are all very friendly. i will say that i do like how they welcome walk-in appointments, the place is kept pretty clean and the computer system they use keeps track of your preferred hair style (clip size, length, etc.)"
not great haircut but ok for the priceprobably will be backnice people working there
been coming here for 4 years and never had a bad experience. everyone is great and super nice. they always get you in and out quick and the mvp is awesome.
"i've been coming her for the last two years and my experiences have been up and down. reviews should really be stylist by stylist, but i'm forgiving all previous sins bc i just got the best haircut of my life. in and out in less than 10 minutes. diamond, the current manager, cut my hair. it was like she had been doing it her whole life. she didn't have to go back over any clipper mess ups or over cut any of the scissor sections. blended and rounded on one pass. everything was damn near perfect. im so freaking impressed. and on top of it all, she used the mini mirror so that i could see the back of my head. i never really understood how to do this. but she gave me 5 distinct angles, all of which i now realize i needed to be checking: rear left/right straight and up along with the neckline. f'in amazing. also, she was telling me about hiring new stylists. she actually screens for talent, so i expect everyone working for her to be capable. bravo."
"had a slightly bad experience today. logged into the advertised online check-in. arrived on time to duck in and get a cut before going back to important work. sat down. waited a bit and new manager called the person below me on the list. this is against the spirit of the process. i now have to wait 24 extra minutes. new manager explains something about she had told his person he'd be next. why did you go against the set out process? people count on what is stated as the way this will be done. i'm probably the longest held customer here through all the manager changes. no real ""sorry"" for this. could be worse. but i mentioned it when finally getting a cut and didn't want to dwell on it. manager was a little aggressive about this being her prerogative. interrupted and talked over my short mention of concern -- made it a less pleasant experience. if i accept losing 24 minutes of my time i'd rather just get a ""sorry"" than someone who will interrupt me when she broke the process to provide a favor. oh well. floyds is nearby. -----great towels and massage for slightly more than i pay at other places but it's pretty great. need to wear gloves if you are going to smoke and then come back in to cut hair;)"
"dont let pr cut your hair!!!! my fiancé went yesterday to get his hair cut. he told pr exactly what he wanted numbers and all. he showed her where he wanted his taper to start as well. tell me why she literally took a # 1 allllllll the way up the sides of his head.. where's the taper??  who has flat top hair cuts these days?? that's exactly what my fiancé's hair looks like.  there is no taper between the sides and top of his hair!! he is sooooooo pissed with your work! pr, you need to go back through training and learn how to properly cut men's hair!"
i go here virtually every 2 weeks and get my hair cut. diamond impressed me 5 ways from sunday (expression). its almost like she is an artist at this! i'm super impressed and happy. thanks
"been coming here for 4 years and a consistent season pass holder. have had excellent managers and stylists through out. today's experience was not how a customer should be treated. i had 4 hair cuts left before today and after the hair cut, the manager (diamond) says we'd have to punch two. she then said the system doesn't even show i have a seasons pass and to prove it wanted to show me how other customers have it in the system. after trying it out for 3 other customer names - she couldn't really show anything. everyone has it exactly like how my information appears. she couldn't prove anything. i told her that lauren the previous manager had provided me with a compensation hair cut because of an issue and it's not fair for her to take it away. after a while of explaining, she stuck to taking away the ""compensated"" hair cut that was given to me. it felt like just to prove a point. it's not about the money at this point - it's about treating a customer fair. i didn't ask for the compensated hair cut previously, i sure didn't ask for it to be taken away after being offered. ugh! it's not customer's fault if the system doesn't have it recorded.again - it's a great place and am sure diamond is a good stylist and a nice person. but the treatment today was unwarranted."
"this place has gone way downhill.  the nice ladies have been replaced by mean ones.   one goth girl cutter, diamond, wanted to charge me twice to make me happy with my kids haircut, i asked for a 2 minute fix of a crooked hairline that she did.  she wanted more money, and only 4 minutes after the bad cut.  me and my two boys are never coming back."
"this place is trash. dont come here. the manager, lauren, is rude and very confrontational. goes back and forth with customer on a busy day in front of everyone, customer pays and she continues to talk about him after he leaves. owner should be more aware."
"came here thinking i was going to get a clean haircut but don't let the nice location and good looking establishment fool you, raylene was the person that cut my hair. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if your  male go to a real barber shop, if your s woman go to a beauty salón.i asked for a simple taper and she couldn't even do that, okay it safe and go to a barber shop, even if you get a free haircut coupon, it's not worth the trouble"
my name is lauren and i am the manager of sport clips el segundo location. id like the give a review of our fabulous customers. thank you for being loyal customers to our store.
"this place was great for a few years, but all the talented employees have left.  now you are stuck with a fast food-style haircut.   sloppy, fast, and a big push to get you out the door within the guidelines.  this used to be my monthly spot...  now i'll pay a bit more for greater confidence in the quality and consistency of the haircut."
"we showed up with two minutes to spare before closing time and they gladly gave my son a great haircut!  so friendly and accommodating, now i know why i've been taking all three kids here since they opened!"
"this place seems to be a hit or miss... i will not be taking my chances here. i decided to try it since i started working in the area... it's clean, the female that cut my hair was nice but if you're inexperienced, you might want to practice some more before being on your own. i gave one star for the cleanliness and one star for the friendly staff. so at first the cut is going well. then she asks for advice from a more seasoned person. that is actually commendable and i appreciated the fact that she cared enough to ask for help. but... asking a few times during the cut? and then she apologized saying she just doesn't want anymore complaints.... uh oh.... one side of my fade/blend looks like it was half done... from a 1 on the clippers to an immediate 4 length. and the back of my hair... wow i don't think i have any hair in the back anymore... on the bright side, hair eventually grows back. i'm not the type to complain or cause a scene but just be warned, use caution when going here or anywhere for that matter when stylists are ""new""."
"this place used to be great. good stylists, quick service, great place. it has seriously gone from a 4+,5 to 1 establishment in about 6 months. i'm only here because i prepaid for 6 cuts and can't wait to be done so i never have to come back. the stylists are scary incompetent and the wait is forever. go anywhere else."
"the service and massage was great but i was disappointed with the haircut. i asked for a fade from a 2 and the barber strait up just buzzed my sides. i have paid much much less for a haircut where the barber meticulously faded my hair to create an even distinct gradient. the barber didn't ruin my hair, it just looks no better than it did when i walked in."
"one and done with this location. hair cut by blake. friendly, professional guy, but what an uneven cut. my cut was pretty simple - #7 on sides and back, half inch off the top to spike it.didn't really notice the uneven top or uneven sideburns (left side is 1/2 inch longer than right) until i got home. definitely not worth the $22 + tip that i paid for it."
not a great barber shop. the buisness seems legit but the barbers there are not that good. i advise you to go somewhere else
"came here thinking they knew how to cut men's hair. i told them, use a half low fade into a 1, some one named raylene butchered my hair.. took me 4 months to grow it to the length of the style i wanted, she cut it to a faux hawk... has no idea what she's doing, guys: go to a barber, avoid this place at all cost!i only selected a star because i had to in order to get this review in"
"i went to sport clips, yesterday and yoli cut my hair.  there was no wait and i walked right in.  i was in and out in 30-minutes with a good haircut!"
always a great hair cut. desiree is awesome stylist.. takes lots of care and attention to detail.
"so i had a free mvp haircut coupon and tried this place out.  first, wait was really long.  for a chain style place they seem to take way to much time between customers.  second never trimmed around back of neck until i asked.  third was supposed to have mvp cut, but stylist left stuff  out.  didn't complain since i was getting a free cut.  doubt i'll be back? fantastic sams and supercuts are cheaper and quicker and probably more knowledgeable hair cutters"
"been here twice and both time my hair was cut by jie. she is completely professional and both times my hair was cut exactly how i wanted. she even remembered my first time coming in which was amazing. as for the place itself, really cool. plenty of seating for those waiting for a haircut and tvs all over the place showing la sports. i highly recommend the mvp cut. the massage and wash is a nice touch after a haircut. i will definitely be back again."
"another great cut. gotta go mvp, you deserve it! jie did my cut this time around and did a nice job. never been disappointed here."
"i gave this location 3 stars several months ago due to some poor experiences. i then deleted that review because i started seeing improvements with the haircuts over the past couple of months. unfortunately the poor experiences are starting to happen all over again. i paid $25 for a haircut that wasn't evenly cut, wasn't as short as i asked and just simply didn't go for the style i asked for (my hair was somewhat styled and they just had to clean it up and be done.) while the older woman was cutting my hair, instead of moving the clippers around as they're in use, the lady just drags the cord either across my face or around my neck. felt like she had no respect for me. she also didn't clean me after she was done and then sent me to the front counter and had someone else ring me up. i love sports clips - especially the chino hills location but this location is so back and forth, i'm gonna officially stop going here and take my business elsewhere."
"i came here ten minutes before they closed no a saturday night and they were welcoming and still took me in. i was the last one and was taken care of by jocelyn. from start to finish, i had a very comfortable and awesome experience.the place looked nice, sports was on tv, and the employees are skilled. i got the mvp experience. my haircut was amazing and the hair wash, massage was even better. she was also very knowledgeable on hair product and taught me a few things. overall, it was a great experience and i thoroughly enjoyed my time there. i will definitely be going back to a sportclips."
"jie has been cutting my hair for the past year. she really listens to what i want, unlike other stylists. i would highly recommended her service."
"i've been getting my hair cut here by jie for almost a year now and she is always very professional and friendly.  my haircuts are quick, but excellent.  i am always warmly greeted by her and enjoy my haircuts here because of her."
"as a busy mom, i don't always have time and forethought to schedule an appointment with my regular hairdresser. two weeks ago, i had to get the back of my hair cut-- and i needed it done like, right now. i picked up my 11 year old after school, we dropped in without an appointment, and 20 minutes later, i was as happy as a clam!thank you sports clips for taking great care of me!"
"this shop rocks, friendly staff. ask for the mvp. i've been to other locations for my hair but no one had the patience like this sport clips did."
i check in online when in the neighborhood. i always have my haircut by jie. with the online app i know when she's there and how soon she'll be available. she always does a great job.
"i have a haircut with jie who is nice , and professional hair stylist. so she can design hair style what you want ."
haven't been able to get to this location again as it's quite a bit of a ways to go from my house for the haircut. all i can do say that the service is great. prices are in good standing. they attend you with the smile. they are even better than supercuts is all i can say. go try them out if you need the smooth haircut for your interview look as your very stunning haircut counts for the job hunting.
awesome place to go to for men nd boys of any age.  get ur mvp experience it's like nothing uve experienced. great stylist waiting for you.
jie was soooo good. she gave me great input about how to care for my hair and gave me a great cut!
was looking for a new place to get my hair cut so figured i would try it out. asked for something simply and my hair was uneven. very disappointed especially for the price. will not be back. guess it is back to supercuts.
"i have been coming to this sports clips for years. after my favorite barber passed away in south pas. i just stumbled into this place and i am so glad i did. these guys get it right every time. they mix it up and change up styles and always impress. they are fun to talk to and the mvp service is the best service i have experienced in a hair parlor. after i moved out of the neighborhood, you would think that i would find a closer spot right? nope. i still come back to south pas sports clips! special shout out to victoria and jie! they are always the best!!"
just found this place it's awesome.  you get a little massage with your hair wash. and a great cut by friendly people. annie was great. if you like sports its all over the place.  go you won't be sorry.
"updated my review because of time and attentiveness of jon and jie.  :)today i came in to get my haircut from last week fixed (missed spots in back, side and front).  wrote an honest review of my recent experience and was responded to quickly, which i truly appreciate, and tells they value their customers!!!last week i came in during happy hour, so my mvp came down from $27 to $23; that was a  nice surprise.  she missed several spots and i didn't get the neck and shoulder massage, that's not a nice surprise.jie not only fixed up the areas around the side that were missed, as well as the spots on top that were missed, but also pointed out a spot in back i didn't see where there was a (not quite) bald spot where the stylist had gotten a little too close with the clippers.jie did a great job making it right!!!  victoria is my regular here (and no she is not the one who messed up).  i highly recommend either jie or victoria."
shout out to lina who was very patient and communicative when cutting my hair and gave very nice recommendations. my always go to stop for a no nonsense haircut!
been going here for a year now.  service always friendly and jie gives the best hair cuts.
"jie is the best! i've been coming here for over a year and have found jie to be outstanding at understanding my haircut needs (my hair is really hard to make look good, but she does) and delivering a consistent cut. i have had good experiences with the rest of the staff, too, but have found her to be the best at delivering what i'm looking for.kudos to the rest of the staff for being friendly, welcoming and keeping the place clean and inviting!"
"i've been coming here for years, and i have to say i've seen a significant improvement under the new ownership.mila has done a great job every time of remembering how i like my hair, and her great service will keep me coming back."
"i just needed a cut, and my regular barber had a huge line. so thought i'd stop in here.....mistake!!!i am an easy cut, usually 10 minutes tops in a barber chair. clippers, 3 on top, 2 on sides, 1 around the edges, square. very common casual cut.i was assigned to edna. when i told her ""3,2,1, tapered square"", she said what's that? then fumbled with different buzzer guards.when all was done, it wasn't a 3,2,1. it was a mess, an extra notch cut into front of my hairline,  and no discernible style.... just a little shorter.  when she said ""this was my first time with this"" i couldn't tell if she was kidding or confessing.avoiding in future!!  :-("
"i am 75 years old,  and i just got the very best haircut i have ever had in my life!   yevette was my stylist,  and i highly recommend her.   she is really skillful with a scissors cut, and my hair looks great! it goes wherei want it to go with a comb or with my fingers.   yevette usually works in the noho sport clips.  you can ask for her there.   since it was my first time, i got the mvp treatment. which included a shampoo, facial spa,  and shoulder massage.  these are all included in the mtw discount price before 3 pm."
they rarely cut hair evenly. the only reason i go every now and again is because it's fast and convenient
do not get mila! she did a great haircut but made my neck bleed like crazy! a pair of clippers are not meant to make a person bleed. she also played it off like it happens all the time and was no big deal. she continued to try and up-sell me on products and refused to give me a discount for my troubles. it's a haircut for goodness sake....
best experience of my life with delisa.  great haircut...and the hot and cold face towel massage is the best!you must go for the experience.
"under new ownership and management. great place to come for a good quality haircut at a reasonable price and you get to watch sports to! clean barbershop, friendly staff, don't forget to try the mvp upgrade! all of the stylist are wonderful and do amazing work!"
"i stopped by a local barber shop and was greeted only with ""do you have an appointment?"". well, no. i had a last minute break in my schedule, and just wanted a cut. i was subsequently turned away. soon after remembered seeing a sport clips here in encino. i stopped in. was greated immediately. i apologized for not having an appointment, but asked if i could be fit in. the barber gus told me there's no need for an appointment, and by all means he'd get me in. soon after i was in the chair, and gus went to work. gus did a fantastic job!  i hardly had to tell him how i liked it. once he got the gist, he knew what to do. that's rare. he offered me a special that included a package of cuts, and vip treatment including hot towel service, massage and shampoo. pleased with the service, and the package being reasonably priced, i bought it. i've returned since, and of course asked for my man gus. couldn't be happier!  great job!"
christine gave me a great cut. she is fast and does a good job. they texted me when it was my time and did not have to wait.
"if you go to sports clips encino, you need to go to gus, he is the best. i have been requesting to have him cut my hair for over 10 visits now and he is consistent and amazing.  gus is the man to go to!"
"imagine finding out you can watch sports and do a mundane monthly task like get a haircut. well this is the place.i have been going to this location for about 6 months now and there was a 50/50 chance i would have a terrible experience. from wacky hours to not having enough stylists on the floor. but i kept coming back because the quality and the environment was pleasant if i was actually able to get a haircut. so as normal today, i called ahead to check if they were even open, and was pleasantly surprised that they have new ownership and management.the lady on the phone was extremely polite and enthusiastic and made sure to inform me of new features (like their new online check in prior to arriving)  and the new store hours (happy to hear they are open everyday now and have longer hours).when i arrived i was expecting my usual of 10 minutes standing around till someone noticed me and was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by a very nice and enthusiastic employee who smiled and raised her hands out of excitement like as if we had just won the lottery. (definitely makes someone smile after dealing with the traffic of living in los angeles) haircut was amazing as always! very happy with the changes the store has introduced and wanted to post this review so people knew that there is new management and all those old bad reviews are irrelevant."
"came in on sunday morning. only two stylists working and waited over 30 minutes! staffing issues perhaps?once i sat down the stylist was pleasant enough and i liked my haircut. will try another location though next time perhaps unless i have a lot of time to kill, which is basically never."
my second time here and i will definitely go back for future haircuts. delisa helped me with my haircut. she patiently listened as i explained what i'm looking for. she did an excellent job cutting and styling my hair exactly as i wanted. i got a lot of compliments afterward! highly recommend this place.
best cut ever! you can really tell the difference with the new manager and owners- i love being greeted as soon as i walk in with my boys- this time i had my hair there too by delisa and i can't tell you how happy i am- no more long waits with hairdressers that think they're doing you a favor by cutting your hair- and the mvp is beyond the most relaxing part!! go there now!! and ask for delisa
"came here on a lazy friday off, and glad i did! i did have to wait about 10-15 minutes because there were only two stylists, but not a big deal to me.my stylist lily was great, asked me what i wanted and took her time with a great cut and mvp deal. i definitely didn't feel like i was being rushed through; she was friendly and consistently made sure i liked where the cut was going.on top of all that, the first-tiner discount is great!  highly recommend."
"this is my first visit to this location. i was pleased to find out they service men and women along with kid. i was greeted by the staff who were all very friendly and,helped me with the new check in system. i received one of the best haircuts i have ever received from the new shop manager delisa. her attention to detail was amazing and her personality is so easy going and friendly. i got the mvp upgrade and love the massage chair and the hot towel. the tea tree smells good and is very relaxing. i highly recommend this shop and be sure to ask for delisa but i am sure all of the stylist are just as nice! the shop is in a great location to."
mila gave me a great haircut and was very sweet.  it was my first time at sport clips and i'll definitely be coming back.
"the new owners have really turned this place around! i used to go,  but just wasn't impressed ever. i saw that there were new owners and decided to give it another try and delisa was great! we had a great experience,  great cut,  and i'm really happy they have made so many changes."
i can always expect a great haircut and great service at this location. i've been coming to this sport clips for almost 3 years now. always friendly and clean. met the new manager on my recent trip. she was extremely helpful and kind. i will definitely be back soon.
first of all the shop is really clean and is a great place fornthe whole family. i went in to get a cut and was pleasantly greeted by delisa and chrisine. i did not wait more than 5 minutes before delisa sat me for me for my hair cut. absolutely loved what she did. i havent stopped getting compliments! i sent my mother in and she feels the same way. definitely bringing back the kids as they are huge sports fans and so glad we have finally found a place that suits us all.
i took my son for a first day of school haircut. they were fast friendly and affordable.  haircut was 24.00 plus tip.  will be coming back for sure.
"great friendly staff...walked in and was able to just check in on the computer they have upfront.  came in on a sunday and they were able to see me in less than 15 minutes.  one thing to keep in mind-  they don't do any sort of shaves, which i was a bit disappointed about.  all the folks there seem pretty friendly and do a decent job of cutting hair."
"i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this experience.  it was only slightly more expensive than other haircuts, but the services provided are way better.  i'm surely going to do this again."
"great place for a men's haircut.  as a first-timer, i got the vip service (free) including a trip to the body massage chair.  friendly atmosphere, reasonably priced and big screen tvs.  all that's missing is beer!"
"what's not to love??i've been coming to this sport clips for a little over a year now, and its been a great experience. i had never been to sport clips before this one opened up, and i'm very glad it did.all my life i had been getting my haircut at supercuts, and i even tried a pricey salon once to get my 'do. but i discovered sport clips and i've never been back. the season pass is a wise investment. you get 6 mvp haircuts for the price of 5 mvp cuts. $125 for 6 haircuts, complete with a blissful steamed towel, a massaging shampoo, and a shoulder massage. it's a steal, and they even let you come back for a neck trim for free, without an appointment, between cuts. i've had my hair cut about 10 times here, and each time has been pleasant. the staff is friendly, and its a lot of fun to watch sports while you get your hair cut. in the summer you can even do a cool towel instead of steamed. they also know men's hair, and are great at adjusting to your precise detailed style. parking here is a breeze, oh and they take notes on your haircut and keep them on file so you can come back and stick to what worked."
"this is an awesome place! my son and husband come here a lot, so i can see how great their hair look afterwards! i really enjoy this place and would recommend it to anyone."
"took my 2 boys, ages 6 & 9. both joon & katherine were great!  since it was our first visit, they got the mvp treatment for free (which they absolutely loved!).  took one star off because they don't take appointments, but we checked in and then walked over to chipotle for dinner since the wait was about an hour. so if you plan accordingly, it's not that big of a deal."
hands down... best experience! amazing service! jessica is amazing! my 7 year old immediately got in the car and told me to yelp her and to give her 5 stars!!!
"i have several complaints about my experience at this sports clip, the fact is that the hair stylist did an awesome job! professional, clean, and perhaps the best. i am overly critical of my hair cut and have not really been satisfied with a hair cut until today's date. and for all the cons to sports clip, they got this one right. congrats on the 5 stars!!"
"the fact there's no real appointment system is pretty lame. they're all about their walk-in deal, however multiple times i have tried to come in after work and forced to wait 45 minutes plus because of this. pretty annoying if you're in a hurry or you value your time. the atmosphere is really nice but sadly i won't be coming back because of this."
"first time at sportclips la canada and after having my hair cut to perfection by jenn, i will absolutely, hands down, be coming back. jenn was fabulous. professional and down to earth, i was very pleased with her suggestions for styling my hair and how thorough she was. after experimenting​ with another sportclips franchise in south pasadena for many months but never quite up to standards, i am confident that i have finally found a barber in jenn who knows how to cut and style my hair, the way i want it. no hassle. great experience all around."
"what a waste, drove 25 minutes to get there and they would not honor me and my boys, three new customers no expiration free haircut coupons. said they no longer accept free haircut coupons.we will never go back!"
"terrible service!    today was a typical busy sunday but that does not excuse not taking customers in order.  when we came in no one was at the front counter, so we put our name on the clipboard that was left at the front counter.  after waiting almost thirty minutes they took two customers who came in after we did.  when i asked why, ethan tells me they came in before us.  i informed him he was mistaken and our name was on the clip board. apparently he didn't check the clip board when he came back to the from to counter and entered other customers into the computer before us.   this is a terrible way to run a business and a bad way to treat customers.  if you want to patronize this establishment, make sure they get your name off the clip board after you sign in.   it's unacceptable to make us wait for four people who came in after we did (a single customer and a family of three)."
"came in to get a quick fade. unlike some other chains, they're always able to run with all my requests that i would normally reserve for a barber. whether it's some sort or fade, taper disconnected undercut they can do it.another thing is that it was a good hair cut and fast. i recommend jessica and elle."
first time customer saw it during world series game. went to try it out and had a great experience. justin cut my hair and you can tell he knew what he was doing from start to end. i got a free mvp upgrade since it was my first which saves me $5 so that was cool. it was very relaxing and i will defienetly go back.
"i work in finance and need a ""business cut"" about once a month to make sure i look neat and well groomed. i used to live in south pasadena where my basic haircut used to cost $35 at a salon frequented by more women than men. having just moved to the lacanada area, i looked very carefully for a new place for a haircut. i had never heard of sportclips before so i decided to give it a try. on my first visit, i made sure my iphone had photos of me with the haircut i wanted. (i thought that having these photos would be better than thumbing through magazines of male hair models looking for the style i wanted because, well, i'm just not one of those handsome hair model dudes.).  my first haircut was with inez. she offered me the mvp treatment which i, unfortunately, had to decline because i was pressed for time. ""no worries,"" she said cheerfully and offered to note in their records that i could avail of the free mvp treatment on any future visit. i enjoyed the haircut and was quite satisfied with the results. i decided that sportclips could by my new go-to place for haircuts.   i just went back there the other day for my second haircut in as many months. this time around theresa gave me a haircut. the experience was terrific, the cut was perfect, and i left looking handsomer than i was before my haircut. at least that's what my wife and daughter told me when i got home.  in summary, the haircuts are great. the sports magazines and the sports channels on the numerous tv monitors are a bonus. the prices are reasonable. i look forward to all my future visits to this place."
i have come here 3-4 times and brought my two sons also. you really have to time it or you'll wait a while. but they do a good job and they staff are very pleasant.they always seem a bit rushed so come on off hours.audree and bibi are gems!
"this place is great. theresa is amazing, nice, and helpful, running an efficient location. clean, quick, and kind. thank you."
"i've never written a review, and certainly have never given a poor review, but i'll make an exception for our last experience here. my son and i usually get mvps. i don't have a lot of time with all the kids'  sporting activities and this wednesday we arrived and there were four employees giving cuts to two customers. 15 minutes later those two customers were done and all four employees were watching as they were ringing up some kind of package for one of those earlier customers. another 20 minutes went by and no hair cuts for anyone, even with four available employees. we had to leave to get my son back him in time for bed without haircuts at all. miserable experience."
"customer service is awful. they don't care when you show up they take whoever they feel like. my son had been waiting for a haircut with me for 20 minutes, a bald man walks in (yes, bald men need haircuts too?) the woman at the counter says don't bother signing in i'll take you right now. this place offers a decent haircut for a kid but it comes at the price of dealing with people who don't care you're there."
"wanda was awesome! very helpful and knowledgeable on men's hair. i've been looking for someone that's good at there craft and she's got it down. thanks wanda, you rock. i will be back for sure!"
"one of the worst haircut experiences i've had. this is my third time here, and my last. i went in after already getting a buzz cut for the military because i needed some extra trimming attention around my ears. not only did they not offer a discounted price from a full haircut, but they made a big deal about asking. 3 coworkers in the store were involved in this conversation! i do give the person who cut my hair credit for giving me $5 off the full cut for being in the military, but asking for a 10/10 review kind of ruined that impression.i found the mvp treatment to be uncomfortable because the chair isn't very adjustable. there was a lot of pressure in my neck when i was laying my head back in the sink, and no amount of adjustment fixed that.definitely not a relaxing experience."
haircuts are good.  but!  i don't know why i have to enter all of my information in their screen every time i go in!  its especially annoying and really an invasion of privacy.  plus their computer is not easy to navigate and is frequently out of order.  if you do not enter your personal data you cannot get a haircut!i would give a higher rating if the streamlined their system!
"thanks for the recommendation to go to fantastic sam's on maxella!  by the way, very rude lady who refused service because she decided to close shop early (i arrived around 6:40pm when the closing time was 8).  she ended up saying fantastic sam's was open; glad they actually stick to their hours unlike this place, and service was so much better. last time i was here, this same lady was also very rude to her co-worker. it was clear she was the boss but i felt so bad!  one more thing, i dread coming here for haircuts. tools are dull and pulled out hair quite a few times.  a lot of room for improvement.  didn't want to leave a bad review bc i appreciate them being here as a last resort hair cut option for me, but the closing early... honestly just poor customer service and i want to give everyone the heads up not to make the same mistake i did."
"super rude large hispanic lady said her name was diane. went in there waited up front and tried to check in on ipad thing. she yells ""it doesn't work"" so i'm standing waiting to get my haircut and she says i have some one coming in. shes like next time you should call in. i just left."
"nice people, but they take forever.  i left my house on sunday at 11:15.  the place is 5 mins away so i arrived at 11:23 after parking.  just got home at 1:45 p.m.  unbelievable.  i would have rather given it a shot myself at home with my clippers."
"no exaggeration--worst haircut i've ever had. water and soap in my eyes during the ""wash"" and she said ""back to the chair"" without even drying my hair... had to ask for a towel to do it myself. and then the haircut you ask?! my dog could have done better with his claws. cuts all around my neck and it's completely uneven. don't go here."
"overpaid for a bad haircut.  asymmetric, and cut it way too short for my style in some spots yet weirdly left a lot of hair on top.  i've never had issues at other sport clips locations.  also, i think the clipper was dull/dirty because it was noisy and pulled on my hair sometimes. basically worst haircut ever. also, there's often only one person in here so the wait gets crazy.  trust me, it's not worth it."
just got done with a quick hair cut by agatha. she did a great job without any issues. i've had  pretty solid hair cuts from her as well as nazanin. i'm usually surprised that it's not busier. they don't hassle you here and expect you to get a hair wash like some other places.  plus they have big screen tv's with sports on it!  too bad no beer
"always a quick, great haircut. super close by which is anecdotal for me but makes it all the more convenient. the wait is rarely any more than 10 minutes and i've never had a bad haircut here in two years. i see nazanin typically on wed, she's amazing. definitely recommend."
"i like the vip , the cut,wash, massage is a great package. also i buy my shaping cream from you and it not only works great buy has a nice scent to it.diamond hooked up the cut.  i usually just go with whoever but now if she is there i would wait till she can take me.jason"
"i thought i'd try this new place out since a) it's near my office, and b) i've had a run of not so great cuts at my usual spot. plus they advertise as being sport-themed and having all the games on. i came in on a sat afternoon, taking one of the last spots on the ground level of the little parking lot (they have more spots underground). i've been to this shopping center before but never up to the 2nd floor so i had to look around a bit for the stairs--there's no signs. anyway, found them and went up. there were two customer in barber's chairs and one more who had walked in right before me, so not too crowded. i only waited a few minutes before being taken in. as a new customer, i was upgraded to the ""mvp"" package, which includes massage chair and shampoo and a neck massage on top of the haircut (a $5 value). all in all, got a decent cut, didn't take too long, and got to watch sports center all the while, for $20 plus tip. though i regretted not stopping in at costco beforehand--there's vouchers for free cuts on your first visit near the exit."
"when i walked into the shop the front desk person was sitting in the waiting area with her feet up. i was the only one there but still you'd think they'd at least anticipate business. i inquired about just getting the side of my head faded, nothing off the top, and they were going to charge me full price. i had a coupon but even with 5 dollars off it would have been more expensive than my usual barber (he charges $19.00 they wanted $24.00 post discount).the price isn't really her fault but when she told me that the hairstylist was in the back sleeping i turned tail and left. i'm not trying to have someone groggy go anywhere near my head with a blade. i don't know if they have a manager but if they do its obvious he/she isn't doing a great job."
"i gotta say that this place surprised me. i got a great cut at a great price! shout out to my girl nazcinin! she was awesome, even efficient, and i love my haircut!thanks :-) see you soon!"
got home to realize that my neck trim left a burn on my neck. guess the woman who cut my hair doesn't use clippers much. it's been a couple of days and it's still there. :-(
great haircut amazing service.  the staff was very friendly very clean location i would definitely return again
"i've tried to described what i want but the lady didn't seem to understand much english and i showed a photo and she said photos always help. i walked in with a long hair and was hoping to get out with short and decent hair. then she started cutting sides and they were so uneven. then she took me to hair wash and when i said aren't you going to cut the top part she said she is done. she was so rude during the whole time like pushing me around and stuff. i couldn't believe the whole thing and i just paid and left to make sure i don't walk out with a terrible hair. i've gone to a different place to finish my hair and they did a decent job. then i stopped by again and showed my hair and said this is what i wanted and she acted like she had no idea what's going on. she said ""did you style your hair and came back to show me how awesome it looks?"". i seriously couldn't believe the whole thing. i've put a complaint and a manager contacted me. i thought she'll offer a refund as they didn't do anything but she said she's sorry and she'll give me a free hair cut next time i go there. so our plan is to wait couple months until my hair grows so i can go there again to risk everything. i don't know if this was a one off stylist as when i went back the rest of the crew was super nice to me. but if you don't like taking risks on your hair, i'd suggest staying away from this place."
"can i give negative 5 stars??? do not go here. do not let ""navinine"" cut your hair! my poor son had the worst haircut of his life today. they must recruit dropouts or pay minimum wage because a simple kids haircut for a cooperative little guy turned out to be a complete nightmare. her hand shakes and she has zero skills as a hair stylist. she even has a tattoo of scissors on her arm ... so maybe in her younger years she used to be able to actually cut hair. stay far away!!!"
"diane has been cutting my hair for over a year now and i have been going to this sport clips location since i moved to marina del rey two years ago (i used to frequent the sport clips in burbank). what's not to like? there are barbers who are familiar with cutting guys hair, short waits, extra clean space, free parking, and shampoo/hot towel/massage (pro tip: get the mvp). added bonus for their call-ahead service and season pass plan. diane is consistent and quick and great to catch up with."
"the haircuts feel rushed and they end up looking rushed. it wasn't until i left this last time that i noticed a whole portion of my head hadn't been cut. decided i was not going to go back to have them fix it because more often than not i end up fixing my haircut from here with my own clippers at home anyways. my haircut is a simple buzz cut with two sizes and blended from the sides to the top, this should not be as difficult as they are making it look. the store is clean and overall service is decent, the only thing lacking is the quality of the haircuts."
"ask for elizabeth, she is a professional barber who takes great care with every haircut. i've been going to her for 2 years now and wouldn't imagine going to anyone else. she just recently transferred to this location from riveredge. i am willing to drive the extra 20 minutes to get a haircut from her"
"i have ha good hair cuts here. gary great. mickey great. nef. terrible. no idea how to cut men's hair. can't use clippers. uneven. missed areas. just terrible. if nef is on ask for someone else and look at the job she does on the people. try to no laugh out loud at them. they will be irregular, poorly faded, i give nef no stars. it's a shame she is there otherwise i would give 4-5 stars. remember if nef is working. avoid her or do go in on that day. you will regret it."
"sign outside said ""no wait"", go inside and nobody waiting but myself after signing in. one person cutting hair. waited an hour and had to leave as i am a human with responsibilities."
"just moved to nj from il and was looking for a haircut, found sport clips which was familiar to me and it was great, been growing my hair out for a year and wanted a new look.  jackie was great with some ideas and gave me a new look that i loved and got many compliments with. found a long time customer!"
"passed the location for a couple of years but always went to supercuts because that's what i always did. we were at a store near yours and decided to walk in. everyone was very friendly, the wait was minimal, my haircut was excellent and i will go to supercuts no more. you now have a loyal customer. the promotion for a first time customer was also a great plus!"
worst haircut i've ever had in my life and that's saying a lot considering i've experienced some pretty bad haircuts. do your hair a favor and avoid this place at all cost! the free haircut they offer to new customers is not worth it! i can tell the person cutting my hair was a rookie she had absolutely no idea what she was doing it was so bad i had to tell her to just stop cutting it. i cut it myself when i arrived home and somehow i managed to do a better job than them! i have no knowledge of cutting hair. that's just sad.
"friendly staff! no appointment needed! great hair cut, we'll be back :) great price (first cut free due to coupon, woohoo)"
"place went way down hill since paige left. had to leave and go to clean cut down the street. if you're an adult - go to clean cut. not only is it $7 cheaper, they're real barbers. sports clips is rookies who are learning."
"haircut was fine, but the price information is inaccurate. this is the most expensive haircut i've ever had, and i wish that the listing had shown that information, as it's hard to justify paying this much for the haircut i'm getting."
"i had my hair cut from heather and she did a good work. will be back for sure.edit :not worth it, have to pay $21 or more to get a hair cut. also every time there is different hair stylist and hair cut looks different."
"service was good and friendly.  however, after the first bad haircut i got there i decided to give them another chance.  no such luck.  another bad haircut.fool me once, shame on you.  fool me twice..."
best place to get a hair cut the manager heather is awesome been cutting my hair for 5 years great atmosphere tvs at every station with espn playing massage chairs to relax and the mvp package is worth every dollar
"this place is wonderful. after going the first 21 years of my life only receiving haircuts at home and then eventually done by myself, i decided to get a haircut at a professional hair cutter. i am so glad i decided to. if you are on the fence about going here, definitely give it a try. heather and sophie are both phenomenal hair cutters and people!!"
"both times i've been here, a great experience is an understatement. between the hairstylists engaging in conversation about work experiences and life, and the mvp experience was great. stylists know how to massage the scalp rather then just lathering shampoo. i'll definitely be back and recommend others to try!"
sports clips is my new friend. they know just how to treat a customer and you cant beat the mvp deal
"very attentive staff, especially heather.  go for the double or triple mvp.  very relaxing."
a few years ago i would have laughed at the idea of going to a chain for a hair cut but boy was i wrong. now years later this is my one and only go to. this is a great place for a great haircut. all of the girls are very friendly and very professional and they all know what they're doing. i've even tried other sports clips but none of them compare to the wyckoff store. i wish i was better at remembering names because there are a few girls that are definitely stand outs but they're all great so it doesn't really matter....regardless if they're all soulless evil people ;)
"i've been to the wyckoff sports clips three times and had a decent enough haircut each time for a fair price. the service is terrible, though. as others have said here, it takes forever even when they're not busy and the owner or manager (not sure which, but he's been there every time) is so rude i just don't want to give them my business. supercuts in waldwick does just as good a job for a comparable price and they're much more efficient and friendly."
"deceptive hours of operation...advertize as open until 8pm, but arrived at 745 with no one waiting and was told they were closed. very rude customer service to boot."
my boyfriend got his haircut here and was hesitant at first but figured he would give it a shot. well he loved it! the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is truly all about sports! he loved the haircut he was given and said he would definitely come back!
"best place for men & boys to get their haircuts!!! the staff is amazing and there seems to be no turnover of stylists! try the mvp service, it's very relaxing - you'll absolutely love sport clips wyckoff!"
"the first time i came here was a few years ago, when they first opened up. i decided to check it out because i had a free coupon. big mistake. they didn't know how to do a skin fade. but for a free haircut, i couldn't really complain. today i decided to subject myself to another bad experience, for some unknown reason. today's ""barber"" also did not know what a skin was. she took 5 minutes to discuss with another employee about what she should do. finally she decided to go with a zero and left me with a deep line on the side of my head, and asked ""how's that?"" after i realized she was actually being serious, i said ""can you fade it now?"" to which she responded with a frustrated sigh. i also told her i wanted to leave the top of my hair longer. to which she responded by continuing to cut off the top, saying ""i'm just evening it out."" i came home and looked in the mirror, and i look like quasimodo. good thing i declined the ""free mvp upgrade"" offer. god knows what she would have done to me during a ""massage""."
"brother and fiancé love getting their haircuts here. very busy, but worth the wait. stylists are great! sports everywhere. get the mvp!!"
"i've been bringing my kids there for years, shannon is great! the place is always clean and my boys always leave looking great!"
"so i get there shortly before 6pm to get a no. 1 which takes no more then 5 minutes and the owner tells me that their cut off for walk-ins is 5:30. well, then don't post that you are open until 6pm. when i told him that its not a smart business decision he got in my face (literally) and called me profanities. one of the girls had to come out and stop him otherwise he may have hit me. needless to say i am not going back there. the last two times i went there, i didn't think it was that great and you find better deals at other chain haircut places anyway."
eh...the franchise idea is great.  tv's and sports stuff everywhere. service is painfully slow. the hair cutting staff (all young girls) are energetic and friendly. but they tend to yak with one another while there are 6 people waiting for haircuts. brought my son and waited more than 40 minutes.  there were 2 or 3 chairs open several times while the girls socialized. steve the owner is there often and nice but he is constantly training the girls while people are waiting making it take longer than necessary.  get it together guys.
"been here 3 times.  there is often a wait and doesn't seem to be staffed enough.  for a place that caters to men with a sports theme, there sure are a lot of kids and i've been stuck behind waiting for them to get done 2 or 3 at a time.  i doubt i'll go back again."
"donna was great! this was my first time at sportsclips, i'm a barber / owner myself and had a great conversation with donna, not to mention she did exceptionally well giving me a fresh bald head! i got a free mvp service because it was my first time."
the stylists know what they're doing! most stylists are personable. i always get the haircut i ask for.
fast & convenient haircut. friendly environment.
"i've been coming to sports clips for almost two years. the only stylist i will allow to cut my hair is alyssa! she remembers my style, our last conversations and is always has a smile on her face!  thank you alyssa!!!"
great staff and facilities are new and clean.  tvs everywhere.  only place i like to get my hair cut.
got a haircut from alyssa. very curt and rough moving my head. it felt like i was doing her a favor. time to upgrade somewhere else.
"melissa is the best hair stylist/barber, bar none. she is passionate about her work and is extremely detail oriented. melissa listens to you and factors in your features and hair growth pattern to give you a cut that perfectly frames your face. without a doubt, she will give you the freshest cut you've ever had - every time!fyi, i stopped going to the edgewater sports clips over a year ago. between the same sports updates blaring over and over, the cheesy gear and the gimmicky theme, they're lucky i tried them 3x (back when they 1st opened). although i appreciate not missing the game while getting a haircut, all the stylists seemed bored to be there and subsequently gave terrible haircuts, so i wrote the place off. however, i came back because i heard melissa left super cuts in fort lee and was now at the edgewater sports clips. i'm told they have a completely new staff equal to melissa's caliber, so if you tried it before, give sports clips another shot."
alyssa is awesome! she makes a serious effort in making sure you get what you're asking for. best hair stylist i've ever come across.
"avoid this place if you want a good haircut! out of the 4 hair cuts i've gotten here they've either been less-than-satisfactory or worse. today i got a haircut there and i noticed the lady ran the razor too deep in the back/side. got a nice little bald spot. and this isn't the first time! a few months ago a different older lady cutting my hair left it with like 3 or 4 little razor slips/bald spots on the side of my head. unbelievable. are the employees even trained to cut hair or are they just careless? oh, and the way the employees forcibly greet you and everybody who enters is so cheesy, monotoned, and robotic. leaves you feeling awkward ""welcome to sportsclips""....i blame management and the business, no offense to the employees. either way, never going to sportclips again and i advise no one else too either. i was too nice to give this place my hard earned money after the first bad haircut. it's unprofessional, low quality service, and just bad. find a real barber/salon!"
"this review is not for sports clips in general but their stylist jen - i actually liked the atmosphere, the tvs, and all since it was my first time coming there.unfortunately, i had some grandma that said she can do what i ask to cut my hair. wrong.i told her i want a low fade and she wants to tell me i have a high fade.i told her to trim the top, half an inch, she cuts off like 3 inches. i specifically told her that i like my hair curly and to the back and now my hair isn't long enough to be curly and she combs it to the front or something.i would love to come back but she pissed me off too much. if you go here, make sure you ask for anyone but jen."
"this rating is a reflection of their customer service, particularly the managerial staff.i received 2 coupons for a free haircut at a promotional event. i planned to use them for my children. prior to my visit, i called to see if they cut girls hair, and i was told they do, but they do not do blow outs. fine, not a problem.when we arrived, we were immediately greeted by the assistant manager. i showed her the coupons prior to the haircuts, and she acknowledged them without a problem.my son was taken first, without waiting, by a lovely woman. a few minutes later, my daughter was taken by the assistant manager. as the assistant manager was walking, the manager quietly said something to her, that i could not here.once the haircuts were done, i went to settle the bill with the assistant manager. it was then that she told me there was an add on fee ""for length"" that was not included in the coupon. the manager came over when i began to question why this was not told to me prior to the haircut. i asked if the coupon states anything about add ons not being covered - it does not. i asked it there are any signs posted about add ons on their walls on the price list - there was not. i explained that that is a very poor business practice to slap on fees that are not posted after providing a service. the manager would not budge on the fee, and stated that she said something about it prior to the haircut. i told her that she did not speak to me prior to the cut, she spoke to the staff member. her response was, ""but you watched me speak to her"". so she assumed that i heard her conversation with someone else, instead of speaking directly to me.all in all my son loved his hair cut, and my daughters was a simple trim. the place was clean, but after the experience with the manager, i would not return."
"great experience and haircut. get to watch sports and a top notch, very detailed, haircut service. complete with shampoo and scalp/neck massage! 10 out of 10!"
"so far, my visits have been awesome. i usually do my cuts with paula or chloe, two very good and awesome ladies (highly recommend). i always do the mvp, and they certainly love what they do. i don't think i've seen anyone not in a good mood there....did i mention they are very accommodating with my work schedule?? even though it's a chain, they make you feel like it's a mom & pops barbershop. definitely recommended!!"
"usually quick to get me into a chair and quick to get me out, with very little chit-chat, and consistent results."
"it's just a lot of fun  getting a haircut/style while watching your favorite sporting event on wide hd screens like a sports bar.  a fade and the world cup 2014...service was very friendly, and the stylist and manager (same person) gave me exactly what i requested. this is my new spot! sports bar meets hair salon (without food and drink) love the spin on it! oh yeah, the chair they use to wash your hair is also a massage chair!! i recommend their vip package. a+"
"i just came back from getting a hair cut at this location and it was the single worst experience i have ever had in professionalism and customer service. i have been to another sportsclips and had an excellent experience. at the original sportsclip i was told that my haircut preference would be kept on file so that if i went to any other sportsclip my information would be in the system. when i entered the edgewater location i was told that they do not keep information on file here. i said fine -- no biggie-- i will just explain how i would like it. there  was no one in the waiting area when i got there, and 2 others in chairs being serviced. after waiting forty minutes for the woman to give the man in front of me a short trim  i was ready to get my haircut. but three other people walked in and were serviced before me!!!! when i pointed out that i had been there almost an hour waiting for a haircut after i had been told my wait time would be 10 minutes the man in charge apologized and said the customers who walked in had stopped by earlier and left because of the wait time so they deserved to go first. wth?? finally, after over an hour of waiting for a buzz cut it was my turn. the woman cutting my hair had no idea what she was doing. i now look like a lego man because she did not fade my hair --- she attempted to make it all the same length. unfortunately she was so awful that she missed areas and it is an incredibly uneven haircut. when i walked into my home, before i could even explain my experience to my girlfriend, she remarks ""that haircut is awful -- tell me you did not pay money for that!""never go to this location!! be warned this is a pricey place for an awful haircut and an even worse experience."
"we brought our son here for his first real hair cut and it was such a great experience. we had two lovely women helping keep him distracted and entertained while he got his trim. he was upset at first, but they calmed him down quickly and were so good with him (and his nervous mother). luckily, there is enough going on with tvs and hair dryers, etc., that he didn't seem to bother the other guests when he was fussing at first - but the staff was obviously keeping him happy for more than just our benefit.  it was all around great customer service.  and his hair cut came out great even though he's young and small and wasn't exactly sitting still.  the salon is also very bright, clean, and true to the sports theme.  can't say enough about how happy we were with our visit."
quick convenient and inexpensive! great with kids. good location and lots of parking.
"wanted to try a new place for my haircut and have seen ads for this place for awhile now. just got back about 30 mins ago from my appointment and i wanted to make sure i shared my experience. first, the online check-in is a must! this saved me so much time, by the time i got there i was 2nd on line, the place was packed and saved me so much waiting time.my stylist was ella, she was very friendly, and professional, worked with me to find my proper number and to make sure i was satisfied with everything she did, she also walked me through every step to make me feel more comfortable. because it was my first time, i got my hair cut, hot towel, shampoo, and neck and back massage for a great value price of $20! i will definitely be back again, a great experience and a great hair cut!"
people that cut your hair there thinks they are doing you a favor ! my wife brought my son there to cut his hair they waited 45 minutes and the lady remember him not sitting on his chair she gave excuses not to cut his hair ! if you didn't wanted cut his hair you should of said so from the beginning.not make the customer wait 45 minutes and give excuses that it's not safe and stuff very bad staff and rude !! never will go back again !!
"octavia was great with my son. however, i would suggest against this business if your children are autistic or have other disabilities. the online checkin helps with my son because he can get overwhelmed in large groups. once we checked in he was first in line. 2 people were taken ahead of him and one person wasn't even asked if they were next, they just walked into the cutters seat. like i said octavia is the only name i know because she helped my son out, the other 2 were very unprofessional and poor examples of whatever policy the corporation has."
"christina is awesome, her haircuts are one point and she's got a great sense of humor. prices are fair and little wait time, not sure about the sports viewing as we never wait long enough to catch a game. ask for chris or christina!"
go to cristina! she's amazing!!! mvp is a nice addition with the massage and hair shampoo. there's usually no wait and the checkin process is via self-check-in.
"stopped by here because i have an interview on monday so i needed a trim and my usual guy is on vacation. upon walking in i was pleasantly surprised at the layout.  the space is very clean (the location is only 4 months old)large screen tv's are everywhere and it felt a bit overdone with the sports theme.  granted i'm not a sports guy so take that as you may.  i was here for a haircut.you don't need an appointment as it's walk-ins only.  this again was good news.  i was paired up with a young lady named dani.  she was exceedingly friendly and although i'm not a talker she tried very hard to make conversation.  upon entering the chair she asked me what do i want to have done today.  i replied a trim.  now here's where i think things went very wrong.  my thought is this:  if someone walks in and asks for a trim they are essentially asking for the barber to remove hair in proportion to maintain the overall appearance of the current hairstyle.  i was alone in this thought as i soon found out.she asked my for my number referring to the shaving adapter size.  most guys may know this information but i did not.   it was clear by her nonverbal feedback that i should have this information.  we decided to learn together and tried a size 3 first. only she had it on 3.5.  then we went to size 3, then finally agreed on size 2. so she went to work buzzing away. i'm not trying to be picky but i could tell by how rough she was and her overall technique that this wasn't going to end well.  then came a brief haircut.  the haircut i received was unbelievably bad.  she masked the butchery she committed on the back of my head by hold the mirror at angle that i couldn't see how uneven the back was. she left enough water on my hair so that i couldn't see how uneven the front was.  the final insult came as she was taking off the gown and dumped all my hair back onto me.  then she took a hairdryer and blew what she could off. totally backwards. klutz.i left knowing that i wouldn't be back ever, but i had no idea how bad it was until i got homeso bad i can only post pictures.  for 18 bucks you should be able to provide a decent haircut.  bottom line : i'm not coming back here ever again but if you get your hair buzzed on all sides then this might work for you.  but so would a flowbee.  if you do go here i think its a roll of the dice at best.  avoid dani.zero stars."
"was skeptical initially to change my barber, but gave a try and loved my haircut. ask for christy! that sweetheart knows what you want. interior is nice, the process of checkin in convenient!will come back!"
"about 2 weeks ago i went into sport clips and met julia who, quite frankly, gave me the best haircut i can remember.i mean absolutely perfect. i had a barber that is no longer able to cut hair that i went to for over 12 years; for the past two years i've been struggling to find someone who can cut my hair in the way which i want it. perhaps it's my fault for not explaining what i want but until now i've not been happy with any cut that i have gotten.julia broke that cycle and did an absolutely fantastic job, she's an absolute asset to your company and i can't thank her enough."
happened to go in by chance the staff was friendly the store was clean the wait time was a bit long could definitely use online reservation system i'll definitely give it another chance the haircut was decent
"first time to this store. not busy. very clean. stylist elizabeth was amazing. great conversation. talked about all products she used. and why she used them. if i'm back in this area, i will definitely go back."
amazing staff that will make you feel right at home while providing a flawless professional service.  these stylists really know what they are doing!!
"got a hair cut from angela this morning and could not be happier - fantastic service, excellent cut, everything was amazing!  if you are looking for a great cut at a reasonable price, look no further!"
for the first time in a very long time i got a haircut i i'm very satisfied with. i showed alyssa a picture of what i wanted and she gave me exactly that. it's low maintenance and stylish. will be back here for sure!
"please go to angela, she is the best with men's fade cuts. for 15 years i been getting fades and never allowed a women to do it until i found angela. she is really good at her craft and does a great job."
"great atmosphere, excellent service and great haircuts. the price isn't bad either (they offer coupons/discounts/birthday-extras). convenient with hours, clean, and cool with the tvs. i also highly recommend the mvp, it's free with the haircut for first time clients. its so relaxing, not only did you get a great cut, afterwards you receive a relaxing scalp massage shampoo with a hot steamed towel while sitting a leather massaging chair, then the stylist dries&cleans you up followed with a neck&shoulder massage finish. which the stylist discusses products best for your hair and plan next visit. overall a great experience when you just need to relax for 20-30 of your day!"
"my barber retired after 25 some odd years, so where do you find someone that is willing to cut whatever it is i have left on the top of my dome. i'm not fancy by any stretch of the imagination when it comes to hairstyle, i'm just thankful i have something to cut. it is true that they need to get their act together in some respect of customer interaction, but the people i've dealt with there have been nothing but friendly. i sat down there for the first time telling the stylist that i had no idea what the barber did and she was willing to work with me and without any type of attitude. there were other people in there at the time that were giving another stylist a really hard time to the point where i started to feel bad. however, when you have 10 kids running around a joint without proper parental supervision, i'd be cranky and want to stab someone in the eye and or neck with a pointed implement."
tried this place for the 1st time yesterday after a bad experience with city looks down the road. wait time was reasonable - 10 minutes. although it was a slow time in middle of week day afternoon. katie was my hair cutter and understood exactly what i wanted.  she handled scissors expertly and cleaned up my last bad haircut. came out just the right length and even. that's all i ask for. good job.
"i have taken my son to many barbers in cranford, union, and garwood over the past 13 years and every time, the barbers would cut it incorrectly, there were always stray long hairs, or it would look terrible after waiting up to an hour.we finally found someone that cuts his hair perfectly every time. i think this was his 5th haircut with norma. norma, at sport clips in the garwood plaza is the best! i think we waited a half hour once, but who cares; she's worth the wait.i almost don't want to write the review in fear of not being able to get an appointment!  norma takes her time and even took notes as to how my son likes his hair. norma even recommended his cut last time. norma is awesome! this is the only place i will take my son from now on!thank you norma!ps. do not let her go pete"
i have been to several sport clips and this is the worst one yet.  the cut itself was okay not great but my hair is pretty easy. my issue is that the stylist bruised my neck pretty bad with the clipper.  to make matters worse she played tricks with the mirror on the back of my neck to avoid me seeing the marks. it wasn't until i got home when i saw the damage.  it was bad and sore.  i called them the next day to discuss my dissatisfaction.  the person i spoke to took my name and number down and said the owner would call me.  this never happened.   i'm just glad i didn't take my son there.  we don't be back.
"we like this place because of the ease of having my son's hair cut- no appointment necessary, and the stylists always do a good job. we have never waited more than 5 minutes. the staff even takes notes as to how my son likes his hair. it is one of the less-pricey places as well and the staff are very friendly. we also like that you get 50% after 6 haircuts."
"my 8 year old son had a great experience with our new stylist. i forgot her name, but she has dark hair and has two kids-such a nice woman (i'll up date when i find her biz card). she was friendly (but not fake and over the top friendly), patient and was very skilled. she gave my son the mvp treatment--meaning after his hair cut, he was given a nice warm towel over his face, a gentle head and back massage. it's refreshing to find a genuine, not so in-your-face stylist who doesn't rush cutting when dealing with kids. he loved being treated like a big kid. and his hair looks so awesome. all of our friends and family keep complimenting his new 'do. so happy we finally have to place to continuously bring (the male side of) family.  seriously now, i don't have need to be a hair salon slut anymore--i think we found the right place and stylist for male haircuts!"
"haircuts here are consistently of high quality. i have never been disappointed. if i wanted an alteration afterward for my personal preference, they happily accommodated my request."
"the good: i want to like this place, i really do!  for the second sunday in a span of two months i've taken my 5 year old for a cut at sports clips garwood.  the atmosphere is great for a 5 year old boy, especially on a sunday with football.  unfortunately that's about where the positive reviews end.  the not so good:we've had ""ok"" haircuts here.  if you have children unfortunately if you don't stand over the stylist she will likely not cut the way you asked her to prior to beginning the cut.this is the most painful part of the experience, the staff is insanely, insanely slow.  no one greets you when you walk in, you just need to know that you have to place your name on a sign up sheet at the desk.  it literally takes about 45-50 minutes for the staff to get through one customer, clean the station and prep for the next customer on the list.  many times customers/parents will pay for the ""mvp"" which only prolongs the process.  one of the two stylists then disappears for about 5-10 minutes in between each cut only exacerbating the situation.  in the 8-10 times i've been to sports clips garwood (both on the weekends and during the week) i've never once seen the owner.customer feedback:my advice to the owner is to spend a sunday at your establishment and reevaluate your staff.  you may also want to add another stylist on weekends.  currently you need it, but if you continue down this path you won't soon enough.my children and i won't be returning.  you've lost a customer and positive word of mouth within my social media circle."
"my son and i have been going there since it opened. he always went to jess but she doesnt work there anymore. my son had a signature mowhawk that was his good luck charm for basketball and football, until nicole shaved it off. nicole greeted us, went over his haircut, lengths of razor clips, how he styles it and how long the top should be. then, sat him down and shaved it off. when i got upset over it, nicole told him ""all the kids wear it like this now"". well, the cool thing was that he didnt want to be the other kids. hair grows back, its not the end of the world, but running a business is about listening to the client. if you go, explain what you want and keep an eye on them."
"friendly, talented staff, haircut done in a timely manor w/attention to detail, clean store, & treated like an mvp."
"cristina is an amazing barber! she's extremely attentive and easy to talk to.  i like my hair a specific way and she will make sure to take her time and get every detail correct.  this is within a complex off of route 17 (next to the tesla dealership) and has lots of parking.  easy to get off and on 17, and there's a pizza restaurant next door."
"this is my second visit to a sports clips (i've been to the one in oakland where my haircut felt a bit rushed and sloppy) so i was hoping that this experience would be a bit better.when i came in, i was immediately greeted by one of the barbers/stylists. they were super friendly and welcoming and directed me to the tablet in front of me to register. i didn't mind doing this but i could see how it could be annoying if you didn't want to give them your information.i was walked along to one of the empty chairs on the right side where a soccer match was on. on my previous visit, i was asked if there were anything specific i wanted to watch but not this time (not a big issue but it would've been nice). even though the place was less than half full, the cut did feel a bit rushed. they upgraded me to the mvp treatment for free (hair wash, machine massage, chair massage) but i think that if offered it again, i'd decline it. my barber got shampoo in my ears and didn't dry my hair well. she also didn't wipe my face right away after getting some hair near my mouth (i had to request it). the barber was really nice but she left a few split ends and the cut was slightly uneven. i'm not sure if it's just a coincidence or maybe the people working at all sports clips are unhappy about the job (i wouldn't want to massage people either) but each time i've gone to one i felt like i should've gone to supercuts instead or even the salon school."
great place for a cut. they have specials so be on the lookout for that. it's a true hidden gem. all the stylists are top notch.
"checked in online for my 2 sons- 2pm. sportclips website states 104min wait & suggests arrival of 3:44pm. while i had never been to sportclips, i knew it was in vicinity of paramus park. we head over to mall to pass the long wait before our ""appointment."" around 3:35, i call sport clips and inquire, ""on my way over, what landmark on rt. 17 n are you near?"" and ""i'm coming from paramus park, are you north or south of the mall?"" sports clips states, ""south"". she furthers, ""we're in vitamin shoppe strip mall just south of paramus park."" so, i head onto 17s and start looking on the n side for the place where i will be making a u-turn. drive all the way down past gsp and realize the girl was wrong, this place can't be south of the mall, because i'm no longer even in paramus. what i am in, in terrible parking lot-like traffic on good friday. i head north and kill the next 20 minutes in hardly moving traffic, looking for this place, only to find it eventually just north of paramus park, right where i was when i phoned the store and was told to drive south! i finally head in at 4:02pm. there are 2 stylists, each in the middle of a haircut, and an electronic board on the wall with 2 names waiting. neither were the names of my kids. a stylist looks at me and asks me to check in at the kiosk. i then explain that i've already checked in 2 hours ago, and i'm surprised i don't see my kids names on the board. i show her my cell phone screenshot which says arrival of 3:44pm. she says ""just check in again here."" i do so, and the store kiosk states 56 minutes!!!!! i exclaim,""you're not going to make me wait another hour siting here are you?"" ""are we at least going to be next?"" she states, ""well, if you don't get here within 30 minutes of your suggested time, the system removes you from the queue."" i state, ""but it hasn't been 30 minutes. it's only 4:02! why is my name no longer on the board?"" she has no answer. so, again i ask, ""if i wait here, will we be next?"" she says ""yes."" i also explained that i had recently called, and had she known the difference between north and south, i would have taken 17n in the first place and arrived in plenty of time for my 3:44 appointment! i now wait another 15 minutes for one of the 2 stylists to finish the client she's working on, and then she approaches the reception area and takes another person before us! absolutely amazing! just the stupidest employees and worst customer service i've ever experienced. i will never frequent this nor any sports clips ever again!!! this store wasted a full 2 hours of my family's time on a holiday and never even apologized for their mistake! they didn't even offer to cut the children's hair for free or anything for their mistakes! i had to leave without getting the haircuts, as we had another obligation. the stylist wanted us to sit and wait another full hour after already waiting 2 before we walked in, and killing 20 minutes in rt17 traffic because she didn't know the direction of her own store. totally outrageous! oh, and the best part, the sign outside the door the whole time said ""0 minute wait!"" don't ever go here unless you feel like wasting your entire day, or have not a single thing in the world to do for the next 4 hours!"
"great team here, very friendly and welcoming !  they offer a really professional service but still make you feel right at home!"
"came in for a clean cut and beard trim. not a bad wait, as a walk in with only 2 guys ahead of me. got marty and i must say, he is the man. speedy and professional clean shave and shaped up the beard. went with the mvp treatment with a hot towel on the massage chair, then shampoo, followed by a cold towel. nice experience and will definitely be back"
"the hair cuts were average at best, but last i week had what was arguably the worst haircut i've ever had. i am pretty sure i may have been one her first clients- ever..i would like to keep coming back, but i won't be back until i hear the talent has gotten better."
seriously?! who taught you how to cut hair?! this is how you cut around ears? you remove an inch and a half of hair? picture speaks a thousand words. save your money & aggravation. go somewhere else.
best haircuts in town. service is also great and everybody is really nice in there. 5/5
"good value for your money, only slightly more $ than supercuts.  my hairstylist emily was excellent and did a very thorough and complete job.  i got the mvp which includes the cut, hot towel, shoulder and scalp massage.  everyone there was very friendly, if you have a coupon, definitely go in july!"
nikki was wonderful with the cut and the gesture.the place is clean and the staff is very professional and courteous.definitely recommend
"what a joke online check in is.  scheduled myself well in advance and arrived at the time i was instructed , to then find out i had another 20 minute wait.  the worst part is that had i walked in without the online reservation, my wait time would have been less.why bother with an online system that creates a crappier customer experience?  sports clips should consider providing a discount if they are not able to meet the expectation of the service they provide."
"entire staff is friendly and helpful. i went in not expecting much, but got the best haircut of my life by kimberly. you have a customer for life. thank you! highly recommended."
my son had the best haircut ever here.  nicci cut his hair and it was perfect.
i have been taking my 2 kids here for over a year. we miss lauren. bria has been doing cuts for last 2 months and does a great job and very friendly
3 out of 4 haircuts were bad... this last time they were watching the news instead of espn or sports. i'll be going to warren's sports clips from now on.
i brought my 15 year old son here for a haircut. my son doesn't usually like to get his hair cut but he loved the cool atmosphere and more importantly he left with a great haircut! we will definitely be back.
"consistently good haircuts, consistently great (and friendly) service. highly recommend."
"clean, neat, organized, attentive and skilled staff, just opened in december. great haircut for men of all ages and looks. made to be like a sports lounge/locker room with lots of sports and tvs. discounts and deals for kids, senior citizens and first-time customers. you can come in between haircuts for a neck and sideburn trim/touch-up for free. my hair stylist, patrice, was excellent. it's the best haircut i've had in a long time. i would highly recommend."
"worst haircut ever. waited for 15 minutes which was fine. but the woman who cut my hair needs to go back to school. the ""line up"" they offer is barely a shapeup. not happy."
got back for a free hair cut for my son with the manager and i am very happy with it. glad i gave them a second chance. will be back again.
"no appointment necessary.  professional, and reasonable prices.  go for the mvp with hot towel and scalp/shoulder massage."
bringing my boyfriend he loves the pretty hair cutters the sports tvs and the decent pricing
unorganized and unprepared. sunday and the only option that is open. two people on staff as barber and no receptionist. a room full of potential clients waiting patiently but with no information. after waiting a half hour and only one client turnover i had to walk out. if they had more people on staff they might be able to gain clients.
"not many hair cutters can pull off a decent flat top, but sidney is an exception and this review is about her.  for a young lady with not many years of experience she does an exceptional job.  she is pleasant and very knowledgable about her craft.  if you want a real treat, upgrade your visit to an mvp and enjoy the treatment she provides."
"the experience is always pleasant and i have never had a bad haircut from any of the stylist. i was just recently at the wall, nj store and maria did an excellent job. i really didn't have to say much and she was very efficient with her work. i am pretty picky on how i like my hair cut because my mother always was a perfectionist. thank you for your excellent service."
"at a very reasonable cost, and with no appointment necessary, i got a great haircut! i am extremely particular about my hair and usually get very nervous when in the chair, but i walked out with a cut as good as any posh salon-with out dropping $60+ thank you gabby!"
"well i tried again, and another service fail.  i walked in, and everyone was busy so i signed in. after sitting for a while, one of the stylists finished and was at the register when two people walked in.  apparently, she did not check the sign in sheet and entered the two new people into the computer. after a half hour, the person after me was called in next, and i had say that they missed my name.  exact thing happened on my last trip.  their procedures stink, and i hate having to always correct the order.  guess i need to find a new place."
great place to get a boy's buzz cut. my son has autism and haircuts have always been a challenge for him with his sensory and communication issues. the ladies here have been awesome with him and he's now completely comfortable and at ease getting it done with them.
service was excellent and coupon for free cut was very welcomed.
"everything. haircut was awesome, along with the massage. thanks emily!"
"this hair shop is only for men and the hairdressers are obviously well versed in men's cuts! my son got the best cut ever here! he is very happy with it as am i! i had to suffer through football playing on all the flat screen tvs in the reception area and at each station! but sports fans will just love this place! there are different packages you can select (including a neck massage) and the prices are good.   i also signed up to get email coupons. great, friendly service - hands down - new place for my sons cuts!!!!"
this place is the worst!!!!!!!   i would really like to know if everyone there are actually licensed.  they did a terrible job on my grandsons hair.  it looked chopped like a child did it themselves. not only did she know she did a bad job she was rude and went in the back room and left it to another person to deal with.  i had to go somewhere else to try and fix it. the only thing left that could be done was buzz cut which i specifically did not want done and told her that from the very beginning   i will be notifying the better business bureau
good place for a fast cut!  employees are nice and the mvp is a nice touch! i recommend melinda!

"treated my father to a glow-up here yesterday. stephanie did an excellent job cleaning him up. you could tell she knew what she was doing and she asked a lot of questions to make sure that she was giving him the style that he wanted. the staff was very friendly, we were greeted right away and seen immediately. she made sure to give him some coupons for his next visit before we left."
"been a loyal customer for almost 2 years now. i go back because of the sports, the conversation, and the customer service. come here asap."
"worst haircut i've ever had. i would go back to parris island for 13 weeks for a haircut before i'd go back to sports clips.  the room is too dark to see how good they do, or in my case i missed how poorly it was cut.  since it was my first time there it came with everything including the shampoo and massage. the shampoo is the best part of a hair cut everywhere except here. the water was scalding hot, she tested how hot it was on my head instead of her hand. i tried reaching out to them and didn't hear back. i took their survey and never heard back. i sent them the pictures and nothing. it was just a terrible hair cut."
"did not listen to what i wanted.  specifically said, ""do not cut the front, i like the length.""  this was the last thing i said to her before she started.  she then proceeded to cut over an inch off the front of my hair, which forced me to completely change my hairstyle.  she wasn't even close to what i asked."
"i hate (b/c i dislike most sports and am a woman) this place but my son gets great cuts from this chain overall (one cut was too short and butchered at the deptford, nj, location . . . so much so that i told the woman at check out that i didn't want to pay . . . and i didn't! - only left a small tip for his hairdresser.)after a nice lunch at pasta pomodoro, i suggested an overdue haircut (trim!) for my son, aidan.  we went in and fortunately got crystal for his hairdresser.  i pre-cursor'd his cut with the above and she was careful to leave the top of his hair long.  she did a great job and my son loved/s the cut.  (he's not smiling in this pix b/c this was the 2nd shot i took b/c he blinked the first time ;)    aidan asked that we go back to crystal ""next time!"""
"i have been going to sports clips for years.  this location i have been going to since they opened.  last time i tried to go there i arrived at 10:05 and waited 15 minutes before i went up and tried the door and it was still locked.  the open sign was off as well. i even went as far to go onto the website and let them know that this happened.  i have had zero response from the store or from the organization.  you expect to be paid for your service, and as a customer i expect you to be open during the stated hours.  from now on i will go to the location in voorhees as the woman that owns this locations and the one i mt laurel will never get my business again"
"this place is a prime example of entitled hair stylist. the business opens at 10 am. i showed up at 12pm. there were 2 stylist working. the first one pulled me back and i said i wanted a ""0"" on the sides... she said i don't know how to do that. so i said, ok i'll wait for the other stylist. while i'm siting down i hear her say ""omg, i haven't eaten yet i need a break or i won't make it until 2pm"" what the hell... you're working 4 hours and you're stressing????? cutting guys hair???so when she found out that i basically had to go to this other stylist since i couldn't get a 0 on the sides from the other. she rushes my hair cut, didn't talk a word the whole time, and when it came to payment i didn't leave a tip, and she stated ""no tip, my day just got worse"" tips are for hark working employees not 4 hour shift brats. by the way her name was sam. stay away from her. laura is the one that doesn't know how to do a ""0""... you know the lowest setting on a buzzer. unbelievable"
"never tried this place but my experience was wonderful.  as a first timer i got the mvp at a discounted price!  wonderful.  i got an excellent haircut, beard trim and then in the ""showers"" a wash of my hair and massage.  i will return, this is my new spot...all for a reasonable price of$30 including tip!  i am a fan.  and all the time you can watch sports on tv...what's not to love.plenty of seating in the shop.  my only complaint is that check-in system is a bit confusing so have them help you the first time.  it is not user friendly, they need to change the screen to ""welcome sign in here."""
"my regular haircut spot since i moved to the area. i have been to several sports clips and this is my favorite location. the ladies are always friendly and professional and they do a good job keeping the line moving at a busy location. sunday is a madhouse so if you ain't there when the door opens just skip it. the business model they have is good, i like that they store how i get my hair cut, the wash and head massage is well worth $5, and they give a discount to police, fire, and service members. my only knock is the stupid overly complicated checkout system. it was slow before due to whatever brand card machine they use and now they added a computer pad interface to slow the process down. also you have to give your zip code to check in, why do you need personal info to check in? the new computers also fish for your email address which i absolutely hate."
"extremely disappointed with my experience here. brittany cut my hair and to say she was all over the place is an understatement. told her i didn't want much off the top, she started off fine then started blending. she used the clippers and went halfway up the top of my head on one side so i no longer have a part. she complained about how tired she was while singing to ""stay awake"" and just kept chopping. this haircut is one of the worse ones i've had and i am extremely disappointed with her service.  i wish i would not have spent the money on this haircut. i could have done a better job blindfolded."
"i have been coming here ever since they opened this location. i almost always get a good haircut. the girls always seem friendly. getting a haircut used to seem like a chore, now i feel like its a treat. the triple play is my go to service. the hot facial towel or even the cold towel during the summer is always so relaxing. i enjoy the green tea products they use as well. i even got my father hooked on coming here as well. keep up thr good work sports clips!"
"used to love going here. they never had crazy waits. i went twice in the past week during school hours and there was an hour+ wait. i called the 2nd time to see if my name could be signed in as i was on my way, and was rudely told ""we don't do that"". no sorry no attempts to provide any alternative. have to find a new haircut place now..."
"they do a good job with my son's haircuts, but can be a little more friendlier and price for a 12yo is a bit high. when i tipped her extra on the card she didnt even acknowledge the tip. a simple acknowledgement would suffice. i had to ask her if she saw it.  tipping is optional not expected!here's the bigger problem: please fix the sound system. the tvs are all on the same channel (which is fine) and it echos throughout the shop. add some surround sound and mute the tvs. headache city over here. rant over!"
"first of all, not all men like ""watching"" sports. it is a waste of time watching someone else enjoying themselves. so, when i visited the shop with a friend, i didn't care for the sports channels blasting the latest scores. that being said, the place is just a regular barbershop with the same bells and whistles as other shops. nothing special."
look for a girl named marisa! she cuts hair really well! i would definitely recommend going here! also i would go during the weekday around brunch. it's empty. plus the staff is really nice and very welcoming.
"the girls are great here. they offer good service and a very friendly attitude. my haircut is not always perfect, but everything else is always a good experience. i would recommend the mvp. once you get an mvp its hard to go back to normal haircuts. it is funny to say but i come here because i like everything else about the mvp, getting massaged, shampoos and the friendly atmosphere more than the haircut itself! lol."
"worst experience ever in a sports clips. came from atlanta first time in a sports clips here in nj and they didn't offer the mvp for being first time customer. cut my hair way to short, never coming here again. don't go here!"
sports clips is on my way home from work. i have not been too happy with my haircuts i've received my first two times there. yesterday i needed a haircut for a meeting the following day so i figured i'd give it one last shot.....a stylist named shelby cut my hair. best haircut i've had in a long time. shelby did an amazing job and couldn't have been more friendly. had a great experience and thanks to shelby i will continue to be a customer as long as she works there! thank you shelby!
"they don't take appointments, but that actually worked well for me and my husband.  we went in and only had one guy ahead of us while all three girls were working on other men.  we only had to wait about 10 minutes, but by that time, about 5 more guys came in and added their names to the list.  my husband had dana who did a great job on his hair!  he was probably with her for about 15 minutes and i really appreciated that dana asked me for my feedback since my husband's last haircut (not at sports clips) was horrendous.  we'll definitely be back!"
"went back again last night and again a great haircut.  michelle was great again, very friendly and nice.  pleasure to get my haircut there.definitely my new place.to get a haircut."
cool concept but agree that this is super cuts in disguise.  would have preferred a quality cut rather than the hot towel face wrap and shoulder massage.
"just got back from getting my ears lowered here. i'm very happy with the way my hair looks and i would definitely recommend going here. i 100% agree with vlad.the shop is sports themed (a dead give away by the name) and you're meant to feel like you're in a team's locker room. your first time you get the mvp treatment for the price of a regular haircut (cut, shampoo with head and back massage and hot towel). you'll also leave with a discount card so that on every other haircut, you save a bit of dough.also found out, neck and sideburn trims, in between haircuts, are complimentary.haircut pricing:$22 for the mvp treatment$20 for varsity treatment$17 for regular cut$14 for junior varsity (boy's cut)check it out."
"had a very bad haircut here. they butchered it! as for the supposed sports concept, i didn't feel it was distinguished from any other place."
"where else can you get a cut quickly, while watching sports?where else can you get a cut accompanied by a hot towel treatment while sitting in a massage chair, while getting a head massage?where else all of this costs around $20?definitely worth the while!"
"first time ever trying a sportsclips and i was blown away and kicking myself as to why i've never tried a sportsclips! great cut exactly what i had asked for, and then much to my surprise they don't just give you a rinse but rather you lean back in a massage chair while you get a full blown shampoo, head massage and a warm towel on your face. just when i thought i was done we went back to the chair, she took out a massage gun and i recieved a neck and back massage!  leave in conditioner was applied too. all the while having the option to watch sports the entire time. was truly pleased with their employee and concept. will definitely be returning. all of just described cost $24 but i was charged $19 for a first time customer."
"accompanied my boyfriend during his haircut and his stylist did an amazing job. i love his cut, suits him well, and he told me she was very personable too."
my two boys (jr. and high school) don't ever love getting their hair cut but they really like coming to sport clips. i do too and my wife always comments on how good a hair cut we all get. the stylist are all very nice and i've never had a wait issue - i've been at least 10 - 12 times now. i get the mvp which includes wash/shampoo/hot towel on face and shoulder massage. it's a good value - check them out!
"great place! they saw me five minutes before closing and made my day. morgan was friendly, efficient and provided an excellent cut. i was impressed with her skill.  will be back for sure!"
"all of the stylists are very nice and make sure the haircut is what you want. they don't take appointments, only walk-in. when we initially arrived there were only two or three people in chairs, so we were able to sit down for a cut immediately. it did fill up pretty quickly, but they have a tv screen that informs you of wait times and how many people are ahead of you. first-time customers get the mvp package (hot steamed towel, massaging shampoo, and neck massage) for free! cool and clean environment with plenty of up-front seating for waiting customers or friends!"
i booked an 11am appointment with a stylist. online booking confirmed her availability time. i sat and waited for 20min before leaving. she was only halfway done with her current haircut when i left. nothing worse than having your time wasted. don't go here. i love the keepitcut on 28th and indian school.
"my husband went here to get his haircut last week and it was terrible! i was eating lunch next door and when he met me after his haircut i seriously couldn't believe what a horrible job they did, it seriously looked like a little kid cut his hair, it was uneven all over and had long patches! i made him go back in there and have them fix it, they tried to fix it but still failed miserably. do not go here!!!"
we used the free haircut coupon we got in the mail for my 5 year old. i will be going back to v's barbershop this week to have it cleaned up from the haircut he got here.
my first time here was a great experience. the stylist did a great job! she knew just how to cut my hair for my head shape. i will never go to another budget hair cut place. sport clips is well worth the extra few bucks!
"sports clips a came ravingly recommended and i was pleased with the service i received from the moment i walked through the door.  it is noteworthy that they(owner) spent time discussing what i was trying to accomplish and made some excellent suggestions. the waiting lobby has the amenities, flat screens etc.    my stylist name was desiree, i highly recommend her.  she takes her craft very seriously and the discussion was informative and thorough as to how best to work with my hair and why, i always asks why.  she expertly answered every question.  i opted for the full treatment as this was my first time i wanted to see all the salon had to offer.  so i got a haircut, shampoo, foot massage.  i wish they knew how to give a hot towel razor shave, then they would be perfect. the strongest testament of the desiree skill as a stylist, was all the compliments i received at church the following sunday.  i highly recommend this desiree at sportclips."
i love this place. i only come to this location because of chelsea. she has been cutting my hair for years now and she's the best.
"great place! i've tried 5 different places to get my haircut this year. i've paid over 50 bux and under 20 bux trying to find the right place. this place is perfect - they're inexpensive, quick and provide a quality haircut (shampoo, steam towel, etc). also tons of tv's always showing sports. you can walk in any time!"
a friendly place with a pleasant staff.  i am always pleased with my haircut from misty!
"horrible haircut place, used to come here regularly until this mickey roarke looking tool by the name of chris ruined it for me when i showed him a reference picture to cut my hair and then despite this he still rudely refused to do it based off of the picture he asked how much i wanted off the sides and top. well that's why i brought a reference picture you idiot. he was clearly pissed off that i had come in 30 minutes before close, so by being rude and outright uncooperative he attempted to get back at me. i did like this place due to a few of the hair cutters but now i know that those people are few and far in between, most of them are just like this guy who don't give an f about you, just looking to make a quick buck. as i was writing this review the guy tried being nice to gain my respect back but sorry buddy being fake is just making it worse. never going here again, from. now on going to salons where the people can actually use a reference photo lol. this place is the mcdonald's of haircut places."
"i was in town for work and needed a haircut for a big meeting.  walked right in and was greeted by laura.  she ended up being the hair stylist that cut my hair as well. she is awesome , professional and very friendly. if i end up coming back into town i will definitely try to swing by. she was extremely polite and her customer service was unmatched.  my haircut was done so well.  she did it effortlessly which was very natural and impressive.5 star laura!-rick"
"always pleased with all the ladies at this location, but i can't help but single out laura.  not only does she make my hair look great,  she is so incredibly warm and friendly.  often when i come in there is a wait for her.  she is a very talented stylist,  and my hope is that the owner and management appreciate her incredible work ethic. again, the whole team is awesome, but i feel laura goes above and beyond."
"had an enjoyable experience here with the amazing nina. she perfected the haircut i was looking for (& i was trying something different), and was actually great company to have around. well worth the extra few dollars to go there!"
"i have passed other sports clips for about 7 years now to come to this location.   i used to exclusively have angela cut my hair, but have discovered other talented stylists there if angela is gone.   the hot towel and scalp massage is something i always look forward to.  everyone is always very friendly and i walk out with a good haircut.   every.  time."
awesome customer service. brought my 3 year old son in and got a great haircut from erika. was great at explaining what she was doing . will definitely be back!
awesome service. in and out. complimentary water bottles. watch sports. hot towels. hair wash. massage chairs. will be returning
at sport clip waited for 45 to 1 hr. the service was useless. they call it precision hair cut. for me it wasn't true at all. they miss so many places that i had to go home and ask my brother to cut the missing places that was sticking out. the hair stylist shampoo my hair when washing my hair the water seeped in my shirt and got my top shirt wet. i felt for the price i paid for the mvp package. i didn't get the mvp service. i hope someone in sports clips reads this and makes improvements.
"i haven't been to this sport clips location in a while, only because i am closer to the chandler location. i happened to be in the area grabbing a coffee and took my son to the new place across the street called keep it cut. i must have gotten a new or inexperienced stylist, because my son's cut was horrible - it looked like a toupee! i immediately took him to this sport clips to see if they could fix his hair. i was so relieved that the stylist he saw was able to save the day and make it look nice. she even gave me a discount because she felt bad for us - such great customer service. it's nice to see the quality of service remains unchanged. thank you sport clips!"
"went here today as hair was annoying me lol, and we have this chain in my home area, so walked in and had a girl take me in right away, gina if i remember her nae right was very friendly and good at what she did, and i got the mvp here and was very impressed with this cut, next time im in the phoenix area and need a haircut, i would probably go to this location."
great place to get a hair cut and bears trim! audrey did a perfect job with my weird styled hair do and was extremely friendly. this is officially the place that cuts my hair an beard from here on out.
"i feel like it's hit or miss with this place. sometimes i've gone and gotten a great haircut, other times it has been a disaster. i always get my hair cut the exact same way, so i don't understand why it's so difficult sometimes. the last time i went here, they did such an awful job (and it literally looks nothing like what i asked for) that i'm going to be finding somewhere else to go from now on. i can't style my hair at all because of how terribly it was cut, so now i just have to wait until it grows out so i can have it cut again somewhere else. if you're okay with taking the chance of having to wear a hat for the next 3 or so months, then this place is for you."
"i know what most people think about a place like this, it's a chain and you're never going to get a good, precise, haircut. that couldn't be farther from the truth, i always walk out with a great haircut. the waiting area is clean and the staff polite and really care about what you want. i come here about once a month and always leave satisfied."
"i have come in here more times than i can remember now. so they must be doing something right. i come in for a quick haircut at a low price. i always get a coupon, because, they send them out in the mail, which is good.the place is clean, and you do not need an appt.i always like the job they do. but, if you do not have a coupon or it is on special it could be a little higher than i like to pay."
"it pains me to write a negative review - i always get the most expensive haircut here, and then always leave a big tip, and i liked them - been coming here for years. then they switched from paper based reward system to computer (good), and they asked me for my cards to put on the computer last time i was in (good), but then none of my six ""stars"" made it to the online system.sp...i stopped in once, and they promised they'd check into it and call back. nothing. i called and left a message, and was promised they'd look into it and call back. nothing. i emailed them and waited for a reply. nothing. its just a shame - to treat, and lose, a customer over something so easily fixed as a free haircut (six ""rewards stars"")."
"the waiting room was freezing! that's my only real comment. i was waiting for my boyfriend while he got his haircut. he said he liked the hair stylist. she did a good job on his hair and told him about a product that could help soften his facial hair. he was interested. i know their customer is more a male demographic so it wasn't really a place i would go without my boyfriend or a male relative. i wasn't in love with their uniforms. it seemed like every girl was dressed different and they looked unorganized. it didn't seem great for branding and consistency, like normal chain establishments. i'm sure my boyfriend will return, i just happened to be with him and he was looking a bit too scruffy so i tagged along on his haircut."
"run away and don't buy the season pass.i had a solid 3 okay cuts so i bought the pass and just got the worse cut of my life. i am literally driving to a salon to get it fixed now.there is no training here. the people are nice but ""forgetting"" what they are doing half way through and messing up the cut with a razor is not excusable."
"just moved to tempe from gilbert and walked into this place a month or so ago because i needed a quick haircut.  there was a heavy wait but i was ok with it as i knew it was a last minute thing at 7pm.  i was finally called upon and laura introduced herself and she was great from the get go, not only was she the best at conversing, but the hair cut was darn good too.  i left extremely happy and i am glad i waited.  i found myself a month later (today) needing a haircut and decided to go back and low and behold the lovely girl who cut my hair last time was at the front to greet me.  i asked for her again and she got me in fairly quick, i was impressed she remembered just about everything we talked about the first time and the conversation was just as good if not better, laura makes the haircut enjoyable and i highly recommend her and this place, everyone there is super friendly."
"i used to come here often. today was my last time, however. after coming and bring told i would have a ""10-15 minute wait"" i sat waiting for an hour.  when i told them to take my name off of the wait list because i no longer had time, the response was just a shrug and ""ok"". they didn't even ask what my name was so they could take it off. ridiculous and unprofessional. looking for a new place now"
everyone is always friendly. ive been numerous times now and never gotten a bad haircut. very convenient to get food next door while you wait also
everyone is always friendly and professional. the haircuts have always been great. they have many stylists so the wait time is never too bad either. i haven't gone any where else since the first cut i got here. cheers!
"i took my husband to get his haircut here, and it was great! we walked in and got in right away. the lady did very well, and it was quick and easy. the prices are a little high for a simple cut in my opinion but it is cheaper then going to a high end salon."
"i went on their website on a sunday and did an online checkin, and there was a 0 minute wait. i got to the salon probably 2 minutes later and my name wasn't in the wait list and i had 2 people in front of me. i figured they just deleted me and added my name again and sat down fast forward 20 or 30 minutes and this kid comes in and says that he did an online check-in as well but his name wasn't on the list. they told him they'd push him to the front of the line which pissed me off because the same thing happened to me. when we expressed that all i got was an ""oh sorry about that""to top it off there were 3 people working and one took probably 30 minutes to do a child's haircut, and then another stylist had to come help fix it further delaying everyone else. eventually i had to go because i had a 1 pm meeting. i waited from 1205 to 1250 and got no where which is pretty ridiculous. this isnt the first time i have gone to this location and had issues so apparently it's pretty horribly managed. i never thought i'd have to boycott something as simple as a haircut place but i can't stand having my time wasted."
went in and was ignored. stood by register for 5 min with no one asking me if i needed anything.waited a while longer and finally gave up and went to great clips where they were happy to have my business.
the staff is extremely rude and unprofessional. i will never be going back. you can find much better service somewhere else. don't waste your time.
"levi loved his haircut and massage he got today.  the hairdresser had a fantastic attitude, so friendly and nice.   very outgoing.  solange was the gal that did his hair.  thanks for making my lil man so happy!!!"
"if it weren't for solange the new girl we would not be posting positive feedback but first of all, i want to give props to solange for her great personality and going above and beyond with her work. unfortunately, we can't say the same about her other two co-workers, one a so called manager name jessica and a allison; they were extremely disrespectful with us and with her new fellow co-worker when she simply asked a question. how unsupportive of their part and overall rude. i don't understand how someone can be given a title of a ""manager"" and they don't act like one.thanks again, solange for being so nice to us and we really appreciated your awesome personality! many blessings to you!all stars for solange and none for the others."
"used to come here all the time for what is a very basic haircut. after 3 months of growing my hair out i set out for a quick cut before work, and was told my wait would be no longer than 15 minutes, but i sat around waiting for about 25-30. i sat down and the manager asked if she could take a before and after picture of my haircut for their facebook page. now here is the crazy part, i was sat in a chair with a hair stylist i had never seen or met before and literally within 2 minutes i was being told by her that her female manager had been sexually harassing her over the past month by ""touching her a**"". the stylist informed me that even though she has asked the manager to stop, she still went out of her way to  touch her. then, with my jaw on the floor both because of the content of the story but also because of the fact i was a customer who only came in to get my damn hair cut and was being told a horrific story, the stylist began telling me how she was raped before working here and it efected her life greatly. this whole time the manager and other stylist were in the back and could not hear the conversation.  the stylist was rushing around with my hair, forgetting what she was doing while explaining to me in detail how and when her manager has touched her and was finished within 10 minutes with the cut. i got my hair washed then, as the stylist told me how she was hoping that someone would come and take care of the rapists in the world because it is simply not okay to make someone uncomfortable to come into work. at this point all i am thinking is, ""i hope to god that this haircut is at least decent after this terrible experience"". it wasn't. off to the styling chair for some gel and the stylist keeps noticing parts of my hair that she had missed and is cutting them while rubbing gel in, and the manager comes out again. she asks to take the after picture, during which the stylist is trying to covertly tell me not to take the picture and i shouldn't trust her. she took the picture and while doing so was finding pieces of my hair that will need to be cut and cutting them while i stand with a stupid grin on my face, visibly sweating because of the stress going on within my head. no other customers were in the store. i honest to god have never been so frighteningly uncomfortable in my life.two days later now and tried to call another store to get the information for the owner of the mesa riverview store, but of course no one can give me that contact information. tried both monday and tuesday to reach the corporate office by phone in texas, but was never put through to as much as a voicemail. i am astounded by the sheer level of incompetence displayed by the owners of the franchise, the corporation itself and the employees at this sports clips.my only suggestions can be to fire everyone in that place, get someone that is not a fucking customer for your employees to go to when they feel sexually assaulted, and to never ever go to this place. and on the last note, their facebook had no pictures of customers ever in their history expect for corporate stock gimmick photos so i am forced to speculate at what happened to the pictures of me that are floating out in someone's hands."
this was my go to place for haircuts they lost one of their best stylists and now the location runs slow and sluggish and no one seems to be in a hurry to help people with 4+ people waiting for a haircut
"the actual hair cut was great. the new check in system is flat out terrible. customers now check in on a computer, which is fine, and your name and wait time is then posted on a tv in the waiting area. my wait time was 11 minutes, and i ended waiting an extra 30 minutes past the initial 11 minutes for my haircut. the place was not busy at all, 2 people were finishing hair cuts as i walked in. the employees were having a great time making conversation, texting, and not working with any sense of urgency. if it was busy or there were a lot of people waiting i would understand, but it was not busy at all! very frustrating experience."
"i've been in search of a great barber shop for some time.  i've tried almost every shop with 4 stars or above, and still, never found a truly great haircut.  where my search logic was flawed was in that i was hyper-focused on price.yes, sport clips' full-service cut is more than i would normally want to spend.yes, it was worth it!a truly custom experience.  easily, the cleanest salon i've ever been a customer at. they ask the right questions, they listen to you, and they're not finished until you are satisfied.  stop looking, guys. this is your barber shop."
"i felt it was time to update my previous review... props are due for jessica too. just like tierra, she's confident and knows what she is doing. if one isn't there, i can just sit in the others chair. they both know what i like and are very professional. thanks tierra and jes!"
"been coming here 4 years and know 4 girls who work sara,davina,misty and jess. jess usually cuts my hair. all 4 girls are lovely there nice to the customers and there co workers a great crew at sport clips. but there's a new girl named solange she's very 2 faced i come to this location all the time she's nice at first but very rude after u know her. she's very rude to all of her co workers. i give the 4 girls all 5 stars but solange don't get 1 star in my personal opinion. if she worked for me would have got rid of her by now let's see how long till another review is up bought this new girl"
"yep, left there because apparently talking with people for more than 5 minutes after the haircut is done is more important than the one individual sitting in the place waiting to get their hair cut. went over to great clips and being called up for my clip now. learn something sports clips."
this place has a woman with black dreads working there who is completely intolerant of children. my littlest was checking out the merchandise to keep busy and wasn't doing any harm. no spillage or anything. our regular place where we go to get my husband's hair cut knows when my son messes up the shelf i put everything back nice and neat before we leave. it keeps him busy and prevents screaming and tantrums out of boredom waiting for his dad to finish with the stylist. we've even bought product from his little discoveries of shampoo and gel. went to this place for the first time because we were all tired and in a hurry to get my husband's hair cut. never again. got treated with hostility by a very annoyed black woman who acted in a huff as she rearranged the shelf. normally i'd put everything back for the salon but if she's going to act that way to paying customers and curious toddlers then by all means be rude to us and you can do the work yourself and we won't return. if she's the manager or owner it's no wonder the place was dead and lacked customers at one of the busiest times of the day for salons.
"i have been here a few times. the first time was a disaster as the girl rushed through as fast as she could and my hair was left lopsided. i called back later that day and asked to speak to a manager and they said that she was not available but that she could take a message and call me back. she never did. fortunately, i had a friend fix my hair but i was left with hair much to short for how i normally style it. after about a year i was in desperate need for a haircut for a funeral and couldn't get into my normal stylist in time so i sucked it up and went in again. i told the girl my concerns and explained very extensively how to cut my hair. this time this stylist did a wonderful job! she spent about 30-40 minutes cutting it and in the end it looked great! so, i recently had another situation where i needed a hair cut last minute and i went in for a trim. i was very disappointed again. the stylist this time was the same as before but she only spent about 5 minutes cutting my hair. she cut it all way to short and it was again lopsided. this was the worst cut i have ever had. i asked her to even it out especially on the sides were there was a noticeable difference. this proves to be a mistake and she ended up taking even more off of all of it and it was still lopsided. i voiced my disappointment and she seemed annoyed and eager to help the next person and practically booted me out of the chair. i called and talked to the ""manager on duty"" and she did apologize but said that they are pressured to do cuts as quickly as possible. (she also added that they are pressured to sell product.) i asked her how i am supposed to have my hair fixed and she offered to do it at no charge but that she couldn't do it the same day and that i would need to come back the next day. i had to go to work the next day so that was not an acceptable solution. fortunately for me, my sister-in-law was in town who does hair and she was able to fix it. she added that my hair was pretty bad and asked me if i tried to do it my self. no, i could probably do a better job. the service is to inconsistent and management doesn't seem to care about customer satisfaction. they are all about speed and they are overpriced. try somewhere else before you go here. not worth a months worth of bad hair."
"awesome place to get your hair cut.  close to tempe and mesa.   ask for audra, you won't be disappointed!"
we just had a great experience at the new sports clips. ashley handled my sweet and anxious 3 year old with tender care and gave him a pretty sharp cut. he is so excited. we will definitely be back.
i picked this place out for my bf to try because it was close by and had good reviews. he loved it!!! i am so happy we found somewhere he likes and that does a great haircut. we will definitely be regulars from now on.
"i am very impressed with this establishment. my last two haircuts were garbage so i thought i would give this place a try. i walked in, sat right down and was very happy with my haircut. i highly recommend sports clips to anyone in need of a good haircut. i got the ""mvp treatment"" and probably will every time i return. very happy."
had this lady named tesa. cut my hair in under ten minutes flat while pretended to be interested in my life. terrible hair cut. had to recut mine somewhere else. never going there again...
"i don't find sports all that particularly fascinating, even less so when i can't see without prescription glasses, but the haircut was great. i needed a haircut, why else would one stop in, and figured i'd give this location another try. on a previous visit, i didn't quite get the haircut i desired. upon examining my head closer at home - need to shower to wash off the always-there-after-haircut hair clippings - i noticed the unevenness on the sides and a general lopsidedness toward my right side. i proceeded to shave it all off and start fresh.i had found a decent barber outside of los angeles, ca, but didn't really want to drive 12 hours just for a haircut. as i am willing to try just about anything twice, i figured, as it had been quite some time since the last visit, that i could once again try sport clips. the establishment was on my way from the post office and it surely must have had new stylists working since the last debacle.upon entering, i was greeted and asked to check-in on their kiosk. the purported wait time was between 9-13 minutes, but as it's a haircut, it could easily take less or more - it didn't matter much either way, i had the time and needed the haircut. after about five minutes, if that, i was greeted by veronica and everything went smoothly from there.i really cannot say enough good things about veronica - she is quite attentive and seemed to actually care about how the hair was styled. she had questions and i deferred to her as she was the one that could see all around my head more easily. it's quite remarkable to find someone who concentrates on the task at hand, as opposed to many of whom have cut my hair and seem to be more interested in talking about personal lives that achieving a purpose. that's not to say she's impersonal, but i'm sure after describing my previous visit to sport clips, she was ensuring i would be more content this occasion or perhaps something else entirely. in either case, i no longer need to travel to california to have my hair cut... i just need to call ahead to ask if she is working or not.nothing but good things about veronica and this particular sport clips!"
"wow....how can it go from so consistent to so bad!just returned from a month long trip and needed this shaggy head trimmed. i get the same cut every time, however, like most of these places, i got a different stylist. everything was going fine and she was pleasant and nice. but when she turned me to face the mirror, damn! the front of my hair looked fine but the back part of my head looked like a little kid had gotten a hold of some scissors and simply cut a large swath of hair randomly off the top of my head! she basically made my hair look like i live in a wood shack in the appalachian mountains.but you can't fix it. i mean, i would have to buzz cut the whole thing! when i came home my wife said ""what the hell?"" and then my in laws snickered."
"this is a big chain like supercuts.i have had about 6 or 7 haircuts here.today my stylist arrived quick, before i finished signing in.what i wanted was a precision cut, quick!what i got was a precision cut, quick.my stylist was awesome, and well awarded. 10 years with sport clips. and hit a home run with my cut!!!!. not too pushy with the product upsell and super kind with a great cut. i'm back, see you in 3 weeks."
"i have gone to this sports clips on many occasions. i have always found the stylists to be friendly and polite. that is until last tuesday. i am a 67 year old male, and i went in to have my neck trimmed, as they offer a free neck trim if you need one in between haircuts. it had been three weeks to the day since my last haircut, but my sides were looking shaby after two weeks so i decided to go in. i encountered kelly, the manager. right away she stared going on how they couldn't do my sides and back and could only trim the neck. she was rude and with a snarky attitude said its been nearly a month since my haircut. i told her its been three weeks and if i needed a full blown haircut after three weeks it wasn't cut short enough in the first place. in any case she got side tracked with someone else and i decided i would rather walk out and not have to deal with her again. what a poor example of a manager. the owners should take notice. with so many options for an inexpensive haircut i will go elsewhere. frank in scottsdale"
olivia was absolutely fantastic. i have had my hair cut by her and other great stylists there. this one was one of my favs for sure tho! one of my favorites ever!!! she did so good and her head massage was like suppper long. i can tell she is always eager to please!!! give her a raise and give her a high five! sorry that i was going to other hair stylists and cheating on her! i will be back lol! my hair looks perfect and dang that massage was a 10! :)also... a long time ago i left a scathing review here but things are way different now. i appreciate either good service and will review accordingly or i will totally let everyone know how much you suck. i just appreciate nice people who care. this place rocks now! also i think the name was stevie. she did great and all my haircuts for the last year or so have been great! everyone here is a+ :)
"never been to sport clips, but have been wanting to go. went in, met lori, who was very nice and did a great job on my hair. i just moved here so to go to the same person for 6 years and get use to sitting down and having my stylist know what to do, didn't know how much i would have to say but she was on point and did a fantastic job! the mvp is worth it. i found my new regular place to go!"
"i've had two haircuts at this place, and neither one was bad, but if i'm going to a cheap place i'll just stick w/great clips since they're...well, cheaper (and quite honestly i think they do a better job...the one by my house does, anyway).quite frankly, i think the whole sports theme is a little gimmicky. when i go in to get a haircut i just want to get in & out (i have short hair so it doesn't take long to cut), so i can care less about a ""theme,"" tv's, etc... this place tries and promote it's ""extras"" in addition to just a haircut (wash/shampoo, a neck massage, and i think one or two other things). they call it the ""mvp."" eh. i mean, if you're into that and want to pay the five extra bucks, that's fine, but like i said, i just want my haircut and to be done. the two times i've had my haircut here, neither girl did a bad job, but they were no better than any other chain haircut place."
"i live in wyoming, michigan and go to sports clips i really like the atmosphere the people are so friendly and know how to cut hair i am 60 years old and have been to many hair shops in michigan i tried sports clips and believe me when i say they are the best place to go for the experience i will say it is one of a kind if you haven't tried them please you owe it to yourself to a treat they treat you like family"
"i was over due for a haircut so i stopped in at sport clips. it was a great experience; i had the mvp experience which included a haircut, neck and shoulder massage, shampoo and a hot towel. i look forward to returning for my next trim.rick the happy camper"
"olivia is the best always does a fantastic job, highly recommended!"
"if you're a guy, love sports and like to be pampered while getting a superb hair cut, then this is the place for you. the first thing i noticed was how intently i was listened to as far as what i wanted in a haircut. then there is the sports. they had the baseball channel on, which was fine, as i love baseball, but if you ask them to change the station so you can watch football or anything else, they are happy to oblige.hot towels for your face and even a neck and shoulder massage await you there, all free if you're a first timer.it only $4 more than great clips, but you get a lot more for your money."
"update!the manager of the location, sarah, called and was extremely apologetic and very gracious.  she was upset that i was made to pay for this haircut.  my intention was not get anyone fired and that is not what happened... the person quit without notice and is no longer a stylist there.  she was there for only 3 days and i just wanted to update my review as she is not a reflection of my experience there and i have been going there for a couple of years.  if that stylist had continued to work there, i would not have gone back as the review below does not actually reflect just how bad that person treated me.  also, i wanted to clarify that it was not because of a bad yelp review that they acted.  i used the contact form on the company website and sarah reached out to me based on that.  a company cannot control all of their employees all the time... humans will be humans and i feel sarah handled the situation very professionally and to my satisfaction.  i will be giving them another chance to keep my business and, based on my experiences prior to this one stylist, i imagine i will be happy with the haircut and the extra treatment sports clips offers.worst haircut of my adult life! i used to get my haircut here fairly regular probably won't ever be back. they had me in the system for an inch and a half on the sides 2 inches on the top. she took the razor and went down the side and i felt like i had just entered the military. when i said something about it she said that is one and a half inches that is the attachment i used. later she said it was a mistake on the notes and they had it down as a number one attachment. funny thing is that never happened before. i doubt it is even a quarter inch as i can barely even pinch the hair on the side of my head. the challenge is my hair goes spiky when it is too short and so i will have to deal with that for the next few weeks as it grows back. wouldn't be as big a deal but i have a youtube series i am supposed to be recording over the next two weeks. and this is not a confidence booster."
"a haircut is a necessity but the stylists at this place make it a pleasure, with a massage and hot towels. they listen carefully and keep notes on what you like from visit to visit. i recommend them."
"i came here a year ago and had a fantastic experience. since then i always come to see amber, she has a great haircuting ability. you won't be disappointed."
amazing experience every time i am in there! i have been going back for almost 6 months now. i have been to other sports clips but have found this one to be the one i like the most. i drive from mesa to this location just to get my hair cut by amber. she does a great job!
"very cute and good performing employees, however they're extremely understaffed. usually never more than 2 employees working which is truly ridiculous. especially for being in a shopping center"
always have a good experience when i come here. staff is friendly and they let you know how long it will be if there is a wait. i'm usually in and out in less than 30 min.
i'm not a fan of the theme.  they could do much better on the theme.they could make it far more sporty and it would be cool.  they don't stick with the theme well.staff is ok.  nothing great or horrid.
"the boys love coming here.  conveniently located right down the street from our house and usually get in very quick.  stadium style seating, sports themed, locker room setting and a tv for us bystanders to watch football, baseball or basketball depending on time of year and time of day.  complimentary water bottles for those waiting also.   an assortment of magazines if you are the reading type.  very friendly staff and the boys always act a little cockier once they get their new hair-do.  i shave my head at the house or i'd come here as well.  kids and seniors are $15.00.  adults $18.00 and the mj- $23.00 for a cut, steamed towel, shampoo and neck and shoulder massage."
my son's hair cut today was one out of a book of horrors. we asked for a simple  undercut. what we got was a lopsided fade with uneven sideburns and a crooked back line.  the free bald spot he got will grow out in time however the verbal shellacking i received from my wife because i let my son get mangled by these horrible people will not.no thanks.
the absolute worse customer service i've ever experienced at a barber shop. i was in the area and stopped in for a cut. assent greeted or acknowledged by either of the two girls on staff. as one finished her cut she cleaned up her station and didn't even look my direction. as the second finished her hour of chatting as two of us sat patiently for a cut she grabbed him still not asking if i needed anything. still the second sat around doing nothing. i would never come here again and highly recommend anyone wanting a haircut to do the same. if you want to chat meaninglessly this is your spot!
"i love sports clips, especially the mvp package, you get a haircut, shampoo, steam towel,face massage and then even a shoulder massage all for a little over $20 :-)allyssa cut my hair this time and she did a great job, i have a lot of thick hair (thanks mom) so it takes a while and she took her time. the wait was only about 10 minutes but most of the time there is no wait at this location."
terrible service and even worse haircuts. dont waste your time here. go to a barbershop where they can actually do a half way decent job of cutting hair.
"haven't had such a bad haircut  since my mother did my brothers and my hair as kids. the wait was over half an hour with two people ahead of me but only two barbers working. i have a relatively simple hairstyle, nothing fancy at all. the lady doing my cut was getting sick or just getting over a cold, i don't know but she kept coughing and had to leave for a while to get her composure and cough drops. (why come to work with the public if you're sick?) she butchered a simple fade, left me with a near bald spot on the side of my head and had to be asked to cut the long hairs she left over my ears.  very displeased!"
"yvonne does my fiancé and my 2 year old sons hair. every time she does such a great job!! my little boy does great with her, he likes her haha"
"i got the coupons in the mail, so i decided to give it a try. the atmosphere was welcoming and evonne was very nice. the wait was a little long, but expected because it was a friday night. my boy was usually nervous because he didn't like the sound of the clipper, but evonne did such a great job at talking to him and distracting him. i will defintely go back to this sport clips and ask for evonne next time."
i just had a haircut here at sports clips on dobson and baseline and it was the best haircut experience i have ever had. i have an anniversary date tonight so i wanted to make sure my hair looks really good. melinda is excellent and a perfectionist so my hair looks fantastic. i've been to sports clips several times before and the haircuts are always pretty good but melinda has exceeded my expectations and really went above and beyond to make sure my hair looks perfect. i really appreciate it and i hope melinda gets the credit she deserves. if you come here to sports clips try to get an appointment with melinda. awesome job.
"this is a nice location. usually pretty slow, but at times can get busy. expect a 20 minute or so wait just due to the amount of ladies working here. i usually come on sundays so i am ready for my week. it is really clean as well at this location. if you haven't been here before you get a free upgrade to mvp. i will be back to this one as long as i am in the area."
"loved the cut, great customer experience, talented and pleasant employees. i will definitely be back, thanks to the friendly and professional service from danielle!"
never knew such a great place existed! trust me guys go here to get your hair cut. cheaper than a salon. way better than a barber.
i stopped here by chance and i ended up having a really great experience.  my hair stylist took her time to make sure my haircut came out looking sharp. i thought this was a great deal for the price and i will be coming back in the future.
"marissa has been cutting my hair the last 3 times, i'm hoping she stays around as i have never been happier. mvp is the only way to go."
i take my son here and he always gets the cut that he wants!! the staff here really keep a good conversation with him. the place is always clean and has a great vibe.
i went for a hair cut...  i noticed all of her clippers all had hair on them. at the end i asked the stylist to be sure and get the hair in my neck. never happened and i did not notice due to her talking too much. i asked  her to style my hair and she handed me a brush...? the brush was covered with hair. filthy and nasty... avoid.
"very convenient location with lots of parking.  staff is very friendly and all do an excellent  job of styling hair per your request. equipment appears clean snd well maintained. the ""mvp"" includes a hot towel, wash, and back message.  each chair has a tv with espn.  prices are great. only downside if they follow the corporate policy of no appointments which is a real  bummer."
this is a great place for a haircut! my boys love going to see amanda there. she always does a great job on current trendy styles and they won't let anyone else touch their hair! the facility and equipment is always clean. highly recommended.
great place to get a haircut! stylists are great! great atmosphere. mvp is the way to go.
great place! the stylists are friendly and do a great job. the place was busy but properly staffed so the wait was less then 10 minutes with no appointment needed. mvp treatment is a great treatment that left me refreshed and invigorated. i'll definitely be returning. kid-friendly and plenty of tvs to watch
a friend introduced me to sportclips and i couldn't be happier. this is like the spa for guys plenty of sports on tvs inside and you have to love the treatment you get with the mvp package.
"great first experience trying sports clips out after patronizing a nearby competitor for 12 years that's gone downhill. amanda was great, very friendly and courteous. the equipment and working area was very clean and since it was my first visit i got the shampoo, hot steam and shoulder massage $5 off but for $22 it's a great deal and i'll definitely be back."
"in moving to phoenix one of the immediate challenges was in locating a good barber.in lieu of having the time to look and trial and error i ended up at sport clips.the stylists are friendly but also wildly inconsistent so once you find one that gives you the cut you want, you will need to request her by name from then forward.the full treatment to always cool as the hot towel and wash are relaxing.the massage thingy is a bit of a time waster.sport clips is worth the 3 stars"
"i've been going to sport clips for several years.  i used to go to great clips.  there is a big difference.  not that there is anything wrong with great clips, but sport clips really raises the bar for adding to the hair cut experience.  every time i have received a hair cut i have upgraded to at least a triple play.  the shampoo (mini head massage) with tea tree shampoo and a steam towel on the face after the cut is what keeps me coming back.  the staff at the ahwatukee location are attentive and friendly.  they often get busy but the have sufficient staff to handle the wait time.  i'll be back fo' sho'!  :)"
"i was visiting from out of town and realized i was looking like teen wolf so i needed a taper, bad!! it was 4:45pm on a sunday and they close at 5pm. i walk in expecting them to be like ""great its that guy who comes in when were about to close..."" not at all! i was greeted promptly and got matched up with racheal. she sure knows her way around some scissors! she cut me up good!! not only was the cut top notch, she gave me a minty flavored towel to wrap around my face while she used another minty flavored shampoo product to massage my head!! did i mention the chair was a massage chair? yeah. this place is legit!!!! highly recommend"
"i had an issue with a previous haircut at this location and was contacted directly by the manager, leanne.she was more then willing to see me right away to fix my haircut.   i went in on 5/26 and met with leanne in person.   she took me asap and addressed the issue i had with my haircut from the day before and assured me it would not happen again.  i was more than pleased and will definitely be coming back to this location in the near future.   i will highly recommend having leanne service you as she is upbeat, very personable, profesional.   she definitely gave me the sport clips experience i have always expected and experience at many other locations."
"stopped in for a quick haircut for my son today.  been to this sports clips numerous times.  all stylists were very nice, attentive and shop was nice/clean.  after i explained what i wanted typical short blended, pretty traditional kid haircut.  the stylist took him back and cut his hair.  after 5-8 minutes she asked me to come back and take a look and unfortunately i really wasn't paying attention i just glanced and said ok.got home and seen his hair outside in the sun and was unpleasantly surprised.looks like she went too high on neck line and it was crooked... and looks like there was an oops little patch, as well as the blend/fade was spotty.  minor bits of longer hair was still on neck and around ears.  i did call and they were very nice and offered for me to come back and fix it but we were already home.  i am posting hopefully so they will not let someone else walk out of the shop like that."
fast service. nice warm face wrap vibration chair and hair wash. nice message afterward. friendly ladies and great haircut also.go for the mvp. it's great.
friendly and personable stylists... everything else is simply atmosphere (which itself has improved tremendously over the years). evan at this location is the best!
just change over to this place after a few botched haircuts from the other clips. my 3 boys and i really appreciate shara and the work she did. we are all pretty picky and she cut out hair exactly how we wanted. thanks shara!
"leanne, evan, erika and the team are always friendly, give great cuts and the shop is friendly and easy."
i was fortunate to have evan cut my hair.  it was a fantastic experience.  she did a wonderful job and took the time to listen to me about my hair and how i like it to look.  evan is a wonderful ambassador of the organization.
the mvp is awesome and jackie is a great stylist and funny. not rushed in n out like some other places.
"great place for a haircut.  fun environment with ladies that know how to give a quality hair cut.   i prefer kim, however they are all very good.   rarely is there a long wait.   highly recommend this location."
"i love getting my haircut here. as a guy, i don't have (or need) a ""regular"" stylist. sports clips is great because they take all of the awkward conversation out of it. no need to feel guilty making small talk, because you can watch the game while your hair is being cut. that being said, the staff is always warm and friendly, and i haven't gotten a bad cut yet. i give four stars instead of five because the wait time is a bit long at times."
"kim is my new favorite cutter.  i'm a seasoned veteran of sport clips, but had never been to this location.  she greeted me warmly, signed me in, sat me down, and got started.  this is the point at which she distinguished herself -- she started by asking me questions and actually listening to what i had to say.  kim figured out my hair and the radical (for me) changes i wanted to make.  halfway trough the cut, she stopped and carefully reviewed the progress with me before finishing the job.after the ordeal (haha!), i bounced out of the shop with my most satisfactory haircut in years.  i'll go back to this sport clips again and when i do, i'll have kim pull another rabbit out of her hat.  if you're looking for a haircut, give this place a shot."
"if you're man/woman and you're looking to get a great haircut, this is the place to be. i highly recommend visiting shelby o the manager, to get top of the line customer service and a saloon quality cut. she is excellent at what she does and on top of that has an amazing personality that makes getting a haircut something you look forward to, not something you look at as a chore. next step is to book an appointment and see the quality you'll be receiving for an affordable price."
"i've been a regular at sport clips since my first review (nov 17, 2016) of the arizona pavilions location in marana.since then i moved to chandler and have been a customer at this location for a few months now.the price for a haircut at this location is a little higher than i was paying in marana. however, i still believe it is a good value due to the quality of the service.i also appreciate the fact that they usually have more staff on duty than the marana location and so the wait time is shorter, especially on busy saturday mornings."
"been coming to this location for a while now and i love it. all of the stylists do a great job and the staff turn over here isn't like other barbershops as it's low. with a yelp check in you get $5 off the very relaxing mvp which includes a cut, shampoo, warm steamed towel and massage. also, if you bring your receipt with you before 30 days, you get $3 off. espn is on all day and they provide free bottled water."
"up and down experience here. haircuts have been great, but wait times are too long. frustrating to come in to a 30 minute wait and then get bumped another 15 minutes because of an obvious regular, who frankly didn't need a haircut, for reasons i'll let you figure out.as someone who's been in customer service for 20+ years this kind of thing drives me up the wall."
dude sarah is the bomb dot com. i do a lot of moving around and i always have trouble finding a stylist i actually feel comfortable with. i showed her one picture and she got the job done perfectly.
good mens cut. unfortunately had to wait over an hour.
"the girls at this location are flawless! i come to this location because it just happens to be the closest, but i have been to probably 9 different sportclips. this one stands out the most, mostly for customer service. i one random day i decided to try this location after the new move, and i was hooked since. the manager is great, as well as everyone employed there. i am moving again soon, but am debating driving the extra mile to keep this place my main!these girls deal with people all the time that come in 5 minutes to close (i'm not one of them!), and they keep their composure with a smile on their face. that's just one example that separates them from other locations. chelsea that just moved from this location will be missed, as she was the best head massager ever.dana is definitely at the top of the list when it comes to a quality haircut. she listens, and cuts accurately! she can also put up with a rediculous non stop conversation from me. ask for her!"
"went in this morning, waited forever as the stylists chatted at length without barely cutting their clients hair.  the loud tvs made the wait unbearable."
"dana did a great job.good cut, good massage.had a migraine going in... no headache after leaving."
i live in tempe. i know there are several sport clips locations that are closer but this one is by far my favorite! it is worth the extra miles for a good quality haircut. jenn is by far my favorite stylist! :) she goes above and beyond in her mvp massages
was feeling brave one day and decided to change my old hairdo in for a new trendy one... the gal that cut my hair made sure to walk me through all of the decisions to make it my new haircut. thanks guys for what you do!
"do not recommend.  the lady who cut my hair had 11 years experience and still got it wrong. i asked for a taper and she gave me a fade. in addition i had to go back because how jagged the lines were. she was happy to fix it but made excuses why it looked that way, blaming my hair.  i'm white if that tells you anything about my hair.  i saw another guys haircut and it was crooked as well. ended up shaving it off."
"a year and a half later, and jessica is still the haircut girl of my dreams. there have been a couple of occasions where i've had to get cut by other girls at sport clips, and even cuts at places other than sportclips. the sportclips cuts were always good, far above the other places i went to . be sure to tell jessica hi for me if you go in!"
"ever since moving to az 4 years ago i have been coming to sportclips on ray and the 101. i have had several of the stylists cut my hair and they all do a fabulous job. i do admit that i have a very simple haircut and it comes out perfect every time. i prefer to have my haircut done by chelsea. why i prefer chelsea is when she washes my hair, to me, it is not just a wash but more like a massage on my head. she will get parts of my head and neck that gives me full body goosebumps. i have never had anything like this in the past.  chelsea is always happy to see me. i am a very loyal customer to awesome service and this place delivers."
the reviews didn't lie! had an awesome experience. received the mvp package for the introductory price since that was my first time there. chelsea did a great job!
"today on my way to groceries i stopped in to get my step son a hair cut. we had a short ten minute wait and then he was called back by jackie. she told us his cut was being upgraded to the ""mvp"" since we were first time customers. he got a shampoo, scalp massage and hot towels after his cut.jackie did a fantastic job! she listened and cut his hair exactly the way i wanted it. after trying so many places and being disappointed, i was thrilled with his cut and for only $13. his hair has never looked better. i hope jackie sticks around, we will definitely be back."
"having never been here before, we had no idea what to expect. my boyfriend has always loved having long hair and decided it was time to chop it off for a more professional look. he was super nervous! i brought a couple of pictures of ideas that he liked (knowing it wouldn't come out exactly like them but something along the lines of them). krista explained what was possible and what wasn't. she gave us her input and we talked and laughed the whole time. she did such an amazing job! i couldn't believe my boyfriend left so happy! krista is such a sweet girl who was so very accommodating, friendly and amazing at her job. no doubt he'll be back to see her!"
"first haircut in arizona after moving from ca.  kathryn went above and beyond to make me feel welcome, she took her time to understand what i want and spent about 40 minutes on my mvp - priceless...!!!  will defiantly be back."
horrible haircut. she didn't even listen to what i wanted. if you want to feel like a sheep and have electric shears run over your head for 5 minutes and then charged 18 bucks this is the place to go. i won't ever be going back!!!
"so i tried this place out after vowing not to return to great clips. the haircut was as expected with a short wait time, and what is cool is they will do a trim around your neck line and ears in between haircuts. i took them up on it prior to my trip to mobile. overall an ok experience. i don't expect a lot from getting my haircut, they met the need."
"this place has great ambiance! we were greeted with a ""welcome to sports clips"" in unison, and then  once we walked to the front to check in, one of their hairstylists said ""good morning"" and then asked if we had been there before. i'm pretty big on the small things that employees are not required to do- such as the "" good morning."" once we filled out  our name and phone number, we sat on folding chairs that had a cushion. the seats faced the front  where the stylists were. there was two screen tvs showing games. it's a sports lovers place for sure! the stylists have lockers to hold towels, and their supplies so it is not cluttered like other places. the prices are painted on the wall. when your sitting, it's a little hard to see, i had to stand up. they use the online check in system and i love that for time manage purposes. when we checked in it said wait time was 3 min. and it was exact! how often does that happen, right?  anyhow, linda cut my sons hair, and fixed what another company could not do. i asked for a one on the sides l, and short scissor cut on top with a little to comb and flip in the front.  what i thought should have been a quick 2 min fix, resulted in a full 13 min haircut. linda was thorough with the haircut, took her time, and once complete examined it and then said ""i'd like to tighten around the top if it's okay with you"" i appreciated this very much. again, how often does this happen?  as we exited, they have a box of combs at front that says ""take one free"" - huge perk! thanks! i will be back and hope to find the same service again!!"
there is always a long wait and never enough people cutting hair. i love sport clips but this location is never prepared enough. if you want an hour wait on a tuesday afternoon then this is the spot for you. don't even think about getting in and out on a weekend day in under an hour and a half.
"i've been getting my haircut here once a week for the last six months. i'm a huge fan of the sports clips brand. pro's: my stylist is the best. great fade, clean edge up.. really just the best. love the free neck trims!con's: the wait time is hit or miss. this place is always packed, but i don't mind waiting.. knowing that i'll get a great cut. not all of the stylists are friendly (or even attempt to be), but hey.. i'm good with mine lol."
place seems to always be packed which is always a good thing.jose always gives me a great haircut and the staff is always very polite and courteous
"good haircuts,  get the mvp deal, its worth it."
"it took me a while to find someone i was comfortable with, but when i finally stepped in, wow was i happy.my stylist knows my name and doesn't need to be told what i like. i know they make notes in their computer, but not having to explain my preferences over and over and over is refreshing. my son & i both have our hair done here and, i must admit, i'm a sucker for the massaging shampoo. the fact that i get to watch sports, then sit and chat for half an hour is cool with me. kudos to the nice staff and clean establishment. 5 stars!"
didn't honor my sports clip coupon i got off at high school coupon book in the area. i actually was already in my seat and got up and left. i feel like if the company is going to release coupon they should be city wide.
"its all about the individual stylist you get. i have gotten a decent haircut at this location, but this last one was pretty bad.  looked like i did it myself with a pocketknife. i know that if i go back they will cheerfully fix the uneven spots, but that would make it far shorter than what i wanted."
"friendly staff and a great haircut.  got the works, the massage chair was a little over the top but the shampoo with massage was very nice.  stylist took her time and we talked while cutting my hair.  just like all saloons, they try to upsale you  to their shampoo, styling products but not too much pressure.  thanks for supporting vets - got a free haircut and they treated me like a vip."
"ok, i'll admit that i'm a total sucker for having my head washed. the vip package is a great way to treat myself.  i just have to remember to avoid them on the weekends. seems like everyone gets their haircut on the weekend.  my only other complaint, seems like there is a lot of turn over. i've been going to this location for over 2 years and only had the same stylist do my hair once, all the other times, it was someone new to me."
"being in the military there are many things that you have to do upon moving to a completely new area, one of which being: ""where the heck am i going to get my hair cut?""sport clips has been my go-to place for about 2 years now, and upon moving to the san antonio area and needing my first haircut here, i naturally went to the closest sport clips and i was not disappointed!first time customers get the mvp treatment (hot towel, shampoo, massage) for only the price of a haircut, which for me with a military discount comes out to about $14.my hair looks great, the stylists are always nice, and this will be my new go-to location.my only suggestion is to make an appointment, because walk-ins on busy days will wait around 30 mins like i did. not a deal breaker, but will definitely try to work around the busy hours."
i am giving them 5 stars! however it is only 5 stars if you get dulce. its about a 3 star service if you get anybody else. dulce doesn't rush you and she ensures that your haircut is perfect and that you get your money's worth when you get a mvp. if you get anybody else you will feel rushed and feel like you paid to much.
"do you remember the flowbee? what a stupid idea. how about it's lesser known idiot cousin the robocut? that action had a picture of a human girl getting her hair cut on one side, and a long haired canine on the other. no, seriously.the moral of the story here is i never used any of those to cut my own hair, but i did in fact cut my own hair. once i got tired of doing it my self i set out to find a place that cost more then $5 for a mens hair cut, but less then $100. sport clips is where i ended up. they do try to fill a niche, however it's not one i'm completely that excited about. if you like watching sports instead of socializing with your barber(ess?) then this is the place for you.the one thing that i appreciate the most about the sport clips franchise is it's consistency. the fact that they specialize in mens haircuts also helps. i've gone to multiple locations both in and out of city and walked out with the same cut. of course i don't have anything ""flock of seagulls"" complicated, but still, the point is if i did i'd be able to get it at any sc location.seriously, the robocut. i mean. why? why?"
"absolutely the best place to get a haircut! no ifs, ands, or buts about it! the friendly staff, quick service, and fantastic atmosphere are all just a tip of the iceberg compared to the fantastic haircut that i received from laura! the absolute best haircut i have received since retiring from the navy. i like having hair after over 20 years of not having any and now i love my hair do! i can't give laura enough praises for her caring and professional work. i won't go anywhere else or let anyone else cut my hair!"
by far the best barbers i've gone to in  san antonio. couldn't find a barbershop that i liked since i moved here two years ago.    wait time is little to none. especially if you check-in online. upon entering through the doors there's always a warm-welcome and a followed through hand shake. they have in their system comments on what kind of haircut of always get. they listen to you and ask allot of questions before they start cutting your hair.    you can just tell and sense that they're eager to give you the best haircut possible. amazing staff!they're my official barbers now. keep up the good work!
"i popped in for a last minute haircut and one particular professional stuck out to me based on presentation alone. susy gave me the exact haircut i wanted and she had in-depth knowledge of the style that works well with my face, my hair type and product to go with it as well. i'll be the first to admit that i'm totally stand-offish when it comes to buying new products but susy discusses the what, how, and why behind it all and i'm sold. the best haircut i've had in a few years. i will be back!"
so pissed right now. i just got the shittiest fade ever.  how can something so basic get screwed up?! i would've paid her not to cut my hair. now i gotta go to work looking like shjt.never again.
for a sport clips i didn't expect much and i wouldn't be upset if it wasn't perfect but i had the lady by the name of bee cut my hair and i was really good actually. i just told her what i thought i wanted and make it look good and was honestly one of the best haircuts i've gotten. never left a review on yelp but definitely worth it.
"honestly best place to make conversation and get a great haircut!!  not to mention a hot towel and massage, 10/10 in my book!!  #winningif you go, ask for shanna!!  she's a superb stylist and is someone who keeps me going there"
"i used the online check-in and selected megan. i was greeted upon arriving and only had to wait a few minutes.  i'm not super picky or anything but the last time megan styled my hair i had a good experience and she recommended some products to help manage my gray. i had some gold tones that were bothering me and the shampoo she used and recommended for me to try at home is working.  megan is another go to stylist for me at sportclips,  andre and megan would be my two draft picks if there was a draft for stylist."
"thank god for sport clips, after a haircut that looked like something out of botched, the tv series, that i received from locker room hair cuts, charlene took time out of her day to give her best attempt at cleaning it up and making it look much much better. i'm so grateful for sport clips and their trained team of hair professionals. sport clips 10/10locker room haircuts -10/10 (that's even giving too much credit)."
awesome barber!  easy process to walk in and megan w. was great!!  also nice that they provide an option to donate to vets.  definitely recommend if you're in the area.
"i am new to the area, from louisiana and i had an old czechoslovakian barber there that used to cut my hair. an old man that went to world war 2, cursed, spat tobacco in a spitoon, and cut my hair with a pair of stainless steel scissors that sat in a jar of blue water. i'd get a shave too with a straight razor. well those days are over. i moved here and none of the barber's here are any good. they suck, they try too hard and they're not very likable. plus the last guy i went to jacked up my hair and did a horrible job on it. i found this place and it is what it is. you walk in and if you can wait, you wait. if you have a stylist you like you wait for her, if she's there, or you take whoever is available. i don't care so much about who does it, as my hair is easy to do and i wear a hat so when it gets long enough i go down here to have it trimmed down. those guy's complaining about their 'hair' not right or whining about something off, get over yourself. probably these same guys wearing tight shirts showing man nipple with slim jeans that will get them an ass kicking or man rape in certain parts of town. please. i go in here for an old school john unitas flattop buzzcut.it isn't what i'm used to but i hate everyone in the area here. the girls here are nice and haven't annoyed me yet so i will keep coming here."
"i've always had a great experience at this location. shanna is a great stylist! she's attentive to detail and has given me great advice on different hairstyles. she's very polite and professional, as is all the staff. i would definitely recommend this location."
worst hair cut ever!!!!! i will never ever bring my son to get a hair cut at this place ever again. they latterly chopped of pieces of his hair. we asked for a specific hair cut and were given a chop off. the stylist seems to cut her own hair as well since hers was chopped the same way. we were disappointed my son left that place crying because he had waited to let his hair grow for 2 mo. to have the hair cut we asked and showed a pic of. now we had to wait again to let it grow and took him to a more experience stylist to fix her mess up.
great service.  sharlene is the best!!!
nothing to write home about - nothing particularly special about this business.  i expected more because the location is an upscale new shopping center in san antonio.
do not go to this sport clips hey will mess up your hair. drive to other locations instead.
if you love your sports and a great haircut. this is the place. upbeat! always have product stocked. all the staff is friendly. they know the latest styles. always recommend the best product for your hair type.
great haircut from niki and she knew her products very well! even though i don't live in san antonio she made me feel like i was a regular i will definitely be coming back! great value!
never again! for the fifth time over looked and ignored. other patrons welcomed and helped while i waited.  had customer mention to stylist i was there before him and it did not matter.  can i give no stars?
"i'm really impressed my this franchises' consistency.  great location, given the enormous selection of shops and how close it is to a tourist spot like fiesta texas.  staff was quick and i got a great cut."
"traveling around san antonio with business the past 3 years , this is my place for a hair cut  . friendly atmosphere and enjoying going here . danny and kevisa is great . i highly recommend going here . they'll cut your hair the way you want it ."
everyone is always so friendly and professional. always have danny cut my hair.does an excellent job.always fun to talk to. has a one happy customer.
"i've been to sports clips in cali and va. this is the best know i've been to. i was really hesitant to come here because my previous experiences have been not good. but in sa this was the only open haircut place i could find open on a sunday. alex did a great job with my hair did everything i requested. actually she is the only barber i've been to that actually combed my hair the same way i do. usually the barber will put gel in my hair and comb it all crazy!! not alex, she did a great job cutting, shampooing, and re-styling it! she used a gel that worked really good. i may have to switch to a new gel! got the mvp service. cut, hot towel, shampoo, massage, and gel. i'll come back before i leave sa."
"hair stylist, danny rushed through a simple hair cut and did not ensure that my hair was even. i now have lines throughout my hair, never again sports clips. the only thing you have going for you is that you play sportscenter throughout the building."
i've been coming here for about a year and it's been a mixed of good and bad haircuts but lately it has been the latter. this hairstylist named britney cannot i repeat cannot cut hair. she has a bad attitude all the time and has already screwed up my hair twice.
hair stylist took over an hour to cut my hair then called for help. manager came and tried to salvage what was left of my hair of the terrible hair cut i received. it's been two months and and still my hair has grown evenly! all they offered was a free mvp upgrade ? so pretty much i paid for a terrible mess up they couldn't even fix. it's the worst comb over ever. the back side looked like i had a bowl hair cut.
last few times i was here they had a stylist who fudged up my hair so royally i told her she could never touch my hair again. ha. flash forward about 1 year. i still see some stylists that i'd seen time ago but i think these are the good ones that are still here. this time i had lisa cut my hair and she did a superb job. she cut it exactly the way i liked it so i thankfully think i have found someone in town who is worth visiting. a few more great visits and i'll change my review to 5 stars.
"i asked for a simple paid for my son. as you can see this is not a clean haircut. when i told them how i wanted it, she scoffed at the terminology i used. that should've been the first sign to leave right away. if you want a haircut that is clean, don't go here."
"been here twice now. each time i received a great haircut an using the mvp got a hot towel, shampoo and neck massage too. even though the place was busy both times (lunch hours) i was greeted warmly and served quickly. although they will use product in your hair of you want,they are not pushy with the sales pitch for it, which is nice. they also do a free touch-up service as well within a certain time window after your haircut."
"yelp really needs to add a no star option. we brought our son to get the ""mvp"" experience and boy were we disappointed. excuse my french, but the staff here sucks. i'm sure the other locations aren't as rude so we will take our buisness there. no greeting, no smiles and definitely no love.......some mvp experience most valueless personalities"
"dani is the best. i drive by 3 sports clips to see her. she is friendly, quick, and accurate."
"best haircut i've had in a while! crystal did an amazing job on my out of control hair. as usual the interior was awesome and clean. the staff is always friendly and skilled. i was in and out in about a half hour, which is pretty quick for most.i've been to many places to cut my hair over the years, i'm in love with sport clips!"
"5 stars for the service provided by jennifer.friendly, professional and quality work. i would highly recommend going here for a haircut and requesting that jennifer be your stylist. i also recommend that you go with the mvp. you will be treated like a star and leave very relaxed."
"this is probably the fastest i've gotten an mvp at a sports clips.  not complaining, but i guess i like the experience to be a little longer.  usually speedy haircut means bad haircut.  nope.  i went at the end of the work day too, so i'm sure the stylist was tired, but she did a great job.  after a cut and shampoo, i was out of there in probably 20 mins."
"i must have a weird head as i tend to get awful haircuts. anyways i went on post and the entire ait class was ahead of me. i left and searched for another barber shop that was open at 1100 on a sunday.  anyways, my son and i went to sports clips. i didn't wait long and i got a decent haircut.  i will probably go back. i have to admit the girls looked nothing like the ones in the advertisements, but otherwise everything was great."
went in for a haircut on my lunch break. don't know her name but one of the blonde stylists just was careless. hit my in the face with the cord for the sideburn trimmer and left dozens of hairs at different lengths on top. i've never had a bad experience with sports clips until now. i will never go to this location again.
"i got a really bad haircut here in december 2013. before that i had to go back to fix what another location(rim) missed. seems to be a trend with all sport clips, where it's all about numbers. i won't be going back. to any sport clips. ever."
"place is great! staff is courteous and are prompt to recognize you arrived to the store...greeting you. my husband cut his hair &was very quick, great service &clean."
"excellent place for guys' haircuts!  my boys have both come here in the past week and have come out looking great!!  the prices are reasonable, the place is absolutely spotless and everyone is super nice.  also, since it was their first time, they got the mvp treatment for the regular ""varsity"" price.  it included a cut, massaging shampoo, steamed towel and shoulder/back massage.  happy campers! :o)"
"always have a great experience at this location. the manager cuts my hair and always ensures it is right before she is done. consistent cut everytime, she is an outstanding stylist and highly recommend."
"i can expect the same haircut every time no matter who is working, same reasonable price."
"i always enjoy coming here. this is the only place me and my 3yr old son go. ask for claudia, she does an awesome job every time."
"waited 40 minutes to get my son in, it was busy when we got there. usually pretty good wait times. my son noticed one person got called that arrived after we did, i dismissed it, then they took a walk-in right back. after waiting that long my patience was gone. left and took him elsewhere and got him right in. i will never be going back to sport clips again."
always have a great stylist and haircut. great with the clippers.  i get a consistent cut even with different stylists.
"hair cuts for guys?! now that's what i'm talking about. tvs with sports and sports magazines and sports memorabilia if you want to buy some aggie banners. i've heard of other places offering a frosty brew as well for an additional $20 or so. no thanks, i don't need to drink beer at 11 o'clock in the morning on a tuesday, because that's usually when i steal away for a haircut. the ladies here are pros. no, not that kind of a pro. i expect their revolving door swings a bit more slowly based on how well they cut hair. they seem to have a knack for men's hair and i always get a great cut from them. by comparison once upon a time, many years ago in a fantastic sam's my ""stylist"" fresh out of cosmetology school immediately grabbed her clippers before even asking me how i wanted it cut. after i explained my scissor preference she replied "" oh, you gonna have all that wavy hair and stuff"", just before she butchered me in a way that took me back to my childhood and my aging barber in the shop with the hypnotic tri-colored pole out front. to make the occasion completely indelible to memory someone locked the door from without and we had to wait fifteen minutes for another employee to rescue us by sliding a spare key under the door. i could feel the stares of the other trapped customers as well as the employees towards my brutalized scalp. i felt like the kid down the street with piojos who got the mercy shave. no such treatment at sports clips. these people have it together and even offer free neck shaves from time to time as you need them. yuk! dude if you need a neck shave in between cuts, i might want to keep that a little more private. you will also get the scalding hot towel on the face and a solid massaging shampoo. ahhhhhh."
"been coming here for about a year now. the customer service is good. haircuts are hit or miss depending on who i get, however. i like the shampoo they use. not much else to say about this place."
great place for a haircut. i'm pretty picky about my haircut and every time i come here my haircut turns out great.
first time at this location and i had better service than i have at other locations. i got taken care of quickly and got a free mvp for it being my first time.
kind lady but worst haircut i've gotten in a long time. asked for a simple skin medium fade and to trim top if needed. she spent 30 mins trying to fade my hair. i finnaly had to ask how much longer then she said 3 mins. when she was done she had messed up the top  i had to ask another lady to fix it. she cut it up in mins. i left unhappy and not satisfied with how my hair is now. will not be back here.
"worst haircut experience ever... for my almost 3 year old and myself. ivette moved so slow my son quickly lost interest (him sitting in a salon chair has never once been an issue- he has gone every 2-3 weeks since he was 1!). then, instead of dusting the hair trimmings off like a normal stylist, she hits him with a blow dryer multiple times, covering him (and myself- sitting a chair away) in hair! who does that?! he was so irritable and itching his back, neck, and face the entire time. i finally picked him up and held him still so she could finish. we were there for far too long and then had to pay $15 for a 3 year olds haircut! we left with a crappy cut, both of us covered in hair, and a rash from all the hair that was blown down his shirt. on a positive note- the other woman working in there completed two men's cuts while my toddler wiggled miserably in ivette's chair. she did not blow their hair trimmings all over them either....  avoid ivette and you'll probably be ok!"
"absolute trash haircut from pattie. pretty much insulted me from start to finish. came in and she said my hair was off center, she fixed it now it looks so bad i've had to shave my head. more than that she told me the whole time how bad my eczema was. next she told me i have a midwestern accent, when i told her i was from california she just argued with me. it was all just obscene and abrasive and strange. run from pattie, terrible experience."
"myriah is very nice but gives very bad haircuts (picture attached).  manager was great she fixed it for me, but i think she should've offered to at least refund me my tip."
"the staff is extremely nice, but they are horrible at giving haircuts. when i ask for a certain cut, don't do it the way you think it should be. do what i asked for. both times i went, i asked for a certain way, and both times they went their own route. although they're extremely nice, i won't be going back after two times of awful haircuts. maybe they just can't do fades, i don't know."
"i have been coming here once a week for the past 18 months to get hair cuts. i know all of their staff very well. if you as an individual can't see that your hair isn't the way you want it until you drive home, then that is on you. i always get a nice high fade with a sub zero that draws many complements at work and around town. i encourage anyone that wants a good experience to come here for a cut."
great looking shop and great stylists! the staff is very friendly and always provide a excellent haircut. the mvp is an awesome experience. go sportclips!!
"this is the only place that can get my son's hair right consistently. we were tired of the bowl cut, and finally found a place that knows how to get that ""skater cut"" look right.for a little extra, he can get a hot towel neck massage with his professionally done look.the customer service has always been fast and friendly during the week. the weekend is a little bit of a wait, but they do have a tv playing entertainment with comfy chairs while you wait.these ladies have taken a situation that once caused nervous anxiety for both of us to an enjoyable experience, and a young man who can now leave without a bag over his head."
"brought my son in to get a haircut earlier. nice work, very polite staff. will definitely be returning soon."
took my 10 year old in to get a cut. stood and waited to be greeted for 5 minutes. nothing. man and son walks in and she goes right to them and takes them right away (white folks). they appeared not to be happy to see my black son looking to get a cut. life has taught me when i'm not welcome. i turned and walked out. unfortunately it's not the first time i've tried a barbershop and got this response.  i usually do my homework to be sure the place is black friendly (able and willing to cut black hair)hopefully i can save some other black family the insult.
"this place in theory is a great escape for a man or son to have their hair cut, especially with the option to have their hair washed in the back. my son thought he was special having that done. but unfortunately this place is hit or miss with stylists. some are great while some have left my husband with an uneven cut or fade."
"i've been coming to this location for years and always received great service! i've got my stylist who knows my preferences and we always enjoy visiting. the location is convenient and there's rarely a wait. great haircut, good friend and sports - almost everything one needs when getting a haircut. i highly recommend this sports clips location."
seemed to be more like a local barbershop than your typical chain brand. i've been to several sports clip location and this one was very friendly
"went in for the 1st time today and won't be back. i showed her a picture of what i wanted for my son and i showed her how i wanted it styled. she left it too long on the bottom. i had a feeling she was going to, so i asked her is it going to be a little shorter later and she said yes she was going to go back and do that part later, well at the end of the cut it was still to long and you could hardly even tell he had a new cut. i didn't want to be rude and come right out and ask her to do it again so i just asked her to put it in the notes next time for it to be a a little shorter and to do a 1 up to a 2 and she said sure i'll put it in there, didn't offer to go back and fix it. i showed her two pics of how i wanted it and after cutting the top she just combed it over!? i showed her how i liked the front styled up and she didn't use any products and didn't style it at all!? i styled it my self in the parking lot for him. i paid extra to take him here because i thought they would know more and be more up to date with the current styles but to be honest he got a better hair cut from great clips for half the price last time. like i said this was my first time there and it'll be my last time, very unhappy, wish i would have went to a real barber shop."
my son has been going there for a few years now.  they are fast and professional.  he is always happy with the cut.
"the cut for my son was pretty good.   shorter than we asked but good quality. however, my son had his hair washed with cold water and got not hot towel.  when i pay $22 for a haircut at sport clips, i expect something better, including a hot towel.  i probably won't be going back again since the hot towel is the whole reason i would go to sport clips, & getting your hair washed not in cold water is kind of a bare minimum."
"do. not. visit. this. location!!!i brought my seven year old nephew here to get his haircut the other day and instead of leaving with a fresh new cut he left with brutally disturbing marks and scars around his skull.the hair stylist failed to take precaution while edging and this caused scarring and scabbing on my nephew's head. he was bleeding and wincing throughout the cut then was told he simply had ""sensitive skin""not only am i disgusted at the possibility of there being other customer's blood on the blade they used that sliced into his head, but also offended that not one employee or manager has reached out or responded to my phone calls or e-mails about this horrendous and life-scarring occurrence."
to be short: i had to touch up my hair when i got home. i will probably not use sports clips again.
"the staff here was amazing! i am from dallas and i am visit here for the weekend, compared to the locations in dallas, i felt that this place was top of the line. my stylist was asking questions to make sure i was happy. she was super personable and did a great job. she upgraded my to mvp, just because she was frustrated with the dallas locations not providing a good service!"
"i came here today for the first time and the woman who cut my hair was very good at her job but also is very kind. i don't remember her name but she has a little girl who graduates from preschool tomorrow. the young lady who cut my hair did a better job than even other sports clips i have been to. she took her time, for those of us with thick and wiry hair it's important, and went over difficult areas several times. needless to say, she did an incredible job and i will return because of her customer service and attention to detail with my difficult hair."
they always do a nice job and are friendly. sometimes the wait gets a bit long but for not making an appointment it goes fast enough. they have a great product line and the mvp with wash and massage it worth it.
"i've had mixed experiences here so i'll detail each shortly:first time i came here, jason was my barber and he did an excellent job.  most franchised barbershops don't usually cut ""ethnic"" hair properly nor do they understand common trends (i.e. a taper fade).  jason nailed it!  i would like to formally give him recognition for his great attitude and barber skills and i highly recommend him. the second time i dropped in jason wasn't there and some lady was my barber and she completely botched it and actually didn't cut it at the right measurements - i usually get my hair cut really short because it grows fast and she completely disregarded the measurements i told her and unfortunately on this particular morning, i had to be at work and didn't have time for her to go back and correct it.  the past few times i've visited this location have been on monday mornings and it seems like management is doing a poor job of matching labor to business traffic. each time the floor has been full with at least 4 people in the waiting room.  in other words, this may not be the place if you're on a time crunch."
"bad bad day today at sports clips on huebner oaks. i came in to get a haircut around 10:30 this morning. ive been coming here since 2005. ive had this location rated at 5 stars but after dealing with the smart mouth of this girl i know she's only been at this location less than a year i have no choice but to drop the store's rating.just to be fair, ive had this little girl cut my hair a few months back. she didn't cut it the way i wanted it but didnt make a big fuss about it. she's not who i normally get to cut my hair but there were only two stylists all together.she eventually called my name and when i sat on her chair she started reading the notes from previous times ive been there. i told not to focus on that because that's why i get my hair cut wrong and i offered to show her a picture of me when they cut it the way i like it. she said she can only go by those notes and looking at a picture wouldn't help her get an idea how i like my hair. im 41 years old and i have never had a stylist impose their ineptituds on me. so when i questioned her, her immediate answer was that i can go somewhere else. so i did. needles to say, not coming back. which sucks because there are other stylists at this location that know what they're doing. i'll post her picture so hopefully management takes care of this problem. girls like her belong working at hooters because she is a cutie but doesnt ""make the cut"" as a stylist."
"i have been to this location mutliple times & always experience horrible attitudes (from all but two of the stylists).  i went in on 7/1 for a trim & in addition to dealing with horrible attitude i received a horrible haircut.  she cut way more off than i asked for, completely changing my look (not for the better).  the two stylists i mentioned having good attitudes gave amazing haircuts as well (i wish i could remember their names, one is an older hispanic lady & the other is a young red haired lady).  my last experience, and sportclips lack of response to this issue, has me looking for a new barber; which is unforutnate because i have been a sportclips customer for over 9 years, but this last experience was truly horrendous enough to never return (and this location & corporate have failed to even reach out to offer an apology."
"i've been here several times over the past couple months and each time they botched the cut in a different way. this last time they managed to fade my hair all the way to the top of my head. like... i've literally never seen a fade this jacked up. i would be impressed if i wasn't so pissed. if you're older than twelve, chances are this place isn't for you."
they don't listen just use the razor and shave everything off and not even very good at that. after leaving i see many spots she missed. all they are trying to do is flip customers. i
do not go here they don't know how to cut hair took my hairline up and then blamed it on the shape of my head
i usually go to the one at sonterra cause i've known that stylist for years however i went to this location on saturday and arrived at about 20 minutes till 7:00 which is the time they're supposed to close i requested marisela and therefore had to wait got in the seat about 20 minutes till 8:00 and never felt rushed or pressured about being there way past closing time the stylist did an awesome job with my hair and took her time which i must admit i was concerned about getting rushed out not the case at all the other employees were just as patient and professional it's customer service and employees like those girls that night that create an awesome experience and repeat customers definitely my new go to sport clips
"the worst franchise haircut store.i am a year long customer in this store, and the experience wasn't the best but wasn't the worst either. today, a girl (who had a piercing on a tongue) did my haircut. and she was rushing through my haircut as if she was trying to get rid of me from the store. she didn't even ask how my neck part would be trimmed (which is something they usually asked: rounded or square, and i always get rounded). this time she did it square without asking me, and she couldn't fix it because it's already trimmed.also she was spinning my chair often just so she didn't have to move herself to cut my other side of hair. how lazy and rude is that.later, i realized there were many other customers in front of me, and she was just trying to earn one more customer's tip by finishing my haircut as fast as she can; basically stealing other hairstylist's customers. unbelievable.never going to this store again."
"the lady did a horrible job on my hair.  she asked if i wanted my part slightly defined, so i said yes.  instead of finding and cutting where my hair naturally parted, she just went and made a new part."
"i've had inconsistent haircuts here over the past several months.  generally, i have found the haircut length, etc. to be appropriate.  however, i have had issues with details like sideburns being cut to different lengths and uneven trim along the neck line.  due to the convenient location, i may continue going here if i'm crunched for time, but will try other places as well."
great haircut and good price with nearly no wait. i've been here several times over the last month and have been happy with the cut and service each time. i recommend to everyone.
been coming here around 6 months and this has to be the best place ive been to for pampering.  jessica knows what she is doing i highly recommend her to anyone that want a great cut.
"after using the same barber for over 20 years, i ventured out to try something new and closer to my work. sport clips is a chain of hair-cutting stores that are staffed by stylists mostly of the female species and the decor of the place is you guessed it, sport themed. i almost didn't give this place a shot, but went ahead and was surprised at the job my stylist did. it was like she had cut my hair for years and the best part of the experience was getting the wash and hot face towel/massage. that is something that i never been offered at my barber's place. give it a try. i have been to a few different stylists over the months and my favorite are in this order: alexa, celinda and diana. all do a great job for me and i am sure the others do too, i just haven't had a chance to try them yet."
"refused to cut my hair when i wouldn't give them my full telephone number.  it's a haircut, wtf"
"two-thumbs down!i'm a pretty clean cut guy with hair that's about as easy as it comes per cutting.  while everyone gets a crappy haircut once in a while...okay it happens, but....the lady that was butchering my hair didn't listen to a word i said when i told her how i wanted it cut!  i think she decided in her mind of minds how my hair would look best if she cut it how she felt.blah!my instructions were pretty complicated i guess, ""take about an inch off the top""translation for her i guess was, ""leave about an inch on top""blah again!"
got a haircut by briana. she was great and friendly. overall it was great and good hair cut. i've been going to sport clips for 3 years but never here. i will be back. only bad thing i have to say is that the sign in window said no wait and i waited 25 minutes for a haircut and but the time i left there were a lot of people waiting. all staff was friendly and good stylist. all the equipment was in good shape and store was very clean. if you don't mind waiting it's worth it.
cool place to get a good hair cut was in and out in a short amount of time.people were extremely nice and my do came out great.
"pretty nice place to get a haircut. the employees have a great attitude about working an good environment to get a haircut. although overall it is just a sportsclips. if youre picky about your hair, prolly not the best choice. but if youre looking for a basic cheap haircut then this is a very good choice for it."
sport clips in point loma is great!! all the ladies there are friendly and very helpful if you have any questions about the product they sell. great hair cuts and service!!
"sarah at the point loma shop was very friendly and explained everything to as a first time customer. i am used to an old school barber shop with an old school decor and vibe inside with old school hours (which made it hard for me to get in for hair cut due to my work schedule. i was in awe of atmosphere with tv's with sport on them all around you. i thought sarah was amazing as she took her time and made sure i was satisfied with my haircut and beard trim. it was nice to have soft gentle hands touch me vs the big rough n' brawly man hands of my old barber. the hot towel, shampoo wash with head massage was icing on the cake! definitely my new place for haircuts and i will be requesting sarah! it's nice to see a modern day barber shop for guy... sports clips is like a day spy designed for guys, love it!"
this place has become my go to for haircuts. every other place i've been to is hit or miss every time i go and just want to get you in and out as fast as possible. the staff here have all been very friendly and i've yet to be unhappy with a haircut. it feels very worth the extra two or three bucks for consistently perfect haircuts and great service.
"visited for my second time. first time was good, i was looking forward to becoming a regular. nice stylist, good haircut, close location to me, good value. i arrived today. it was busy with a customer in each chair. i signed in on the empty sign-in sheet and sat down knowing i would be next. then a guy comes in and says he was already signed in. a call out from the back... ""you will be next"". ok i suppose. he was here before me. then a second... then a third. same thing, 'i already signed in', 'ok, you'll be third'.if there was a sign-in sheet with three guys before me i could have determined if i wanted to wait or not... but to allow me to sit there for 15 minutes and announce one-by-one that others will be seen before me is simply insulting.either leave the filled up sign-in sheet there or tell the wanderers they lost their place because they left. you've lost a client."
"i like this chain, they have a good business model and provide good service for a decent price. i always go for the mvp treatment, which includes shampoo, head massage, hot towel and shoulder massage. this particular location does a great job. i've liked both the stylists i've had since moving to sd. parking has always been easy, and i've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes."
great long layers and face framing from one of the stylist. professional conversation and nice appearance from all the stylists.
"husband has gone to a sports clips once before, so we tried this location, i cannot describe how upset i am with the quality of the hair cut, two completely different lengths on top, my husband has a natural wave in his hair, and the hairdresser (natalie) thinned out his hair, causing the cut to look lopsided no matter what we attempt to do to fix it, and the fade isn't fully blended, the only way to make it even now would be a buzz cut. severely disappointed, not worth $22"
"nice people, the staff was great, friendly and professional, i got the mvp and i really liked how they wash your hair and do the massage after your cut, it made you feel cleaner after the cut, than getting it before, it removes all the sm.hairs so you are not itchy from them falling off your head and down your shirt on the way home.  i like the whole mvp experience!! i wish my hair grew faster so i could come more often."
"i don't understand why there are so many negative reviews, staff is always friendly, fast, and courteous.  my son always like this place, they have his hair cut preferences in there computer so it's always a quick chat as to what he wants, and if he changes it up every so often, it's never a problem.  i myself have long hair so i rarely get hair cuts, but when i do i come here, no expensive $60 price like other places that cut long hair, massage, wash, and good looking women, what else could the clientele want?also a couple times, i've come in with coffee and a danish just to watch tv while my wife did some grocery shopping next store, never an issue with the staff."
"there are actual experts giving the haircut. sarah was a professional who knew how to give me the haircut that could get that second look. also the products i was offered there to style my hair will last me as long as, if not longer, than my next dozen haircuts."
"i bring my son here for his haircuts. they do a great job. he likes coming here for the mvp experience. which is just a few dollars more for a shampoo, scalp massage, & hot towel. my son loves it!i would give them 5 stars if the service was better. it's been my experience that no one greets you when you walk in. you just sign in & wait. if the women were a bit more welcoming & friendly, it would be appreciated."
"this review is for johanna, and i meant to write it about a month ago. sports clips is decent as a franchise in general, where you can get a fairly decent cut at a fairly decent price. i have been to multiple locations, and pretty much go there when i don't want to spend the money on a more expensive cut, but have never been blown away by the experience. johanna was my last stylist, and she turned me into a loyal fan. first off, she actually cut my hair damn near perfectly in terms of what i wanted, and we had a great conversation about life. during this conversation, i learned of her dedication to the business and her owners where she works very hard and takes her job seriously. she dreams of owning her own franchise one day and i have no doubt she will make that happen. she is exactly the kind of person who takes a mundane business and adds layers of awesomeness to make you want to come back. bravo."
"back again for another haircut. wait was not too long, my stylist was very helpful and professional..."
rebekah gave a superb haircut per usual! she did exactly what was requested. scissor cut all around and a little longer in the front. she's always nice and pleasant. such relaxing mvp. we'll done.
"amazing job by every one of the girls who work here! always friendly and good service. i have had my hair cut by almost every person who works at this location and they all do a great job. michelle was my stylist today and it was great as always. happy with the service and the haircut. good conversation and a professional job, what more can you ask for.location is good, convenient and almost always parking available."
"johanna is the best! yes, i am a female that goes to sports clips. i followed johanna to this establishment once she stopped working at another salon. i go in about every two months for a trim. tuesday i went in and got several inches cut off so i got to go back in the locker room and get a wash, it was great! i loved the massage chairs with the hot towel on the face. also liked the hand held massager she used on my shoulders. men, if you're looking for a great place to get a haircut i recommend this location and ask for johanna. all of her customers look great & leave smiling once they're finished."
"great customer service and hardly ever a wait! this has quickly become my ""go to"" barbershop in san diego. the location is great, and the ladies do a fantastic job every time i come in for a visit. i've been going to sport clips consistently for the last three months and this one ranks up at the top. my first visit i was welcomed in with open arms and offered discounts for my military service. they are extremely military friendly here at this particular location. violeta was my first stylist, and she was near perfect. there are tons of great hair products here for men. if you want value size tea tree shampoo, this is your spot. there's a 66 fl oz bottle that will last you a few months if you're doing it right. like all sport clips, you have the option of getting your hair washed with a head massage, and a shoulder massage. this is known as the mvp. i don't know about you, but after a long day at work, a little relaxation like that goes a long way.i've only left this sport clips looking and feeling better than when i entered, so i'll be going back until that trend comes to an end."
"as a first timer i was offered a light massage and shampooing which worked seamlessly after a quick haircut. workers were professional and on point for each customer entering. the wait could be a problem, as a few gentlemen had come and left before my time arrived. worth the wait this time, but not so sure another. happy with my results."
"enjoy the mvp treatment. super friendly employees, great haircut. highly recommend."
"i've seen sportsclips around before but never went in to one. this place is great!  sports, sports, sports on all tvs. my stylist gave me the mvp treatment which includes a neck massage, hot towel facial, shampoo and haircut.  i felt like a new man when i left, and got several compliments on my cut. johanna, the manager, is the happiest most optimistic person i met in the service industry. i will be back."
"this place is "" absolutely amazing ""!  i've lived in rancho del rey for 18 years now and never knew the level of care and customer service they offered.  they treat you like royalty! the bar has been set sky high! i always judge a business from the moment i enter the doors and they get 5 stars across the board! a simple hair cut turned into a mini spa day! lourdes is awesome! she put a hot mint towel on my face as she washed my hair, followed by a quick back massage.  she not only had me looking good .... she also had me feeling rejuvenated!  i highly recommend this place.  you will not be disappointed!  plenty of bang for your buck! it's important to get great service these days.  #loyal #customer"
"hello ,since many years it was my son's favorite place,yesterday we went and the stylist lady refuse to give him a haircut saying he had to some  flakes, i show it to her it was from the excess of  gel ,my son felt very bad about it , she was not nice and she shouldn't do it,i will agree if somebody have a contiguous infection or so but not because of this,my son wash his hair every day .my son is 15 years old i will never go back to this place."
"this place is great! stopped while my wife was shopping. so friendly! my stylist jessie was fantastic. definitely my new spot for me and my songot in out quick, now i don't have to wait in the car while she shops! highly recommended"
"i bring my sons here (4 and 9). they don't sit still. at all. however, no matter who has cut their hair, they always leave looking perfect. i will say that the level of friendliness and professionalism has gone up exponentially the last time we went (may 2017). prior to this, grumpy was what you received with your great haircut. i highly recommend bridget. she is the opposite of grumpy. she engages with my boys and is bubbly and kind. we'll be back soon."
"today while in between business i took my son to have his hair cut. jennifer greeted us with a smile and interacted with my son very well.she asked me how i would like his hair cut, from his bangs, to his sides, the back & his little side burns.she was really friendly and inviting.she gave him the best haircut i have seen so far.we will be back !thank you jennifer!!!"
"i asked for a low fade with about a third cut off the top.  i also asked for the top to be rounded(dense curly hair) and a line-up. first the fade wasn't blended really at all. there were spots left off and the cut seemed to have no real attention to detail. the top was a mess. the woman who cut my hair scissor cut my hair barely combing it out, which was an alarming sign that this individual had limited experience on curly hair like mine. ultimately, it led to a very uneven cut on the top(my hair looked more like a triangle than rounded). the lineup was ultra fast and awful. the lady, instead of lining it up top to bottom, she lined it up bottom to the line if that makes sense. this just pushed my baby hairs back to make it seem like i recieved a lineup. the massage and the spa like treatment serves as a distraction to that sub-par(at best) haircut that you had just recieved. now i am not bashing on the lady. i do believe she did the best she could have with such limited experience, however it was mind boggling on the lack of detail assigned to this cut. i seriously recommend that there is extensive training on how to properly cut all types of hair. i will say that sports clips is a great place for anyone who probably isnt too concerned or their haircut isn't too demanding and for one to have a good hospitable environment to be surrounded by. by the way, my hair is fixed now by a barber who knows what they are doing so dont worry about me."
"this is not a place i plan on revisiting.  i took both my kids for haircuts. one of the stylists was friend and took the time to make sure his cut looked good, which is why they didn't just get one star.  my other son the stylist was not friendly and spent most of the time watching tv and not cutting hair. maybe she didn't like kids, but couldn't be bothered talking to him.  i felt like him being in her chair was a huge inconvenience. *someone reached out to apologize and my son asked to go back. the next visit was so much better!"
long wait times. come off peak hours so you don't sit and wait. this place is where to go when your son out grows the kid salon  pigtails & crewcuts.
i recently went here and got my haircut and they did a great job. they did it in a timely fashion and were very helpful.
"i can only vouch for jessica she knows how to cut hair. she is bomb and i don't mind waiting for her to cut my sons hair. it's a decent price, fair for eastlake. my son is super particular too, so this is a major recommendation."
"this place sucks. the women are rude, they suck at cutting hair and they'll expect a huge tip for the nothing they barely do. most recently, the event that provoked me to write this review, is when i took my children (i have two boys and one girl) to this shop hoping they'd cut my daughters hair the way she wants (she's in middle school but identities as a boy, which should be respected by everyone) and i got denied service! i repeat, they denied me service flat out. when i asked to talk to a manager, i was told by the manager that they don't cut female hair, & when i tried to explain the situation i got asked to leave. it's 2015, approaching 2016 and my transgender daughter got refused service. this place is disgusting and i will boycott it until the day i die."
from when you first walk in you're greater and tended to immediately. you notice right away this is not your typical barber/ hair salon. everyone there is really nice and they offer a variety of services to meet anyone's needs. i recommend any guy to go there. once yougo there you'll never want to get your hair cut anywhere else.
"i give five stars for one stylist who always does a great job cutting my hair and doesn't make pointless conversation. for me jessica is the best. i can sit in silence and watch whatever game is on tv. she remembers how i like my hair and gets it done quick and clean. i don't want to be friends with my hair stylist, i just want them to cut my hair.sheena is good too, but i wouldn't chance anyone else. i've had some bad cuts here with other stylist. no matter where you go there are always a few bad apples."
"so my job took me away from my home town sd where i was born and raised and i started using sports clips in az and loved it. great customer service which is odd because az is not known for customer service at all people hate their lives in az and it reflects in their service in most things. but the service was better, the haircuts were better and the price was less if i remember correctly. now we're near $30 for an mvp which is pathetic because you get 2 minuntes if youre lucky of a massage you spend and extra $10 for and the customer service from this elderly lady (my age 50+) was horrid the buzz cut i got was worse the the $5 buzz cuts i used to get in the navy. i changed a year ago from sportsclips eastlake due to subpar cuts and horrid waste of money 2 minute massages that aren't worth it to gent's corner by the mall. i had a couple shady cuts there until i met patrick and his cuts have been flawless every time. so, i say it's a new year sportsclips sent me $5 off so 22 vice 27 woohoo im treating myself to an mvp. biggest mistake of this new year.  first don't bother paying for the mvp if you come here it's not ever been worth it here and second if you want a real haircut you might as well go somewhere where they care about what they're doing because this lady certainly didn't care about me or my hair.  good riddance!"
"walked in with my husband and two boys  and stood in the front for about 5 min. nobody greeted us. decided to sit in waiting area. still no acknowledgement at all. there were four girls cutting hair and not a single one even smiled at us or said hello. i understand they were busy but there was a very unfriendly vibe. would it hurt to acknowledge a customer and say ""we will be right with you"" ??? walked out after 10 minutes and won't be back."
"i took my son to this sports clips, i had been to one before, but told myself i would never go there again because the service was horrible and so was the cut. i decided to give it another shot and i am so glad that i did! jessica, i believe that's her name, was so amazing. my son was nervous about getting his haircut there again, but this time was different. my son cannot wait to go back and i just wanted to take the time to let sports clips know that if it wasn't for her, i wouldn't return. see you soon jessica, i told all my friends to come find you!"
i was hoodwinked. first time i went in there as a new customer i was given the royal treatment and upgraded for free. i tipped $15 and subsequently three other haircuts after that i tip $10 each time based on a decent job. my last haircut prior with denise was fine but overall friendliness with conversation was void for some reason. i tipped her $5 and felt guilty. i go in three days ago request sheena while waiting probably 30 minutes as i was next in line and she proceeded to take another customer who could have gone with another stylist about 1 minute later and i ended up waiting even longer. i walked out vowing never to return. i did call sheena and she apologized but obviously i wasn't of any priority or importance...even though i've been loyal. something happened to the overall friendliness in that place as i became just a number i suppose.
"kinda disappointed...came here for a trim a few months ago and a barber (stylist?) named jaimee killed it. gave me a phenomenal haircut which just adds to my disappointment when 2 months later, a different lady cuts my hair and leaves my bangs too long then i go in a few days later to get it touched up and now my bangs are too short!! i look like shit. i'm gonna have to buzz my head to look halfway decent now. they touched it up for free, so at least they have good customer service but i recommend calling ahead to get a stylist you like cuz you're kinda playing russian roulette w/your hair here."
"worst haircut by far! i could have give myself this haircut! there were two ladies in there and 3 clients walked in and none of them sat those people. literally those guys waited about 20 minutes to sit in a chair! i paid 22 bucks for something i could have done, i asked for a shorter haircut because i was growing my hair out for a specific cut, and she buzzed my head! worst by far!"
"worse service ever! my husband took my son yesterday for the first time, and this lady with blonde hair (i wish i had her name) was the most unprofessional, and rude person ever! i don't know why she is working on this field where you need to have good costumer service. as soon as they walked in, she looked like she didn't want to be there, not even a little smile...never going back."
"fast, efficient, and great cuts! web check-in is a plus. helen is one of the best i've had cut my hair but can say that i've never had a bad cut from anyone there. (although i've had a few at other establishments...)"
"very good, if it's slow.if you check in online, expect to wait if they get busy in the interim. if you find a good stylist, stay with them. there is high variability in the quality of the haircut and experience depending on who you get. i checked in online and then waited 28 minutes beyond the recommended arrival time. while i was waiting, the chatter amongst the unoccupied staff was a bit annoying. speaking about relationships and other personal information i'd rather not have heard. this was among the stylists who did not have customers. i really don't need to hear about someone's relationship issues loudly spoken for the whole room to hear. anyway, i used up my last season ticket today and i must say, the haircut quality is above average. however, the waiting time and the drama i don't need. i wish this facility all the best. i'd recommend you let people book appointments so they aren't wasting time waiting. if you're afraid of wasted appointments, make the client place a non-refundable down payment to book."
"i continue to go here. in fact, i got a haircut yesterday. the new online check in works well. when i got to the store, i didn't have to check in again. i was able to choose my haircutter (jenny) and i received a time that i should show up at the store. worked pretty dang well. i was also able to add a guest to my ticket (through online checkin), which is nice. i added my son, who went right after me. it was his first haircut at sports clips and jenny did a terrific job. my son says that he no longer wants his mom to cut his hair! i guess that's that. anyhow, the old manager is still at this location. she still doesn't seem very happy. and i still get the feeling that employees are more at ease and happy when she isn't there. i hope that manager finds happiness in her life!"
"i have been going to this location since it opened. i have seen a gradual decline in service and a not so gradual incline in the price. i had always requested a ""triple play"" cut which was slightly lower in price than the mvp because the 3 minute back massage to me was not worth it.on my last visit i was told that the triple play was no longer an option and it would either be a haircut for $22 or mvp for $27.  after the computerized checkout kiosk suggests a tip, we're talking $32.i am not sure if other sportclip locations are following suit, but this will be my last visit here. the stylists are nice but i think the management does not understand that customer choice is important."
"love the mvp - it's an experience- after the haircut you get a relaxing shampoo in a massage chair with a steamed towel on your face, and neck and shoulder massage with a professional grade massage machine. all the stylists do a great job. i always stop in for a free neck trim in between haircuts too. this place is the real deal!"
"this is by far the best ""barber shop"" i have been to. i have lived in scripps ranch for 18 years now and this is the only place i will ever get my haircut at. the customer service is superb and all of the employees are extremely friendly and i have even made close friends with some of the employees. the place is always extremely clean and i get the pleasure of watching sports while i am getting my hair cut. my favorite barber is lola as she has years of experience and you can tell she knows exactly what you want and will work with you to ensure you are satisfied by the end of the haircut. i would and do recommend this place to anyone and everyone in the area or just visiting. i love you lola!"
we won't be going here anymore.  all the good stylists are gone.   we've had numerous experiences here where a every stylist insists that they can cut black hair but that's not true. my son's hair has been lined up crookedly or with uneven lengths in his hair.   the last time a stylist had to have the manager finish and fix my son's haircut.  i guess these ladies cannot admit their own limitations.  this week we called a day in advance and came during the hours they told us the manager donna would be there and when we got there we were told the she was leaving early and could not cut my son's hair.  she was still there and insisted that anyone could do it.  not true and so unprofessional.  so having had so many bad experiences here at scripps location we left without a hair cut.  so disappointing to have such bad customer service from a manager.  you just lost a customer.
complete shit.does not listen.  does not now what a fade is either.  took a 1 all the way up to the crown.  paid 25 dollars for something a lawnmower didwent home and buzzed it off.do not come here!!!
service at this location is really a hit or miss. you either get a good haircut with a good barber - or in my most recent case - someone who can barely speak english and completely butchers your haircut. i'm not sure who i had - but they literally like did what they thought they wanted even after i told them what i wanted. completely screwed up my hair and i don't recommend here.
"i love coming to sport clips. i have had the same person a couple of times, but it's always a great experience no matter what. love the mvp as well!"
"i came here on saturday april 30th to get my haircut (obviously, that's why i went).  it was mid-day and it was what you would expect for the level of business for that time of day and for being the weekend.  i had been here a couple times before with no complaints and my complaint isn't necessarily with the establishment itself because i've been to another location and have had great experiences.  my complaint is specifically with the manager which just so happened to be the person cut my hair.  from the very get go my experience was horrible.  the stylist said hi, but didn't smile. we proceeded to talk about what i had wanted and i had even showed her a picture.  she didn't say anything and kind of looked at me like i wasn't making sense so i had asked her if she understood because she didn't respond to what i was talking about.  from there the service was just downhill.  i looked around and saw all the other stylists engaging their patrons.  mine didn't say one word to me.  she looked flustered.  i don't know if she was having a bad day or if it was normal for her to be so rude.  but....it got worse.  she rushed through my haircut and it was absolutely an awful haircut.  i prefer scissors but she used a buzzer and comb.  she was slamming her cupboards.  she was extremely rough with my head and was pulling at my hair an unwarranted amount.  she didn't smile.  half way through she asked my what i was up to for the day but it seemed forced.  i was so irritated that it was difficult for me to answer the question.  i wanted the vip treatment but after my haircut i was so done with her that i cancelled it and just wanted to pay and go.  i asked the clerk at the counter if i could speak with the manager and she just pointed to the lady who cut my hair.  really?  that's the manager!?  what a horrible role model and leader you are for your staff members.  i complained to the assistant manager outside who was incredibly nice and heard my concerns.  to the manager:  have some pride in what you do.  if not find another line of work.  be a leader and show your co-workers how to engage with other customers the right way.  all your other stylists looked like they were having fun - take some notes from them.   the assistant manager encouraged me to come back for a free haircut but honestly i don't know if i'll be back to that location.  the manager should be fired."
"no matter what location i go too, i always get treated like an mvp which i love. sport clips will always be one of my favorite hair cut spots, i get to watch sports center while getting my haircut, add on a hot steam towel, back massage as well as a head rub and you got yourself a happy camper. thanks for always making my experience great! i definitely recommend coming and getting the mvp experience if you have yet to try it out, you will thank me later."
"beware/avoid: the little old ill mannered hot tempered lady (aka the manager).came in saturday, june 4th to get  my 20-month old son's head shaved. the barber was friendly, and i want to make it clear this review is not about the barber, but directed to her ill-mannered manager. the barber nipped my sons scalp. it bled, but ok let's move on because my son was crying from the top of his lungs, and it would have been hard for any barber. the barber was apologetic, and said she will see what the mgr can do about it. the staff tried to help the situation w lollipops, balloons, etc.finally, they rang me up full price. so i asked the reception what was the verdict between the barber and the mgr? she was timid in answering and had the mgr talk to me. this little old lady who is in her late 40s-50s came charging at me with words loaded like a machine gun....'there is always risk in shaving a child's head without a guard...and even more so with the way your son was acting!"" she just kept coming at me repeating what she said in variations. her words, tone, and attitude completely threw me off my game... what happened to the nice staff i was dealing with?! there was almost no end in her verbal regurgitation... so i finally put my foot down and told her straight out - i specifically asked what are the dangers to shaving with a 0 (no guard), and the barber told me there is no danger at all, she does this all the time, and she too has a 6 month old baby at home so she knows what it's like....this hot headed mgr finally softened up a little and said well i didn't know you asked the barber all those questions but still there are still risks , and continued her rant. i said listen i asked all the questions i needed to ask to ensure my sons safety and if you say there is no danger at all then i believe you because as a female i have never had to shave my own head before and i trust what you as a professional says. she turns to the receptionist and says what do you want to do?? the receptionist said she will remove $5 from the cut. the little old ill mannered hot tempered mean lady said that's too much for a nip! and threw a coupon at the receptionist for $2 off , and turned to me and said ""well at least he looks cute!"" damn old manager lady! you are lucky your entire staff is nice ! i don't know how you are in the business of consumer service with no idea what customer service is. you didn't have to give me a discount, just don't give me grief. i would have been fine with an apology , compassion, or a grain of sympathy . any type of lip service would have made any mother whose son was bleeding on the scalp feel better. but you thought it be appropriate to put the blame back on my son, and my ignorance of what no guard meant... and that is why you will always be that little old ill mannered hot temper lady cutting hair.  i pity you!"
we love this sport clips location. the staff and manager are always friendly. my boys get super cute cuts and they treat their customers with respect!
"after sitting there for 20 minutes and seeing people start to go ahead of me i asked how many more appointments there were before me, a walk in, would get a haircut. apparently there is a sign in sheet to get service?! how amature is that? not greeted by anyone and definitely not told i had to sign in to get service...i am sorry this is my first visit here, but seriously how about, ""good morning, are you here for a haircut? make sure to sign in...""but no, now i have wasted my lunch hour on a fruitless journey to sport clips...the minor leagues of hair cut establishments."
"been here a few times, but exceptionally poor service when i was in this morning. no acknowledgement, no estimate of wait time, particularly if you're going to call people before me that came in after. i understand if they called ahead or something, but you need to open your mouth and communicate."
nora is the best i am so glad she is back.  she makes my haircuts last months. i have cowlicks so most people make my hair do crazy things when there done.  nora your the best keep up the hard work.
great place for haircuts! my son and husband both go to fiona for haircuts and she does a great job. i like that i can call when i'm on my way so we don't have sit and wait.
"alright fellas.  i usually like to keep my reviews a little more lighthearted and anecdotal but let's skip the foreplay and get down to business.  just the facts.i've been coming to this sports clips for about 3 years now so it's safe to say i like coming here.  i'm always greeted with a friendly smile by the young lady at the front desk.  99% of the time i get my haircut by nora.  nora's very friendly and easy going but don't let her laid back persona fool you.  she cares about her craft and wants to make sure my haircut comes out great and that i am satisfied with the cut.  the other 1% of the time when nora isn't available, i go with a stylist she knows that is working and i am just as happy.if you want to know how the location looks inside, look at any of their commercials.  it's spot on.  tvs everywhere!  in the waiting room.  at each stylist station.  in the bathroom.  ok maybe not the bathroom.  but you get the idea.  they keep the floors and stations clean at all times.  my recommendation is to get the season tickets which gives me 6 mvp experiences (haircut, steamed towel, shampoo, shoulder massage) for the price of 6 varsity cuts (standard haircut).  makes the checkout quick and easy.yelp tip: call in about 15 minutes before you get there to put your name down on the list.  this will save you some wait time if they are busy."
"this place is great!  i have been going here for a few years now and always get a good haircut.  nora has been my go to and she never disappoints!!  they provide a great full service mens haircut.if your looking to get fancy and dye your gray hair or something, this is not that type of place!  great people, haircut, and mvp."
"i have been going to sports clips for the past 8 years and to this particular one for the past 4. as far as sports clips go this is the best i have been to. i like the stylists here a lot (i have tried several and they are all great) and they are very nice to students (even offering a $5 discount with ucsd id). it can be a little pricey and sometimes there can be a bit of a wait (~30 min max usually) but it is worth the time! the mvp haircut is very relaxing and is a nice way to treat yourself after studying hard for a midterm or staying up all week to do homework. overall, i usually walk out very satisfied with my haircut and happy with the service."
great service and consistently good haircut. very happy with the service i've received here. i'm a regular. i really appreciate the way this place is run and managed.  it's top notch.
"i went here for a walk-in appointment and got their mvp option. i was fourth on the list, so at first i was tempted to try again another day, but i figured i had time to wait. turns out it was a pretty short wait! less than 20 minutes. these guys are fast, friendly, and skilled enough to do a quality cut in 30 minutes or less."
"the location is clean and looks like every other spirt clips. staff are friendly enough, but i feel like they rush through the mvp experience. my haircut is always good, though. i've sometimes had to wait a bit to be served: even though they seem to rush through service, they seem to dawdle between clients. that might be a misimpression on my part due to the fact i happened to arrive during a shift change today, but even though there were four stylists present, for a while i was the only person being served while several people were stacking up in the waiting area."
great place for a quick cut and a good styling! i went to this place for 5+ years and without a hitch was happy every time i went and have them show you the cut book.
"worst haircut i've gotten in my life. period. i even showed her a picture of a past haircut that i've gotten that i was going for, or something similar to it. it wasn't even close. when i asked her to fix the side/front, she literally snipped off a chunk of my hair. asked her to fix the back of my hair, whatever she did, it was either unfixable or she doesn't know what it means to 'fix' anything about my hair.went there on saturday february 18th in the evening, didn't even bother to remember her name because i'd hate to put anyone in a spot that'll ruin her career, but i just want her and the management to know that first, she did a really bad job, and second, she was unprofessional. when i say unprofessional, it doesn't mean that she was 'rude', but like she spent more time trying to convince me how good of a job she was doing, rather than really taking the time to understand what i was going for.never going back."
never again - hairdresser was resistant to doing what i wanted. a extra star given for managers attempt of offering a free redo. did not go again though.
"decent wait. great haircut. was able to get a free shampoo, hot towel, and massage since it was my first time."
omg awful!! the lady smelled like cigarettes and was very unprofessional. uneven haircut .. now have to pay someone else to fix it.
not very good. fade was ok but i asked the girl to only take a half an inch off and she completely butchered the top. if you're looking for a fade you're probably ok but if you want a hair cut you might want to look for a professional. completely no bueno~
"went on a wednesday at 10:45 am. wasn't too busy, but still a 5-10 minute wait since there were only two people working. kiki was the one who cut my hair, she was nice and asked me if the way she cut it looked good. and for first time customers i got a free upgrade to the mvp, which included haircut, shampoo, heated towel on the face, and a shoulder massage. overall a pretty good experience, the cut was not bad either. took around 15 minutes total."
"always a wait, but this place offer so many perks it's hard to ignore. free touch-ups is the biggest convenience because i grow neck hair like a grizzly bear. the shampoo and massage is really nice and tvs means i don't miss a game. hope they have the game you want though because all the tvs are tuned to the same channel. they also have high quality products at pretty decent prices if you're low on conditioner or pomade. problem is always the wait and sometimes the stylists can be subpar."
"what can i say about this place other than, my stylist kiki is the only reason i come here. i followed her when she moved to this location, despite it being a considerable distance from my house; she's that good! kiki absolutely makes this place! she's funny, professional, and does an amazing job every time. if you are considering this sport clips, ask for kiki, she is a notch above. this place is fortunate to have someone like her working there... she is the only reason i drive as far as i do to frequent this establishment, and i couldn't be happier with her as my stylist!"
"short version:1) ignore the decor because this place is not just for men!!!2) ask for mary- she is a therapist, a stylist and a hair professor all in one.3) my sisters, you will want to weep openly for the super spa treatment you receive for a pittance compared to what you've been getting at ""salons.""4) despite the bargain basement prices, do not skimp on the tip.long version:i walked in here with my guy to wait for his trim and when i heard that the mvp came w/ hot towel, face and neck massage and massage shampoo for $24 and for $5 more you would get 2 for 1, i was like ""can i get that?""  oh sure, said mary, the helpful patient lady at the front desk.and then i said ""i'm ready to cut it all off."" mary suggested i look up a photo before she went for the clippers. so i found something decent- she looked at it and said- ""ok, you are going all the way. we'll take it slow and see how you like it."" she then spent a good long time giving me a great haircut, tweaking it periodically and adjusting until it was just right. and then i got the double double- two shampoos w/ aromatic product, head rub, and two hot towels applied w/ face massage all while i was in a vibrating massage chair. no, that has never happened to me. it was magical.  then i got the neck and shoulder rubdown w/ a massage machine.not only the treatment, i got schooled while my hair got tamed. did you know you need to train your hair? that applying product to wet or dry hair produces different effects? i picked up a good deal of info on my hair and how to deal with it. yup. i went from long to short with a totally unknown stylist at a mall chain and you know what- it was the best thing that ever happened to me or my hair.  that fancy $100 salon experience with slightly disdainful ""stylists"" (you know who you are) is a thing of the past for me. i'll look past the locker room wallpaper and sports broadcasts- or better yet, i'll close my eyes and let mary work her magic while i relax."
i use to go here often but today was plain awful. i waited for 15 minutes with my name first in line to only get bypassed by two other people with name lower than mine. why they wouldn't take me borders on racism. not recommended
"this was my first visit to any sports clips. i went at 1:00 pm and there was hardly any wait. my stylist's name was loan and she was very friendly. she upgraded me to the mvp haircut without me having to ask. it includes haircut, hot towel, shampoo, and shoulder massage. she made sure i was comfortable and that she was cutting my hair the way i liked."
"**my review reflects the service i have been receiving from one of the hair stylists and has nothing to do with my overall satisfaction with this place. **last time i went there jenny cut my hair. haircut was ok but her trimmer injured my neck and actually it was burning and red when i came home with sign of blood on the napkin i used to disinfect my neck. my poor luck this time ended up with her again and didn't want to be rude and ask for another stylist. and same bad unacceptable attitude and did the same thing to my neck. i simply said "" your trimmer seems to be too sharp and rough on skin"" her reply "" you always complain, next time ask for another stylist"". she was very rude and insulting. i have been going to this place for over five years and will keep going because i like everybody else over there but would never get a haircut with her again!!"
"overpriced for the quality of cut. in terms of technical skills, christina did not seem at all comfortable handling the clippers or scissors. she gave me a 1 on the sides and a 5 up top which is what i asked for, but her inability to blend between the two lengths confirms a lack of training. in terms of professionalism, she came off as defensive when i politely asked her to adjust the shape of my cut. during the attempted adjistment, her fidgety scissor technique managed to pluck a few of my hairs all while explaining to me how 90% of their clients ask for a haircut the correct way. it was at this moment i knew i would not come back. can't speak for the other barbers, but would not risk it regardless."
"i asked for a fohawk. after all the fade and adjustment, the lady shaves off like a tiny bit of the front part of my hair right in the middle right above the forehead. now its growing and it looks like a little hanger dangling off. now its short and stiff, so no hair product could fix this either. its been like this for about 6 months now. never going back here again."
"good haircut, very convenient and price is reasonable for the services provided (higher end men's haircut). christina did an excellent job."
"i was in desperate need of a trim, christina was very helpful and took it slow and made sure to remove my dead ends while keeping the length and style i wanted. she recommended a conditioning leave in spray that she used on me during the cut and i purchased it because it smelled so good and made my hair feel super soft."
"the last two times i've been in have me never wanting to return. it's obviously not a good time to show up at 7 pm. they are all tired and just want to be done. i was barely acknowledged and the kiosk said 10 min. two stylish there both finishing cuts. at 12 min in one finished. she collected fee and then disappeared into the back. then 10 min later she apparently had gone into the back to eat. she was still chewing as she was now cleaning up her station! still did not acknowledge me as i got up to leave. so, i guess i'm back to the la mesa one. puzzles me why none of the stores are managed or zero ownership present. one mvp always on the search of better treatment....."
all i have to say is trina is incredible. professional and one of the best haircuts i ever had the pleasure of getting. do yourself a favor and head on in and ask for trina. your welcome.
"the best haircut i have ever had. the stylist, chris, made me feel like a million bucks. great place. excellent treatment and super stylist. i'm going back, for sure."
"updating my review because it's just not fair to judge a business on a single bad experience. i've had so many other positive visits here, and i will continue to come and visit my regular stylist kori. she is outstanding, and in the future will just wait as long as it takes to get my hair cut by her. thanks to the manager for reaching out to make this right."
didn't get a hair cut for my son after waiting 30 minutes even though he was next merely because we felt uncomfortable taking the girls time. i know we walked in at 7:30p and the girls were exhausted but that's the only time we have to get these chores done after i've worked along day and my kids are finished with sports. the two girls seemed more annoyed and bothered by our business than pleasant to serve us. it was really uncomfortable. we won't be returning
i came in at 3 and didn't leave till 4 when there was only 2 people ahead of me and the service was horrible they took no time to check on their work.
service was quick. i had a regular haircut which was sort of pricey for no shampoo option. i would recommend shopping around
"lost me! you do a decent haircut, but really the damned kiosk that won't let you sign in without email, phone, address?  screw that!  i need a haircut, not more crap in my inbox!"
"my husband loves this place and describes it as such (i can vouch for him):- friendly ladies... great conversationists.- fast... cuts never lasted more than 15 minutes- consistant... good cuts every time- good price... military discount!- no bs... you get your cut and you're donethey also show you that they sterilize everything at your first visit. they have a rewards program for those who get hair cuts all the time as well. my husband bypasses all other barbers to come here for his military cut... he really likes the no hassle... you're in and out. he isn't even a football fan (but i am, i love going with to watch the sports networks.) they have a big screen for the waiting area. works fine with me. sometimes i wish they took longer with his haircut haha.seriously, the best you can get out there for consistent, no hassle, in and out haircuts. 5 stars."
always a fun time going in there. great stylists and make sure i get the style i want
"recently took my 11 year old in for a hair cut. i really like the new way to check in. our wait wasn't to long. in the end, he had a really great, clean cut."
"great haircut and great service. a bit more than i was used to, but worth it. i especially love that they do free neck trim between haircuts. i'm definitely coming back here."
"jessica is awesome!! super-talented, always cheerful, & does a fantastic job for my boys.  she gets pretty busy, but she's worth the wait : )!"
"the experience was amazing for my boys. they are 8&7 but felt like ""men"" as they watched sports and got pampered. trina was so patient and worked around their movement as they could not stay still. she made them feel so comfortable and talked with them as well as made them laugh. :) we will be back and will be recommending this location to all of our friends!"
"i always have a great experience here, and my haircuts come off perfect.  trina is quick with the experience, and you can tell by how she cuts she's an expert.  i've gone elsewhere and the stylists seem lost, and make mistakes.  the amenities here speak for themselves of you're a sports lover.  once a month i visit, never disappointed.  docked one star for the price, but that's life in 'merica, everything up-charged based on what people are willing to pay."
wish i could give no stars. horrible customer service and a mediocre haircut at best. the place looks decent but i didn't go there to watch tv. there are so many other places to go. stay away from this joke of a barbershop.
my 14 year old went today and got a horrible cut.  his stylist must be drunk.  not even close to straight.  i would post a picture if i could.  he is traumatized and has to go to school and be the subject of ridicule.  this could be a life shaping event for a high schooler.
"my sweetheart has been going to the same barber for over 15 years but one day he was near the santee sports clips and decided to give it a try. i don't think he'll be going anywhere else. friendly, personable barbers give great cuts, and the scalp massage is to write home about!"
"i have been coming to santee & poway locations for about a year now. the quality of the hair cuts i have received have been good, the mvp treatments are great, but the length of the massage season seems to be shorter then i remember. could just be me but give 4 stars as experience is good, great."
pam is an incredible stylist who always cuts my hair the perfect length!i always enjoy going to this location as everyone is friendly and super professional!
"it had been over 6 or so years since the last time i tried out a sports clips. i stopped going to this chain because the quality was so inconsistent. unlike supercuts which is guaranteed mediocrity, sports clips is bi-polar. amazing, or terrible.. but i've started to try this place out again. i came in late afternoon (3pm) and the wait was only 5 minutes. the cut was great...i came back a month later and someone else cut my hair..the cut was terrible..- enough with the attitude if you don't put your phone number on the wait list. - enough with blacking out the windows so you can't tell if it's busy or not from the street.- inconsistency, it's a sports clips thing..risk / reward... i think i'll stick with mediocrity with supercuts."
"my son was really pissed-off after his barber lady simply used a ""military style"" too short & zero style clipper cut this past friday afternoon. she didn't deserve her two-dollar tip..."
"anne is hands down the best stylist i've ever had. i recently moved to los angeles and still schedule my haircuts around the times when i visit sd just to get my hair cut with her--no one else really compares. she always greets me with a smile and she knows exactly what to do to make my hair look great. the first time i got my hair cut with her she gave me a play-by-play and asked me questions to make sure she was doing what i wanted. after that first cut, she's never had to ask again because she has my full trust. the other stylists are very friendly as well. the place is usually very clean and the wait times aren't too long. highly recommended!"
"a bit intimidating at first walking into this masculating steroid wonderful customer experience. they are accommodating and try everything to make it right. too bad a handful of people who live in del mar feel privileged and give them a hard time. this place has a good system going on, just pop your name onto a computer and it'll give you a wait time that shows up on a tv screen. come 5 minutes earlier than the expected time and you're ready to go."
"after years of seeing ads for the sport clips franchise in airline magazines whenever i traveled for business, and being fascinated by the concept of a haircut place geared towards guys, i was excited to try them out when sport clips entered the san diego market.  nearly a decade later, i am still a loyal fan.over the years, i've visited nearly every location throughout the county but continued to remain loyal to the location closest to my home until a year or two ago when i could no longer take the deterioration of the brand at that other location.  while that other location certainly had the sport clips look and branding, the ""feel"" and ""vibe"" were gone and, after taking a seat in the chair, you felt like you were sitting in the stereotypical nail salon where all of the workers were talking, gossiping and griping amongst themselves.  i was at my breaking point and even considered returning to my college days of frequenting supercuts.  before going down that path, i decided to hop on yelp and check out the other sport clips locations.  i'm glad i did because that connected me with sport clips del mar and the amazing crew they have there.venturing in that first day and being greeted with their trademark ""welcome to sport clips"" (something the other location had long ago abandoned or forgotten about) put a smile on my face.  i was sold.  although there are two other locations closer to my home, i continue to go out of my way to visit this location every month and they have earned my loyalty visit after visit.in looking at the other reviews, a number of commenters complained about the previous waiting system and them being ""passed over"" for other clients.  the previous system used a clipboard where you would sign in and wait just like every other location.  confusion might arise when someone would sign in, find out there was a 45 minute wait, go next door for a sandwich and return in time to reclaim their place in line.  when that client was called next, the other people waiting in the lobby thought that the client had jumped ahead of them.  that problem no longer exists.recently, this location invested a lot of time, money and training to implement a new tablet based sign in system.  with the new system, you sign in on a tablet, select your preferred stylist, if you have one, and you receive an estimated wait time.  the flatscreen tv on the wall displays where you are in the ""line up,"" how long your wait is and who is next ""on deck.""  while the new system took some getting used to, it is an awesome addition and has seemed to alleviate a lot of the confusion i used to witness sitting in the lobby while i waited.in the real estate business, they talk about location, location, location.  location is great but what matters in the service industry, is service.  despite being one of, if not the most established sport clips location in san diego county, the ownership at the del mar location has not forgotten its roots nor the sport clips brand - they remember the sport clips motto - ""it's good to be a guy!""while any owner can put together a nice, clean and shiny store, what sets this location apart from the others i visited is the staff and the management's dedication to retaining stylists who believe in the brand and the sport clips concept.  although every stylist i have encountered believes in the brand and treats the client like an all-star, one stylist in particular, is the store's mvp - brittney w.  brit's consistency and attention to detail are always spot on and she treats every client, whether they are a first timer or a longstanding client, like they are the most important client there.  brit - keep doing what you're doing... you make the store what it is!"
have been a fan of sports clips for over 8 years. this is an awesome location! kiri is incredible! you won't regret it!!
this is a nice place with friendly people. kiri cut my hair and she did a great job! all the girls there were very nice. i was in n out in no time. thanks!
"this review is for the stylist, not the location. pam is the best... hands down. attention to detail, genuine care and concern and overall great attitude is what keeps me coming back every three weeks. only a matter time until she opens her own studio with the demand she has, so make sure to see her soon! you won't be disappointed."
my barber was unable to take me due to illness for a few months so i was on the search to find a great haircut. luckily i contacted brittney and there was no wait time at all. right off the bat she asked me how i wanted it cut and she was done in less than 20 minutes. great haircut and fantastic personality! see you next month brittney!
"i don't like sports. unless you count combat sports, i suppose.. but on paper i have absolutely no reason to be in this very.. 'macho' oriented place. i don't follow baseball, basketball, football, hockey, etc, etc.  that being said, i am a creature of habit.. and after having a 'falling out' with my previous barber of 7 years (he was refusing to do what i was asking him to), i needed a new hair stylist. on a complete whim whilst in my local shopping mall, i thought to myself 'wouldn't it be hilarious if i ended up getting my hair cut at sportclips?'. so i walked in, and fate introduced me to brittney. she's charming, charismatic, and actually passionate about what she does - the most admirable trait in anyone, which makes the the inner-turmoil i feel whilst being bombarded by sports-related messaging so much easier to manage. everyone else who works here seems nice too, but specifically i cannot recommend brittney enough. even if you're like me and avoid the sports media at all costs, they do a good job of making you feel comfortable here."
"i like this place! i come in about once a month and i usually get clipped up by a lady named kiri. she's friendly and professional and the place is always clean, and cool on those hot days. sometimes too cool, but that's better than too hot when you're sitting in the chair. prices are fair and i've never had a bad cut there, so i'll keep coming back."
"great haircuts, awesome crew products and a super friendly staff. taylor castillo is the best out there!"
"all smiles here. brittney just killed it again with an awesome haircut & mvp! it certainly doesn't hurt that she also works quickly, is an engaging conversationalist, and doesn't get overwhelmed/distracted even when the salon gets incredibly busy. such a positive experience overall."
epic service once again today by britney. she is the only stylist i've seen for the past three years and was actually one of her first customers. mvp is the way to go and make sure to ask for britney!
"diana is not only drop dead gorgeous and pleasant, but a great haircutter to boot. get a shampoo from her. her fingers are magic."
typically i can drop in and be seen in less that 15 min. the cuts are good and the providers are professional.
"unpleasant experience this morning, and nothing to do with the wait time of 45 minutes. stylist started off ok, shaved my sides and back of neck area. then, she asked if she could do something to the two areas on either side at the top of my head, because they look 'elongated' and it made me look like a conehead. being that i'm close to 50 and no longer have the hair of a 20-year old, i shrugged and said i'm kind of used to it at this point, no biggie. stylist went on to say - not once, not even twice - but three times said ""if you don't care about your hair that's your problem, but as your stylist.. "" and went on with some self-prophecizing rant. i had to say ""i didn't say i didn't care"", but didn't want the situation to blow out any further. when it was time to checkout, sportsclips' pinpad offers $5 as the minimum tip - more than 20% - so you have to hit the other button for a different amount, which i did. i still tipped her, of course, but it'll be the last time this location sees my business."
"i've been going to the del mar, ca location for sometime now and very happy with them. professional staff and my stylist ""diana"" always takes the time to make sure hair comes out perfect. always kept clean and just a pleasant visit."
"nice people but i got botched like never before. stick to barber shops, twice the talent for half the price."
"love this place and kay is the best but the whole staff is great too. friendly, reasonable and typically pretty fast."
"i initially came to this location because of its' proximity to my work but what made me a returning customer was their excellent service. throughout my returning visits i have consistently received great haircuts and customer service, specifically by kay and liz.    this location is great if you're looking for knowledgeable and friendly staff, who clearly care about their profession. i always look forward to my next visit!"
visited this location yesterday for the first time. had the pleasure of getting an mvp haircut from liz. definitely recommend her & i'll be going back! the hot towel and scalp treatments are second to none!
kay is awesome and they always take care of me :) i definitely recommend picking up some tea tree product for your hair and getting the mvp. always a nice conversation and professional staff. i highly reccommend this location!
"first time customer here. it was definitely unique to any local barber shop i've ever been to.  if it's your first time you get a complimentary upgrade to the mvp experience.  it's only a few bucks to upgrade for future cuts (definitely always gonna go with the mvp treatment).  once you walk in, you're asked to check in with a tablet at the counter. was immediately greeted by jasmine after i completed my check in. she was very receptive to what i was looking to do with my haircut. she was also pretty experienced and well-versed with cutting asian men's hair. after the fresh cut, she took me to the back to wash my hair and laid a hot towel on my face, while the chair started massaging away.  that was all followed by a long, relaxing scalp massage by jasmine.  overall, got a good haircut and got the vip treatment from sport clips all thanks to jasmine. would definitely recommend jasmine for anyone looking for a sweet, friendly and skilled stylist."
every time i go in and see kay and her staff i am very pleased. good cut every time! thanks ladies for making my head look good lol:)
kay is the absolute best. i like most sport clips but this location is above and beyond. hardly ever a wait and parking is good.
"this place is goodish. for the price i would want a better haircut, but the stylists are really ice, riana was very sweet. i wanted it to look more even, but it always seems a little off.i would recommend forking over the money to see a real stylist."
i came in yesterday for a haircut and riana did an awesome job! she really knows what she's doing. it was cut at the right length on the top and on the sides. she's also the only one that asks to cut my eyebrows! nobody does that!  that's attention to detail!i was very satisfied and will go back again.
great location friendly staff clean clean clean.kids love it with sports on the tv and great communication.
"one and a half years ago, my boyfriend and i were heading to miami and realized our hairs were a mess. we didn't have time to go to a barber shop, so we just headed to this sports clips. ever since, we go here every two weeks to get our hairs cut because every single stylist here does an amazing job. not only that, but they all remember us and we've built relationships with them.we'll never stop coming here because of the right prices, deals, and amazing people. our favorite is erika, shhh!"
"sportclips is a great place for a guy to come relax, take in some sports, and get a great hair cut.     the mvp is the best value and includes a wash and little massage.    i've been a regular customer for years."
"kay g is the best!! just moved to sd and it took me 3 barber shops before i stumbled into sport clips and got my hair cut by kay. needless to say i have officially found my new home. always does a great job, very impressed!!"
"came here to get my sons hair cut- 3years old & 2 years old. the 2 ladies didn't greet them, didn't talk to them, and anyone with kids knows you have to be overly accommodating to get kids to trust you and listen. they did the job, cut their hair. weren't helpful or creative- very dry. and my 2 year olds ""fade"" is anything but a fade. as a business owner, its disappointing to see employees have such a disregard for hospitality and customer service- at the owners expense. i would not return here."
"first time to sport clips in clairemont mesa,kay and her staff were awesome!!! perfect haircut and a teatree shampoo after #spoiled is all i can say cause it was great!!! will defintely be coming back and going to tell my friends and co-workers."
worst haircut ive ever had! dont go here unless you want some terrible hair stylist to f*** up your hair
"went in for a hair cut and beard trim today. i had the please of getting my hair cut by the store manager kay g. super friendly, great conversation during my hair cut. she did a great job! recommend going through this location."
thank you kay! my girlfriend loves my haircut. :)
number 1 rule of getting a haircut is to always stick with the person that knows your hair better. mine has always been kay because she does a great job doing it right.
update. this place is better than ever! the online check-in service is perfect for planning a quick cut during a busy work day. awesome job kay!!
kailani is the very best. very detail oriented and pleasant. friday evenings there is no line. score!!
"after the second time saying, ""no, i said short,"" i finally gave up, went home and trimmed it myself. it's even and straight now too."
"first time was great, my boys were lucky to get tara.  today we walked in and literally were barked at by cait as we entered the door.  i was afraid to have her cut my son's hair after that!  she hardly cut anything off and copped an attitude when i called her out on it.  won't be returning."
"definitely call ahead!  we walked in and had 8 min to go after waiting 30 minutes.  we then were bumped to 30 minutes and now the wait says 50 minutes... not sure how they run their ""line"" but something was not working in our favor. still haven't had the hair cut so hopefully it was worth the wait.  there are a lot of other options out there."
"not the place to go if you have a son with long hair.  we usually go to the sports clips in carlsbad but we were in encinitas so stopped here.  the young lady who cut my son's hair was clearly not happy to be at work that day and was very grumpy.  she tried to wash my son's shoulder length hair and was not even able to get it all wet or pull it out from under his shoulders.  the haircut was a disaster, it was uneven in the front and when i mentioned that and asked that she check it she actually said ""i don't know how to do that""! i was shocked.  i gave up and we just paid for the cut and left.  the uneven bits were really annoying so we took him to the carlsbad sports clips yesterday to have it fixed. the lady there noted the front was very uneven but it was hard to fix it without cutting a lot more off.  she got it pretty good and fixed the rest of his hair.  she was surprised that we got such a bad cut at a sports clips.  i was not happy to have to pay twice for a basic hair cut."
"only my second visit today, but both times i've been impressed with rhia. friendly, makes me feel relaxed, gently upsells but doesn't press me. recent trips to other sportsclips have been unfavorable experiences - and so it's welcomed to feel at ease for even a 20 minute haircut."
they give good haircuts here. the hard stylists are nice. but they're online reservation is a disaster. i've reserved a spot numerous times and when i get there the wait time is significantly longer than indicated or i'm not registered at all. this is only a problem because the place is always busy. so if you go simply walk in you'll very likely end up having to sit and wait 30min or even over an hour. i saw many people walk in while i was waiting experiencing this.
"this sportclips actually yields some pretty strong cuts, assuming you get the right stylist. as with most chain hair cutting places, it's all about the stylist in order to obtain your desired style and the quality of cut. if you'd like a bit of a treat, i'd recommend you upgrade to mvp in order to get a bit of hot towel treatment, shampoo and a shoulder massage along with your cut. pros-mvpgreat location lots of stylists call ahead prior to arriving cons-subjective selection of stylists sometimes inconsistent gets crowded"
"great place for a haircut! friendly staff who will listen and give you exactly what you ask for, and the mvp treatment is the best! also the online check in is a great feature and really cuts down on any potential wait time."
"always call aheaad! the girls over here always do a great job with my hairs on my head. $20 for a cut and the clean ups are free to keep your cut fresh longer. i am a fan, but like i said always call ahead as it will likely save you time and often bumps you ahead of people. rookies!"
"we went last night around 6:30 and the girl in front desk she look at me and the moment she saw i was not american she look at her book wish was empty then her computer and said , im sorry you need to wait 25 min and the place was  empty and not even thank or sorry , nothing she just went and start talking to another girl in there and started moping , this is my first time that i have this experience and i always took my son there , make me and my son very sad and confused about why she treated us like we didn't matter. i just wish the owners really see why their business is going bad :(now we need to find another place to cut our hair"
"always a great cut!friendly staff, not usually much wait time,centrally located. the go-to place for my teenage son."
i needed to get a haircut and once again not enough time in the day. i had my hair cut at this shop about a year prior and wasn't happy with the result at all. i thought i would give em another shot to see if the gal who seemed to be timed by a stopwatch was a fluke. well once again i received the worst haircut since previous visit. for $ 20 you would think someone would give you a top notch detailed cut as well as razor cut your neck and side burns. with the volume of customers you would think these gals would have great skills. not. i'm never going there again i could probably hack my hair better myself!! also it's kind of hard to tell when they put goo in your hair and comb it until you wash your hair and try to do it yourself. horrible uneven scissor cut. my wife asked me what the hell happened to me
"i was working nearby and was in need of a haircut so i stopped in and i'm glad i did!!!for me haircuts are not all that exciting just something that needs to be done, so sports clips was kind of unusual for me because i felt pampere!!so let's get started my haircut was excellent! then it was followed up with my hair being washed and a warm towel for my face !!! it was nice i won't lie !!then it was back of the chair where she dried my hair a little and cleaned up my neck and eyebrows for me but if that wasn't enough i got a little massage with electric massager on my shoulders and neck !!! so now i'm relaxation mode!i am going to have to make a special effort to come back here on a regular basis in between the regular cut cut kick you out the door places !the staff there was very friendly and i look forward to seeing them again!thank you very much for the great cut and experience"
"very friendly and accommodating.  walk in and no wait.  and watch sports, great deal.  quick too."
my son loves this place. he loves the massage and the hot towel and always gets the mvp. this time he worked with cait and she was awesome!
great place to get your hair cut.  nice and professional stylists.  avoid going right before holidays at it gets very busy!
this sport clips is great. very nice women working here. i didn't have to wait long even though it was saturday morning. i needed a nice cut for my baby shower i had and they did a great job.
best hair cut for men in encinitas. where else can u watch sports and get your hair cut?
"this franchise as a whole is genius. it's basically a man cave with cheap haircuts. at first i was kind of embarrassed about getting their ""mvp"" treatment - which includes a shoulder rub at the end. hahaha. but hey, why not right?i like this spot and the concept so i bought their season pass too. let's you get haircuts at a discount by buying 5 in advance or something. it's actually a relaxing experience for guys, imagine that. anyway, i recommend it for boys and men. chicks might dig it too, but they're definitely not sport clips' target market. the hairdressers are very nice, professional and so far i haven't had any mishaps like that time at supercuts when i waked out with an inch of scalp over my ears. yikes that was horrible. they get my deal of approval."
"great haircut. after having long hair for a few years i was hesitant to have somebody new take clippers to my head. elisa cut my hair and knocked it out of the park! gotten a handful of compliments since i got it, will definitely be back."
we come to this location all the way from 4s ranch just to get my 13 year old twin boys' haircut! they love coming here to see polly!  she's really good and knows the popular styles for teenagers!  plus my boys do hip hop and they love the cool haircuts polly recommends and my boys are very picky!
i've submitted a review before for sports clips but not for cynthia! she is awesome! she did such a great job with my haircut and definitely gave the mvp service with my mvp cut. she's cut my hair a few times and has always done an awesome job! thank you cynthia!
"have been coming to get my hair cut here ever since my girl polly started working here!she's the best, very meticulous cutting my hair and i can tell she cares about the end result.very cool to talk to, great hair cut every time, can't say enough about the great experience i get every time here!"
i took my son to get his haircut. his bangs were right above his eyes and the last person i took him to (not sports clips) cut them crooked as well. i mentioned twice that the person who gave him his last haircut cut his bangs crooked too.  i specifically said not to cut that much off his bangs and just to even them up but a picture is worth 1000 words. it wasn't because my son was moving around because he was very cooperative. i would have given 1 star but the back was okay.
"my son loves coming here!they always take the time to ask him what he wants and make sure he is happy with the cut and give styling ideas and tips.great service, and i love that they have him in their system and he can handle this on his own."
"my son and i went in with full on mops on our head. with the summer in full blown 80's-90's at the beaches in san diego i felt it was time to trim it all. tracie took me right away. she was great!!! very pleasant, confident, made me feel very comfortable and trimmed my hair to my exact description."
awesome service! convenient online check ins. pretty stylists who are great what they do. always a welcoming environment as soon as you open the doors. i always come to polly at this location. she's awesome and i went to her at her previous location. great conversationalist! she does a great job with my hair!!!
"pholly is simply incredible. i drive out of my way to go and see her at sports clips. pholly is always friendly, professional and goes above beyond the needs of her customers. she leads with example and makes a great name for sports clips."
"first time there, alix was very helpful and great hairstyles. i'll be recommending people to go back to them - thanks"
polly is the absolute best.  i've been seeing since her mission valley sports clips days and followed her to this location.  great service and good value!
"the idea of listing the way i like my haircut on my file in the computer so i get the perfect haircut every time! the free neck trims anytime! the mvp & season pass! the products for sale which i only need to use a small portion and i get to try after my haircut! the kindness and customer service! i could go on & on. i've been a sports clips fan for years! almost forgot to mention, the new sign in addition with the computer tablet!"
"honestly i'm freaking pissed the hair cut wasn't what we asked for my 7 year old kept complaining about his ear so we check it and she had cut it and there was blood coming out, who the heck are you hiring have some kind of quality control and next time if you cut a kids ear tell the parents, i'm deeply disappointed."
always satisfied with the cut and mvp treatment. thanks! definitely get the whole mvp
almost always have a great haircut here. very nice people. mvp with wash and neck message are excellent.  had one bad haircut but the manager tried to fix it and comped the haircut. plus you can watch sports there. i've been coming here for years and get the mvp package. highly recommended
"i been here a few times when my regular girl is out of town & my haircut is very easy, just get the sides and back shaved..  there was no wait and all the workers were very nice but the girl who did my hair shaved the back of my neck with a razor to get the stuble a lil to hard and now my neck has razor burn & it took several days to heal. needless to say i wont be returning."
i had taken my two year old son to get his hair cut at a different business and he was so scared we left with a lopsided head of hair. i came in worried the same thing may happen. but as soon as veronika started cutting i could tell my son was comfortable with her and distracted. i was so happy with the experience. thank you!
"riana does not know how to cut hair. and quite frankly she had an attitude, from the very beginning when she chuckled at me because she did not know what a ""quiff"" was when i told her that is what i'm aiming for, to not even smiling or saying thank you when i gave her a $4 tip even though she missed a lot of long hairs on the top and in general just did a lazy job with my haircut. i will not be going back here again, which is a shame because the ladies here knew their stuff before they changed management. congrats riana, you win the award for the worst haircut i've ever got in my life. which is a pretty big achievement. work on your people skills girl."
"ive been going to sport clips for 4 years now, three different locations, and all of them provide great service, and a quality cut thats easy to fit in to your schedule. i am a fan favorite of polly, the new manager at this store. she is friendly, professional, and always does a great job. having someone who knows what you want each time you get your hair cut is a huge value to me. i highly recommend this place!"
"quinn is a very good barber!  i got a great haircut, shampoo, and neck rub. they offer a free neck trim in two weeks as well.  lots of tvs with ball games on in an atmosphere resembling a pro locker room."
great haircut at a good price!lori is the best...although try someone else so you don't give me a wait when i come in! ;)
"find a real barber. don't go here. first time going there today (7/18/18) wait was over 30 mins with only a handful of people inside. i asked for a medium fade. showed her were i wanted it with my hand on the side of my head. and....i got a high fade. i couldn't see what she was doing bc they put stickers on the mirrors so you can't really see yourself. she faded the hair into the top of my hair, a medium fade should be blended into the sides of the head. not the top. besides the fact she gave me a high fade, it was a terrible fade. waste or time and money. don't go. find a real barber. now i have to let my hair grow out for at least a month just to have it fixed with my next hair cut, which will never be at any of these chain haircut places again."
"jamie was my hairstylist she didnt waste a second of my time. very considerate and helpful, pretty too. i never rate anything 5 stars.."
"this place was great.  i got the mvp package which included the haircut, shampoo, steam towel, and head and neck massage.  all of this while watching sports on tv.  best of all, the price was great. all of that for 27 dlls.  i recommend hannah, who was very professional, polite, and highly skilled at her craft."
"come to sport clips pretty regularly...  sport theme, tv screens all throughout the store so you wont ever miss that sat college football game or sunday football.. maybe you are there on a monday! games games games!staff is pretty friendly,.... and their system has gone digital now you can check the wait times online for a specific stylist or just the wait in general, it is pretty easy set-up, it took me around 30 secs. give them your email, cell, verification and you are set.note: you will still to put in your info when you get to the store, just basically to say that you are there... you have around 30 mins. from when you go through the online process to get to the store before you are booted.prices vary depending on what you are getting anywhere from $5 to $30, i will also say get their stamp card! so you can get a half off on your 5th or 6th cut.parking can be hit and miss, sundays tend to be busy, but i have yet to wait longer that 30 mins to get a cut. thanks for going digital!!!"
got a nice hair cut there but it's definitely not a barber . they also don't do line ups really well.
my son an i went in today to get our haircut. good customer service but both of our haircuts are jacked up. my son's haircut is worse than mine i wanted to shave it bald when i got home. i wouldn't even take a homeless person here to get a free haircut that's how bad it is. never going back!!!
"sports clips is a fine substitute for supercuts. prices are very reasonable, haircut can be very good to bad. pluses:friendly staff. not too talkative which is what i prefer.decent stylists. i've had 3 very good stylists at this location and one really, really bad one. i haven't seen her since which is a good sign. avoid the 20 year old something looking girls. go for someone older and more experienced.good prices. $22 for a regular cut, $27 for the works. also, every time you try a new sport clips location you're upgraded to mvp haircut for free.they store your specific style in their system. regardless of who you have, notes of what the previous stylist executed is saved on a store to store basis. minus that one time i got the terrible girl who finished my cut in 5 minutes and my hair looked like skrillix.bad:monumental wait times. it is absolutely terrible. i've been an hour before closing, at 1pm on a tuesday, almost every time there is a ridiculous wait time. easily 30-45 minutes. if you go in when there's less than a 15 minute wait drive to vegas after, you'll have luck on your side."
this place closed early on a tuesday but i can still see staff inside horsing around at 5pm wtf!!? drove to another location in clairemount mesa and got better treatment instead of being told to leave
"got a good cut for 22 bucks. if you like sports, then you won't miss a game here. interesting place."
"when i don't feel like spending $50+ at a real barber, this is my spot. sometimes the wait can be long, but they do a decent job for a decent price."
been going here for about 3 years now. they recently upgraded their system so you can see how long the wait time will be. the staff has been super friendly every time i go.
lori was very helpful and listened to exactly what i wanted and did a great job. i will for sure be going back to see her.
awesome service! convenient online check ins. pretty stylists who are great at what they do. always a welcoming environment as soon as you open the doors. i always come to see melissia when i come to this location! (this is my main location) she's the best!!! highly recommend her!!! great conversationalist! she does a great job with my hair!!!
"amazing place to get a haircut! everyone is super nice and friendly, definitely coming back again. (:"
"i was sad when my barber of 20 years retired.  i tried a couple of places and then found trish at sport clips.  excellent cuts, nice person, good conversation or quiet when needed, and vip massages are outstanding.   she's a find.  usually a wait for her but she's worth it. this sports clip location is well kept & clean, a tv with sports while you wait, and an overall great environment.  customer service is excellent."
"i always receive great service and a great haircut from all the staff. the stylists are all friendly and professional. i especially like joanna because she is very down to earth,  we always have great conversations and i always get a great haircut from her."
"my husband had his hair butchered here back in december and they gave him several coupons to come back for free haircuts (at this location only). i happened to be with him on this particular visit and i did not appreciate the poor customer service we received. first of all yelp says they close at 5pm on sunday so we scheduled our plans around that. we got there at 4:45pm to find out they were open until 6 (annoying but at least they were still open). it was packed, only two seats open on the waiting area, so my husband went inside to put his name on the list and we were waiting outside until some seats opened up. my husband wanted to go to starbucks because it appeared to be a long wait, but he went inside to ask how long so we could make it back in time. he stood at the counter and lori came up to the counter and rudely said ""do you have a question?!""  he asked how long she thought the wait would be and she rudely replied ""25 min, is that ok with you?!"" he said sure and we went to starbucks while we waited. this place already left a bad taste in our mouths after butchering his hair, and they just put the final nail in that coffin today. this was his last free haircut that could only be used at this location, so we are much happier going to the one closer to our house were they are actually nice to us and appreciate our business. i don't care if you're having a bad day or whatever, you have no right to give someone an attitude when they are being nice to you."
"get the mvp but ask for joanna,her hands are like little miracles massaging your head. with the steam towel and the shampoo,you leave feeling fresh. i have always had good experiences here."
"clean store, friendly and skilled staff. hair cut always looks great. started getting a double mvp for 5 bucks more and it is just what i need to get me through my day. tue-thur seem to be better as far as not being as busy, but they do a great job of getting you in and out of there pretty fast.  thanks ladies!"
"tired of stylists rushing through your cut? not listening to anything you said? putting their own ""touch"" on your cut? go see amy h. and never worry about this again - she will take her time, ask you plenty of questions before cutting and make sure you're happy with the result."
our stylist was very attentive to please both my sons and mine concerns wants and needs. we came in on a sunday and there was no wait. the atmosphere was welcoming and clean.we both left very happy with his haircut and he always gets pampered with the mvp massage and steam towel.our stylist was jan. she took her time and did not rush.  the thing i hate more is paying for a rushed haircut.  i appreciate that she took her time and did an awesome haircut!  thanks
"quick service and watched some games during it, the lady who helped me was very nicegot starbucks while waiting"
"excellent haircut from amy, the new store manager. listened to what i wanted and did a great job making sure it was done right. highly recommend her as your stylist"
"my 2 teen sons live this place.  i love that you can schedule online.  love having trader joe's, restaurants and starbucks.  mom has to multitask!"
amy did an amazing job. she took her time and the attention to detail was just what i wanted. thank you!!
walked in to a store that was clean cool and all the staff where very friendly.. sat down with amy h to get a hair cut and received 5 star treatment and a excellent hair cut.. deffinatly going back again and i recommend this place to everyone...
just had a great experience here thanks to the manager amy. came in for a haircut first time ever & unfortunately either i wasn't making sense or the stylist who originally started cutting my hair was confused about what i wanted but amy noticed things were about to be a train wreck once we got started. thankfullllllly she stopped the hair cut & had me move over to her station where she turned what would've been a disasterous hair cut to one of the best of my life. thank you sports clips & thank you amy! i will definitely be back! satisfied & very happy !
"nice experience. the shoulder massage is a farce, thus 4 stars. everything else is good in the mvp service."
"if you want a fresh cut, go here!  my husband and two little boys visited this place for the first time and loved it!  the appt set up is super easy and we loved all of the tv's with sports games.  amy was our stylist and she was great.  we will become regulars!"
"i stopped in to get a haircut a few weeks ago on father's day weekedn and left very happy. juiliana, did a great job. she was very sweet. she even mentioned that she could trim my beard.  i agreed.  i walked out looking great and feeling awesome. thanks a lot, juiliana."
the manager i believe her name was jill was amazing!she cut both my sons hair and they were very happy with the service. teenage boys these days never know what they want but she listened to them and helped figure out exactly what style they wanted! she made them feel comfortable and i didn't feel like she was just trying to sell me stuff she explained what and why we needed things for our hair. couldn't be happier! loyal customer!
"jill the manager did a great job. she heard me and gave me the haircut i wanted, this is called great customer service.sorry gentlemen, no shaving of the beard. otherwise, great place for a guy to get a cut-style-hair wash."
conviniently located near my place. has sports playing while i wait and staff is nice. relaxing experience getting the triple play service.
well maintained and amazing service. the mvp is completely worth it. afternoon time is the best time to visit since there isn't much crowd!
"horrible customer service.  nobody greets you when you walk in.  you enter your name in a computer, and it goes on an electronic board that is supposed to tell you an approximate wait time.  all employees at this location were too lazy to update the board, so the wait time was blank next to everybody's name.  they also didn't serve people people in the order they arrived.  they just arbitrarily called names from the board.  after waiting 30 minutes with only one person in front of me when i arrived, i decided to leave.  so, i can't comment on the quality of cuts they provide.  however, if their attention to detail on something as simple as managing the lobby is that deplorable, i can imagine their hair cuts are average at best."
i've been going to this place for years now and have never been disappointed. jill is easily the best and most consistent barber. ask for her when you go.
"i recently decided to visit this sport clips location to get a haircut. i usually go to another shop to get my haircut, but my normal person was out of town and i had an upcoming business trip. this was my first time visiting a sport clips location. i did not have an appointment and signed up at the front as a walk-in. within a couple of minutes i was warmly greeted by julie. i explained that i was going on a business trip soon and that i normally go elsewhere to get my haircut. i'm always nervous letting a new person cutting my hair, but julie made me feel right at ease. she quickly assessed how i normally had my haircut and we discussed how she would be cutting it. she made some recommendations and adjusted the fade as well to make it look better.in the end i was pleasantly surprised by how much more i liked my haircut than the one i get at my normal place. i received a number of compliments on it and i plan to go see julie again next time i am in need!"
they spent a lot of time to make my haircut look great! was in and out in less than 45 minutes!
short wait. excellent haircut.  knowledgable and helpful stylists.  thumbs up to sport clips @ cherry orchard shopping center in s'vale.
"great spot, amy is awesome. takes her time and makes sure you're happy with the cut. also for the uninitiated, the credit card machine workflow is as follows:- insert card- remove card after error- press ""swipe""- swipe card- pin- done -"
"i had some business at fed ex office next door, and stopped here on a whim.  i simply wanted a neck trim and light cleanup on the edges.  i was fortunate to meet norma.  norma is exceptional.  we discussed what i wanted, my experiences with other barbers, etc.  once she understood, she did gave me what i wanted.  it was obvious she is a professional in her handling of the clippers.  she has a light touch and an eye for detail.  she's also a fine, interesting person, whose energy and personality i found very stimulating.  i just simply got the neck trim, nothing more, and felt i had met a good friend.  i was so impressed with her that i brought my son in the next day.my son is very particular about where he gets his haircut, and wasn't pleased with the cuts he's been getting here throughout the bay area.  norma took care of him, giving him an excellent cut, one that he was very pleased with.  she's very knowledgeable about the different styles, what might work best, and she took the time to understand what he wanted.  he said he'd get his cuts from her from now on.can't say enough about norma, but i give this place five stars."
"you know when it is a perfect match, when you get the best blend of courtesy, professionalism and talent. just got the best haircut i've ever had. i've  had some great hair stylists over the years but i never felt compelled to write a review until now. extremely courteous staff and talented hairstylists. the mvp experience is top notch( i almost dozed off during the neck massage and shampoo), very relaxing. i see now why this place has all 5 start reviews , truly deserves it. i'll say , if you truly care about your hair and a sucker for good service, you are in for a treat. keep it up guys"
"disappointed yet again- this is the second time you guys messed up on my son's hair. specific directions were given to not touch his bangs or his sideburns, but yet again, sideburns shaved off and bangs cut short!  i'm not sure where the misunderstanding is?  seems like pretty straightforward and easy directions.  because i was not there in the salon with my son, i did not get to voice my disappointment in person or be a helicopter parent to monitor the hairstylist's every move. what's especially annoying is that my son now has to take school pictures looking like this. its too bad- i really wanted to like this place and my kids really liked the experience of coming here but having hairstylists that don't listen to simple directions is just not worth it- we won't be back."
"this was my first time at a sport clips, and i must say it was great! better service than any other salon i've been to. in fact it rebuffed me of the salon experience i had on a cruise ship!the staff is friendly and professional, and the owner is great!"
this is one of the best haircut places i have been to. we were visiting bay area from seattle and my two little boys needed urgent haircut. this was closest to our hotel so we stopped by and my kids had a lot of fun in addition to very smart haircut. they both got chance to chat about ca versus seattle weather and many other things with the employees there. such an amazing and friendly environment this store has. i would definitely go back there with my kids during my next visit. :)
i was in town for work and didn't have time before i left my home in nyc to get a haircut.  this location was close by and had great reviews.  i'm glad i dropped by.  the cut was even better then my regular barber and service was second to none.  i would highly recommend this location to everyone and will be sure to visit again on my next trip in the future.
"i came here for the first time last week for a haircut. nice environment, courteous staff and a great haircut. this is likely the place i'll go to for haircuts from now on. thank you!"
"so just to start off, sport clips is amazing! i have gone to many places to get my hair cut like haircuts 2000, supercuts etc... and it is the same old thing every time poor service with poorly trained hair stylist just out of school... not to say that is true with every stylist that i came across there were a couple that were good and experienced but for the most part you got what you paid for. the first time i walked into sport clips i was really impressed with the decor and the way everything was laid out somebody definitely thought about how to have a hair salon for men with a amazing sports theme, flat screen tvs everywhere, sports memorabilia on the walls, cool seats while you wait and even a really cool tablet for when you check in to enter your information on! to top it off they have a refrigerator in the front while you wait and you can grab a water a sparkling water or even my favorite a kern's nectar fruit drink! i asked the owner to stock extra for me for when i come in and i was happy to see that a whole shelf was stocked the next time i came in! this is the kind of attention to detail that the owners have. being a business owner myself i am very impressed. i continue to frequent sports clips regularly for haircuts and weekly for their mvp if you don't know what that is go check it out is is worth every penny! you get a shampoo, hot towel on your face and massage it is amazing! i can't say enough good things about this place! go check it out!"
"this was my first experience at sport clips and i have to say i was extremely impressed! amy was amazing! she really took the time and listened to my issues i have had at other salons and also the issues i have with my hair. she offered some great products for me to use on my hair which they had in the salon and were 20% off! great deal! i also took advantage of the mvp treatment and it was amazing! i almost fall asleep, it was so relaxing! i don't live in san jose just visiting family but i will tell you that every time i come now to visit i will be stopping by to see amy!"
love it. great cut. affordable price. they even massage your shoulder and head while putting a hot towel on your face while washing hair after cut. highly recommended.
"i really wish you could give 0 stars. this was our 2nd try at this place, only because of how nice the stylist was the first time around. haircut was just ok, but i wanted to give it another try before abandoning the place. wow, what a mistake that was, my poor son came home looking like he needed a haircut more than ever. it was just awful. the woman couldn't comprehend what my husband was trying to tell her and gave up hoping she knew what she was doing. unfortunately, we are left trying to figure out how someone can be employed cutting hair, yet clearly cannot cut hair. do yourself a favor and save your hair, go somewhere else."
this is a great place for a mens haircut. the owner and staff are very kind. i took my african american son here and he was very happy with his haircut. i appreciated not having to smell hairspray or nail toxins while i waited. we will go back.
"was such a great experience.  i just had my hair mutilated at another hair salon that literally should have just been shaved off. i walked into sport clips never expected the treatment i received.  i had my hair cut repaired, got a rinse in a messaging chair with a steam towel and and neck message. i had a relaxing great experience with this place when i thought i couldn't have a worse day. to top it all off at a great price too. disappointed i'm from out of town, i would definitely make this my regular spot if i was local."
"the staff opened at ten am on the dot and the two hair stylists were incredibly nice and attentive with me and with my 18 month old son. they were nice, on time, caring, and extremely attentive. i will definitely be back for a haircut for me and my son. i always get a number five on top and a number three on the sides. my son got a cut with scissors and came out looking totally dapper! this was a great experience for baby's second haircut and daddy's umpteenth haircut."
"i'm really curious as to why this place as 5 stars?!? maybe we just had a bad experience! fiancé went to get his hair cut and he looked exactly the same when he came out as he went in? the person didn't understand was numbers he wanted and barely cut anything, he even requested more off but they didn't know how and called the manager over to make sure it was right. only cool thing was the hot towel since he was a first time guest but not our favorite place."
"to make a long story short: replace the barbers who are terrible please. i normally don't write reviews on yelp but this haircut was so disgusting i just couldn't not write one. i'm going around san jose trying out different barbers so it was my first time here. the barber i had seemed to have little experience cutting mens hair. my taper fade was so off it wasn't even close to a fade?? (they just cut the sides right off) she also cut like double the length of my hair that i asked and the front of my hair was so uneven. you get a special treatment if it's your first time here which i guess is nice of them. but seriously, replace some of the barbers in your shop cause they are really bad. ruined my day :("
"i'm not sure why anyone would give this place five stars. both stylists were rude, and didn't seem to know how to handle the front desk, let alone givemy sons decent haircuts.the younger one, who was obnoxious, was surprisingly the better stylist. my son's cut, though, was okay, not great.the older one gave my other son a buzz cut, which i didn't want. she kept asking me what number i wanted the razor on, and i told her i would prefer she use scissors instead. the result was an ugly, awkward style that even gel won't fix.we won't be returning."
"if you can't find a barber in town, sports clip is a great place to get a haircut.  you can get a mens haircut, shampoo, and chair massage for a decent price.  there are monitors with basketball or football games to watch while you are getting your haircut.  i always leave happy with the haircuts i get here."
"great, quality haircut and an awesome deal with the massage and face rub thrown in! came here because i needed a quick touch up before my wedding. the haircut came out perfect, and since it was my first time, they gave me a free massage and shampoo/head and face massage!i felt refreshed and ready for the day! definitely going back and have been telling all of my friends!"
"love the mvp package, great service, clean place, water cooler, several tv's tuned to sports, and ghinet is the best! check-in online during peak hours, other times little to no wait.ghinet is very detailed, thorough, and consistent. after several other hairstylists elsewhere, she's about the only one that cuts my hair the way i like it and repeats it ""just like last time"" lol. apparently this is hard for some. she is also very nice, respectful, and social, but won't talk your ear off if you're not engaging her. as always, thanks ghinet and see ya soon!"
"fine haircuts but the magazine selection is totally off here. martha stewart living, better homes and garden, and stars--not a single car magazine. i guess they're for mothers who take their kids here but throw me a fricking dog bone!"
just moved into the area and got my first hair cut done from evette who was very nice and took time to cut my hair. got the mvp package which was great. i was very pleased with the overall experience and would recommend it to anyone looking to have a haircut done.
"i so happy to do hair cut in sports clips , because today i did hair cut i really like to be here and also he gave me compliment for steam and relax because they're running promotion anyway thank you"
"i have been constantly going to this specific sports clips and choosing evette to always cut my hair! she's always warm and welcoming and she makes sure she takes her time when she cuts my hair. a few months ago she recommended that i should purchase the nioxin shampoo for fine hair! ever since then my hair has been stronger, more healthy and has been regrowing at a great rate. if any of you guys end up coming here make sure you pick evette as your stylist!"
the wait at this place is honestly unbearable . i only took my two little boys here because of the sports theme but the prices are a little on the high side for kids haircuts and one of the ladies that cut my sons hair(jeanette) gave my son a really crappy haircut-uneven. don't waste your time and money here. plenty of other places.
theresa is amazing! she's extremely thorough and pays attention to detail. i am so relieved to have finally found a great barber that i can trust. thank you theresa!
"this is a review of yanet with sports clips. i used to get my hair cut from a stylist friend, but he moved a few years ago and i began coming to yanet. she does a terrific job and i highly recommend her to you.note: to the reviewers that think they were past up while waiting. sorry, but we put our names on the list before you and then leave the shop. we return later for our haircut appointments. to eliminate any confusion, sports clips has installed a new computerized system with a tv screen on the wall with the waiting list of the customers name and their approximate wait time."
this is the absolute worst place to get a hair cut. the ladies working there have no clue what in the world they are doing. the asian lady that jacked my hair up barely spoke english and shaved off half of the hair on one side of my head. i even showed her a picture and she still had zero clue what to do. never going here again
horrible horrible horrible. worst haircut ever. she just cut away without giving any time to actually give a decent haircut. all of them can't cut. no wonder they've been trying to hire new stylists for at least two months now.
"waiting is too long, haircut was average, and they really push you to buy hair products or upgrade to their higher priced services. customer service is below average. person cutting my hair was rude"
"this is my first time to this sport clips location, i have been to some in the past and they always do a great job. every time i get my hair cut i get the mvp and i never regret it because how can you not like a hair cut with a shampoo, hot towel on your face and a massage, plus you can not beat the tvs they have on with football."
i took my 11 year old son here for haircut. the lady really rushed through his haircut because she had someone waiting for her. my son was a little bit fidgety and i could see her getting frustrated and raising her voice at him. the haircut she gave him was decent. however i paid full price and even tipped her and my son didn't receive all the services that i paid for. i now find out that part of the service that is included in the haircut includes a shampoo and a hot towel which my son did not receive. i understand that she had someone waiting but we also our customers and we are paying as well. i will not be recommending other people to be coming here and most likely will not come here myself. each customer should be treated respectfully and receive the services they pay for
"first of all please update your cover photo. i don't think any of those girls work there anymore. number two please get rid of the online booking ahead. not fair to somebody waiting in the parking lot for you to open where i was first in the parking lot and then someone else pulls in after me like us to sit down first. other than that yanet, is awesome and i will continue to be going there as long as she is there."
"very friendly staff! my son loves the mvp hair cut, includes steamed towel, massage shampoo, neck & shoulder massage for $23 ($27 for adult). lucky kid! slow in here right now! no wait!"
"sport clips is my new go to place for a nice clean hair cut. i highly recommend the mvp package. it is well worth the money. i had the pleasure of having yanet cut my hair the first time. she cut my hair so well that when i went back for the second time. i requested her to cut my hair. she does a job and know how to cut hair well. she is very good at blending in my fade from a ""0"" to ""1"" nicely, she makes me feel comfortable every time. she is very detail oriented and i like that she remembered me from the first time. thank you yanet, i will definitely be coming back for my next cut. mvp deal is the best by far."
i took my 10 year old son for a haircut. he wanted to try a new haircut and get a cristiano ronaldo type of style. yanet was great! this is the best haircut my son has had! i highly recommend yenet! the atmosphere is good and we enjoyed watching the game while we waited
worst place to come for haircut . if you like a quick rushed haircut where they just want to get to the next customer this place is for you . the lady tried to tell me what i want which is never good because you only saw me one time i know what i want and what i usually get i dont need them to do what they feel like doing . she literally spent 5 minutes on my hair and only used the buzzer i wanted a scissor cut  . i would never come back to this place who disguises their bad hair stylist for dumb gimmics like massages ... people come to get a haircut if the stylist were as good as their gimmics this would be a go to spot . spend some extra money and go to a real stylist .
"i ve been coming to sport clips in blossom hill for over a year, and i have to say that i really like this place.  i especially like yanet.  she is very professional and courteous and does an exceptional job.  she understands and helps achieve the style you want.  my teenage sons are really picky, and they will (now) only wait for yanet to cut their hair. i'm amazed at how she can multi task, as a manager and a stylist, and deliver a great customer experience. i highly recommend yanet!  ps you can't go wrong with the mvp package either!"
besides the wait a fairly good place. probably only the second place i've gone to( out of 7) that actually can cut my hair to the specifications i state while making it nice. the star taken off was only due to price(22$ for haircut... so w/ tips probably 26-27) as well as the wait.
"i went on a saturday and waited maybe 10 minutes.  i had never been to the ashland and  wellington location, but had avoided supercuts for several years after a bad experience at a different location.  i took a shot at this one and received the best haircut i can remember.  even my fiance commented how nice it was.  piedad (pili) did a wonderful job, took her time and was attentive to the details.  i'm usually not that picky about my haircuts, so i typically just walk in and take the ealier available stylist.  i will be making appointments with piedad (pili) for my haircuts from now on."
lorie is one of the best stylists around. i am surprised that she is not at a top salon. she has absolutely given me the best haircuts always!
"the salon is nice and clean, and that's about it. my hair cut was nothing like i explained, nothing like the stylist said she will do, and last but not least nothing like the picture i showed her. i went for a haircut, the lady seemed nice, but... i showed her a picture of how i wanted my haircut to look, tho she made a remark that she didint like long hair on me, i thought it wasn't any of her business. well, she cut away my hair  and to my surprise it was so short!  i only went for a ""trim""and shapeup not an entire haircut. the haircut she gave me was the one she wanted not the one i asked for! looks nothing like the picture i showed her. i would not recommend this place, because you should get the haircut you ask for and not the one the person cutting hair wants. too bad i can't give them zero stars.  never going back."
"although fairly early till a wait time, for minimal cut bang trim, check-in app not working properly disappointed very much so."
"delois is a superstar! i originally went to an aveda salon to get my hair trimmed. i left with choppy, uneven facial layers!? i ran to super cuts around the corner and told delois my story. not only did she sit me down then & there. she fixed the horrible mess that someone else created. i know it's hard to fix a bad cut.. but she did :)very friendly staff. will continue to go here from now on!"
i have been going here for about a year . i have used a couple different  people .none bad . pele is the best !!!!! i call in advance to make sure she is available .
i went there last week. i hate it. she doesn't know how to cut hair and i paid $40 bad haircut ever !!!! not recommend!'
"i should have known better than to think that a $15 haircut was going to make me look like i got a $75 one.... lesson learned!  i came here on a random sunday and there was no one in the store... that should have been red flag number one considering it sits in the middle of a strip mall.  but i ignored this and talked to the lady at the front counter, she was young and seemed to know what she was talking about.  i asked for a trim because i like the length of my hair and so she started cutting.  i told her my hair was straightened but that i'm naturally curly, she said she needed to cut my hair while it was straight because it would be harder to get the cut i want if she cut it after she shampooed my hair... (flag #2 -- wth was she talking about, 'cut i wanted'  it was a trim!)  yes i have a few layers in my hair but its not that complicated to the ladies at regis, they always cut my hair after shampoo with no trouble at all and it looks great!  so onto the cut, which was a lot of fluffing up my hair and snip, and fluff and snip, and fluff and snip, etc.  at the end of ten minutes she was done... i looked at it and saw that it looked exactly the same as it did when i came in... and not any shorter, i seriously didn't see a difference.  i asked her if she could cut it more, give me more layers and... fluff and snip, fluff and snip... and voila, same sh**.  so basically, i left the store with the same cut i had, not any shorter and i examined my ends... and guess what, i still had split ends!  a good sylist would have told me she needed to cut down x amount of hair to remove the split ends and would have had noticeable layers.  my hair looks dull, long and out of shape.  never again!"
"went in for a haircut, and when i got home, noticed that it was quite a bit shorter on one side than the other. went back to get it fixed by a different stylist, and she also cut it unevenly. then, when i pointed out that one side was still longer than the other, she agreed, but seemed quite confused that i would want my hair to be the same length on both sides. never going back."
"i am only giving it one stars because the place was clean and the girls where nice, but everything else was horrible. this was my second time here once i sat on the chair the l stylist complained about how long and heavy my hair was. i asked her no not cut too much off the length and she didn't. she kept on complaining on how bad it was cut when little did she know she was the last one that cut it. i decided not to tell her anything because it could have just been that my hair grew out weird. after she finished the back she was supposed to cut the from layers and she had a fit saying that i had no layers and who ever cut it last just cut it in two lengths. she chopped at random pieces of my hair and when she noticed it was getting full she was like okay all done have a great day. i don't like so cute my hair for this reason. my hair ! when i put all of my hair in the front of my shoulders the front is longer. i will never come back here again and i am definitely not going to recommend it to no one. i am so upset of how my hair ended"
brought my son in for an 11.95 haircut and walked out a happy camper. we were in and out quickly and the lady who did his hair was a sweety pie. no complaints here.
"first, i want to preface by saying i understand it's a matter of who, and not where, you get your hair cut, but i just got one of the worst cuts i've had in years at supercuts.  i'm actually really laid back about my hair, but i have a few things i know i like.  i just went in for a trim, and although i explained exactly what i wanted a few times, the woman clearly didn't listen, as i watched her do exactly what i'd asked her not to.  at one point, she actually grabbed one section of hair + held it for a while, scissors hovering, saying ""hmm...how am i gonna go at this?"" while i looked on in horror.  in the end, i came out with a chop job that looks like 3 different cuts rolled into one....and all i wanted was a trim.i would say that if you do go here, make sure you know who you're getting as a stylist.  i think i'll have to find a new place to go tomorrow to get this mess fixed, now."
i've been to the various discount hair salons in lake view and lincoln park and i feel that this one by far is the best. the location is clean and i feel the staff is courteous efficient and do a very good job. i have 2 regular persons who cut my hair here and they always do an excellent job. i'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this location.
"people buy from people, not from businesses. that is the reason i go to this super cuts about every three weeks to get a trim. there is a very talented hair guy there named lauro who told me the first time i visited, "" ....i make you look sexy, ok?"", and he does consistently every time. i had been going to a few salons downtown and just thought one day, ""why am i paying $60-$80 for a hair cut when i wear my hair so short."" i'm literally in the chair for 10 minutes tops. my hair always looks the same and i never get the free beer or champagne i see all the girls drinking when they are doing a dye job or something.this super cuts is located in a big shopping center, neighbors to pier 1 and jewel. parking is easy and readily available. it's just like another super cuts in the city and you sometimes have to wait for a chair. no use making an appointment as it has never made a difference in my wait time. i'm not a big fan of the super cuts coprorate policy that they should not keep the customer in the chair for too long. where this may maximize profitability for the franchise, the customers end up having the same haircut and does not allow the hair dresser artistic freedom. i once asked an employee at another locating why this was. they told me that much like the pizza hut guy is taught how to make pizza that are consistant every time, the ""hair cut school"" teaches you one or two ways to cut hair. this way quality can be controlled and maintained corporate wide. the first thing asked as you sit in the chair and they drape the big plastic apron over you is ""what number"". this means what number would you like your hair cut today. if you are a super cuts customer you will know what i mean.lauro is cool and will take his time, really pay attention to how you request your hair cut, and actually make you look your best. tell lauro i sent you."
this place cracks me up.  why do i keep going there?  i have no idea.  every time my hubby and i go get a hair cut we get someone else who doesn't speak english.  you neame it and they speak it.  my hubby wanted a faux hawk and got a mohawk lol.  then i wanted a graduated bob and now i have a 8 year old girl bob.  the whole time the girl was cutting my hair she kept telling me how hot my husband was (after she asked if he was my son i might add) which i felt very uncomfortable about.  we are only 7 years apart and i am not that old!  i need to find a new place.
"i stopped into this supercuts for a quick eyebrow waxing. the place my friend recommended (paris nails...right across the street from me) was closed...and my brows needed help! these places are always risky, but i was willing to give it a try. i stuck out like a sore thumb being the only female waiting for service. well, the risk paid off-the woman did a great job on my brows. she didn't over wax and she was quick. plus it only cost $8. can't beat that!"
"i could not believe the service i received today.  aprile, my stylist, asked me what i wanted.  i asked for a 3 on the sides and the back, and to have it blended in as i wanted to keep the length on top.  she proceeded to give me a 3 on the sides and the back, but when i excepted her to begin to blend it in, she began cutting a large amount of hair off the top.  i asked her if she could not cut so much off and then she looked at me blankly.  she said it would look weird if the top was longer.  i explained that with my coarse hair, if the top was cut too short, it would stand straight up.  she then continued to work and by the end of it, i just wanted to leave and assess the damage myself.  when i came home and rinsed my hair, i noticed that the top of my hair was clearly uneven.  there was a noticeable slant in my hair.  i am appalled.  this looks terrible.  and the thing is, this is my third attempt with aprile.  the other two occasions, i asked for similar hairstyles with explicit instructions, and she proceeds to give me a 13 year old boy's summer hair cut.  i gave her three chances and she struck out.  i am extremely upset and embarrassed at the result of my visit today.  it is like she's never cut hair before or knows how to follow instructions.  i tried very hard not to give her any attitude, but i was very frustrated and cannot believe that i paid full price plus tip only to sit at home and attempt to fix my hair."
"i have gone to ""cheap"" salons before with no problems most my life. i just created a yelp account just so i may warn people against this place and a women named delouse. i just got the worst f-ing hair cut of my life. first off i am use to more back and fourth before the scissors start clipping. i had to say long layers four times and she never asked how much i want off. i had to stop here after her first cut to show her. at that point its now to late. i asked for a simple layer and a swoop across my bangs. after that she started cutting again going on and on about how i have to keep my hair healthy and saying my hair was thin and dry that's why it was tangling in her comb. my hair is not thin or dry. she was snatching me bald is what she was doing. i was raised by a single father i am not tender headed. now its time for my bangs she sprayed me in the face with water twice like i was a cat on the drapes. she did one big snip and i was done. i have no layers she only cut out the center of my pre-existing bang leaving out the sides of them. i can see the scissor marks in my hair like i had cut it myself. so now not only do i have a poor excuse for a hair cut but i look like i am a kindergarten er that got bored and went at my hair with blue safety scissors. you may ask why i did not stop her or why i didn't ask to have it fixed. i didn't because i don't think any of the women in that place could have done better. my sister and a friend was there with me. they received disappointing hair cuts as well. my sister who is much boss yer then me was correcting the girl who was cutting her hair like it was training. save your self some time and money drive a few more blocks and find another cheap quick place to get your hair cut. once again i have never had a problem with ""cheap"" salons but this one is god awful and i really do hope it goes out of business."
"wow, that's interesting. it certainly never applied to the supercuts at lincoln & peterson, where i first encountered my now-regular hairdresser.  i know that franchise businesses have to maintain a certain ""uniformity of product"" but i was never asked to name a ""number""from a list of standard haircuts. on the contrary, my beautician studied my face and head structure and cut my hair so as to be the most flattering, just like an ""upscale"" hairdresser.  maybe the pressure to conform to a corporate image drove her (and some other good ones i used to encounter at s.c.) to finally open up her own place."
"i got a surprisingly awesome trim here -- on a sunday when no one else was open.  they did an awesome job for $13.  i'll definatly come back.  i'm such a hair snob too, so finally -- something cheap and they did great work.  i wouldn't ask them to style my hair, but for a cheap refresher -- absoultely"
"i'm actually really surprised at the bad reviews here. i've been to this location for my past two haircuts and had pretty good experiences each time. good haircut, fair price, really friendly customer interaction. i will come back. i did, though, really like the last haircut i got."
this place is only good for a trim. which i've came to this location multiple times but decided  to get a cut. it's not great. the hair dresser was a bit stubborn and preferred to cut the way he thought was best even when i told him what i wanted. now i'll probably go to an actual salon to fix this.
"i must be honest and say that i did not start off with a great experience here with damian, but it was quickly turned around within 24 hours!  to start, angela was amazing and promptly fixed my hairstyle. then, vanessa, the owner, reached out to me personally to hear my concerns about my first experience.  she was very friendly about the matter and i feel as though she truly listened to what i had to say. it means a lot when the owner personally reaches out to make sure there is an acceptable solution to an issue. i will definitely be returning and will be sure to see angela for any future hair appointments!"
"i have no complaints about my haircut with sahara. she taught me how to take care of my hair properly and showed me products to consider buying but was not pushy with sales at all. she was super helpful, gave a great cut and i would definitely return to her for haircuts in the future."
"ruined my boyfriend's hair, didn't know how to fade, didn't know how to part, basically parted his hair twice, dont go here, and if you do, dont go to damien !"
"so, i just got the most amazing haircut ever. i have pretty complicated hair (thanks mom) but i got lucky and i got bianca and she took my curls from limp and boring to va va voom! i don't like getting my hair cut as i've had so many bad cuts in the past, but bianca surpassed my expectations.  now i'm going out to show off this hair!  and i'm going back for a color next week. haaaay. i highly recommend this salon, and bianca does a phenomenal job. thank you guys"
"nothing amazing but i can usually walk in after work and still be served pretty quickly. they also send out monthly coupons that take a couple bucks off. sometimes you will get a warm towel at the end, but not always."
"i'm surprised with the negative reviews, but many were from more than six years ago.  i saw complaints regarding other clients being taken first.  i suppose you weren't told to call when you're on the way and you'll be taken before any walk-ins.   simple.  i saw complaints about no shampoo or having it barely damp.  a shampoo is only a few dollars, but choose what you'd like.  there is no charge for using styling products.a good stylist knows your hair and what they can or cannot achieve.  and will let you know.  and will still try!  we know that!marlene and luz are the best!  luz went to s. mich, in case anyone wonders.  you can't go wrong with either."
"it is time someone updates the reviews for this place. what a mistake it was to come here. i came in on a  night that had a bad snow storm and to my surprise it was busy. i sat and waited while the 2 hairstylist finished up cuts and took other before me. they do not wash your hair and barley get it wet. the lady who cut my hair had no idea what she was doing. she said at one point, ""i am trying to figure out how to add layers!"" umm what?!?!? basic things you should know how to do. i left with a bad trim that will take me months to fix the crappy job she did.  what a waste of money this place was. bad trim and inside is so outdated."
"the management at supercuts  is very unprofessional.  they do not schedule appointments.   they do take ""reservations"" 45 minutes beforehand, but that does not guarantee you any service at a particular time.  explain that one.  a stylist here cut my hair three times in one year.  she did an absolutely  fantastic job.  then one day, she was gone.  (it is obvious now, especially after reading these reviews, that she took her talents to a more deserving salon.) after she left, i naively asked where she went.  they wouldn't say.  i asked her last name.  they also withheld this, claiming they don't share ""personal"" information for safety purposes.  that is plain bull because if i had the foresight, i would have asked her during my last haircut and she no doubt would have told me.  it was clear that supercuts wanted to keep my business for themselves.the manger assured me the other stylists were great.  i gave one a chance.  utter disaster. so long, supercuts.  you have shot yourself in the foot. to tessa the awesome stylist: if you are reading this, please post some kind of info here, that your loyal clients can bring you their business."
"i went to this location for a while for my haircuts.  the price is definitely right.if you are looking for a stylist that is going to wash your hair, give you a scalp, massage, chat about their weekend, and/or tell you how they are going to cut your hair, this is not your place.what you will get is a reasonably priced haircut and they will try to do exactly what you tell them.i stopped going here simply because i like the conversation and the ""honey, no...we're not doing that"" when i go...i need a little more intimacy, if someone's going to be man-handling my head.  :)"
"i've been coming to this supercuts location for over 15 years.... but today i had andrea for the first time.  she gave me, hand's down, the best cut i've had there or anywhere.  she's great with color too."
"i came in here for a cheap haircut a while ago. i have very fine hair, so i think it'd be easy to cut. there's also not a lot of it. anyway, i got home and looked in the mirror and it was not the same length on either side of my face. also, i got a lecture about having to use really expensive salon products if i want to have long hair. the information was presented to me in a ""duh, you're an idiot"" tone. sorry, but if i'm at supercuts, i'm obviously not going to drop a hundo on hair product."
"i don't know what happened right before i walked into this place but yikes!!  i had just moved to chicago and it was so so hot!!  and i need to get my long hair chopped down.  so i go someplace familiar and figure that it will be an easy enough process.  well when i walked in i could feel a weird vibe in the air.  a girl sits me down, is rough with washing and keeps getting water in my eyes.  and as she hacking at my hair and barely talking whatsoever, she is glaring at two other girls that work there everytime they walk by.  evil, dart-like stares thru the mirror.  so i am uncomfortable and leave and tell her i don't need a hair drying and it was hot out so who cares?!  right?  wrong.  i should have so i didn't have to pay for that haircut.  my ""long layers"" i asked for as i always do dried and ended up looking like a bad mullet-like hairdo.  i was horrifid and job hunting at the time.  so in the end i went to a nice salon and spent an extra $50 there - which yes, may have been an awful fate b/c i met my new stylist who fixed me up and i saw after that...but wow!  i've never had that awful of a haircut and sometimes just waiting for it to grow out is too long to wait!!  stay away from salons with negative vibes!!  someone just slept with someone else's bf or something...yikes!"
"i held on to my supercuts card for the longest time, hoping, just hoping that i can get that thirteenth haircut that would be free, but i can't do it. i just can't do it. too many bad haircuts here. while there are one or 2 competent employees here, most of the time, i get butchered.you know it's bad when you're a guy, and your haircut take more than oh, say 20 minutes? i don't have any fancy head of hair. #3 on the sides, 1/2 inch off the top. an experienced barber can do it in under 10 minutes.is that too much to ask? evidently. i need 1 more haircut till my next one is free, but i can't come back here. i just can't. luckily there's a great clips and a haircuttery on the same block. i advise checking out one of them first before going here."
i get my hair cut every three weeks like clock work.  i get it cut so frequently because i'm a little ocd about keeping it neat and short.  so because i'm a little crazy about it i don't have much loyalty to one particular stylist because i like to keep my options open so i can stay on schedule.  so today i went to try super cuts and was pleasantly surprised with thea.  she did exactly what i explained and my cut came out perfect.  i'll definitely be keeping thea's card in my pocket for next time.
"so disappointed in this place tonight.  this is not my regular hair salon to go to, but i was in a rush to get a hair cut.  i walked in and  the desk clerk, wrote down my name.  i waited for about 25 minutes and in the mean time another customer walks in and the desk clerk took down his name.  shortly after this the  desk clerk walked to the back and did not appear again for about 15 minutes.  so during that time, one of the hair stylist, looked on the desk where all our names were and took the customer who had just walked in.  how fair is that, i have been waiting for about half an hour and someone else goes before me.  also just to make a note, the other hair stylist working seemed to be disgusted that the front desk clerk kept disappearing and he had to go to the back to find her.  this was horrible customer service.  i ended up walking out and will plan on trying to squeeze in time during my busy day tomorrow to go to my regular hair salon."
"i googled a few hair salons near sheridan and belmont but didn't find anything less than $50 other than supercuts. i went in their yesterday and the sweet mexican stylist took me in right away and did everything i asked her to do; also, she gave me ideas on what might look better which was really helpful. i've been growing out my hair for 6 months because my last stylist messed it up, but this lady totally fixed my hair, and whatever she couldn't, she told me what to do. i loveee my new hair and i will definitely be going back! if you're looking for a nice haircut and cheapp ($14) then go to supercuts!"
the reviews from this supercuts were from months ago and apparently they made some changes.  my fiance and i went there last weekend and had haircuts.  i had a guy named jason who was able to look at my hair and know how long it's been since my last one and he did a fine job cutting my hair and making me look good.  the lady who did my fiance's hair did a wonderful job.  the price was right too.  excellent haircuts here by total professionals!
stylist kenny is very talented and skillful professional.  one of the best haircuts i have ever had.  call first to add your name to kenny's wait list and availability.
i don't want to give place 1 star. my son needed a haircut so i decided to go here. they looked at us but didn't say anything. the greeter guy didn't feel like greeting at us. he said hi in his lightest voice. that means i barely heard him. he never even told me to sign in on tablet. just rude. i couldn't see myself giving this place my money. please get your act together supercuts not...
"went in today june 14, 2o18 for a trim and color. my trimming came out good but when i asked for red color the guy shows me a dark violet... so when he finally shows me the actual red color i want from the book, we start to color my hair... wired thing is... i've never been to a place where they only color literally your head and not the rest of your hair?  so in the end my hair didn't turn out the way i wanted and the back of my head is a dark black/brown mix color.... i will be going back to see what this stylist can do to fix my hair but other than that i'm super upset. $80 for some half ass color? wtf is that.update. i went back the next day asking for a refund and the assistant manager was super hesitant telling me i needed to come back around 11am or 12noon because the stylist who did my hair starts his shift @ that time and how she didn't know how to work the small machine to give me my refund back on my card. then she tells me she can't give me any cash because there's no cash in the register... i didn't leave... i stood in my car for 20min. i went back in asking if she could just call the guy then because i want the issue resolved and starts giving me an attitude repeating herself telling me to come back so i bitched her out and told her this is ridiculous! ""your an assistant manager, you should know how to give refunds... they train you for that"" so finally i get the refund , and typed in my card info manually but it's been 2 days and i haven't received anything yet so not only will i continue to file a complaint to the better bureau, but i will also be returning to them about my money!!!!!"
"love this location! i used to go to foster and pulaski but this one is so much better. the interior is tasteful and modern. we always see dee! i take my boys, ranging in ages from 10 to 19, to her and she always does a great job. two of my boys have bouncy curls and wear their hair long and two get fades. they've never been disappointed."
"i have been coming to this location for over 15 years.  there are only a few old timers if you will. it doesn't mean they are old on the contrary good stylists. they do a good job and if for whatever reason you are unhappy or notice something wrong call them   i believe you have a week or so to bring it their attention right away.  their prices recently went up which was a bit of a surprise, but if you shop at jewel look on back of your receipt for a $3.00 saving. anyway, overall good experience as usual for the kids and my wallet."
"one word, kenny. go to him. he cut my hair exactly as i wanted which is surprisingly hard to do for other places around the area (not sure why).i use to come here pre fire and had pleasant experiences as well but no one tops kenny."
i love this place!  great service and they make you feel at home.  i got my haircut from sarah and love it.  all the stylists are very professional.  i highly recommend this place.
"kindly woman but when it comes to the hair ,asian one destroyed my hair and she was acting like she knew what she was doing and at the end i gave her tip and left disappointed. woman hair yes for this salon while men's sucks."
"supercuts in general are ok but one employee at this supercuts is a psychopath, i came in with long hair and sat down. within 4 minutes i had the worst haircut of my life. firstly the barber didn't offer to wet or shampoo my hair he just used clippers and yanked my hair out of my head, he didn't even attempt to make it even. it wasn't even close. he didn't blend the top and bottom half of my hair and the moment he finished my haircut he ran out of the store never to be seen again. in total my haircut was less than 5 minutes long and it was completely uneven, fair warning to anyone going to this store avoid the philippino male barber he's a meth-head psychopath. -eli"
excellent service. the young lady who answers the phone (i believe her name is grace) is a sweetheart to deal with any time i call in to schedule a call ahead and kenny the dude who cuts my my hair does a fantastic job as well! overall a very well run operation!
great cut for a supercuts!!! thank god it wasn't a lopsided mower job:) thanks supercuts!!
"wow, what an amazing experience i had. after going to hair cuttery for many years across the street on peterson (next to potbelly) i decided to come here when hair cuttery had made an appointment with me the same morning and then when i had arrived, refused to take my daughter in as a customer and told us to come back after 4 hrs (even with the appointment). so this supercuts had recently reopened after the fire and i never had tried it out. i came straight here since it was closeby and i asked if they would attend to my daughter since she chopped her hair off that morning. they immediately told me we could come in, and started on my daughter. we had dee as out stylist.i explained to them that my daughter got a hold of scissors and chopped her bangs off completely. my daughter is on the spectrum, so they needed to be extra patient with her and i'm always scared they won't be able to handle her. well they were so warm and nice! dee got her comfortable right away and kept telling her how cute she was which made her smile the entire time! they even gave me many options on what i could do with her hair and how we could hide the scalp that was showing in the front where her bangs used to be. i was a mess, crying going into this place after what hair cuttery put me through that morning, and we walked out of here with smiles and a good feeling inside. we found our permanent place for the kids haircuts. love them!"
"so blessed to have found this gem so close to home!  my daughter has super curly hair and wanted a trendy haircut to start senior year. we decided to take our chances with this new shop- and so glad we did! the outside is very deceptive- the inside is gorgeous!  urban loft feel, very spacious and clean. we walked in at 4 on a friday with no wait. now here's the best part- kenny!! it can be so hit or miss finding someone knowledgeable about cutting super curly hair, but kenny was amazing!! his technique was something we've never seen before and he gave my daughter the most awesome cut!! she's thrilled and, of course, so am i. i highly recommend kenny- we will be going back!!"
"i have to say that sarah is the best stylist i have ever had. i started coming to her about 7 years ago. two years ago we moved out of the city to glenview and my husband asked 'isn't there a supercuts closer to here?"" i still come back to sarah every time. she's the best! donna f from glenview."
"this is a great place. good looking loft environment, good music. sarah was welcoming, attentive and professional. she did a good haircut. will come back!"
i got a fantastic haircut from kim. i came in around 5 on a weekday and happened to have no one in line so the wait was short. kim took a bad haircut i was trying to grow out and she made it look great!  she was very friendly and we talked through the whole haircut. definitely recommend her.
"don't bring your kids here. i brought my school aged kids to this location since the foster and pulaski location is no more. the stylist nicked my son's ear with the clippers. she didn't even alert me when it happened, it was only until i noticed through blood she apologized. i was distracted from the minor incident that i didn't notice until i got home how awful his cut was. the only reason i gave this two stars is because the other male stylist did a decent cut on my other son. overall, unhappy and dissatisfied."
"this started out to be a one star review because when i went in for a haircut on 12/19/2016, i received a terrible haircut from a stylist whose name i believe is amanda. when i got home i realized the cut was uneven on both sides and the hair was actually sticking up on one side! i went back that evening and fortunately the young man (sorry, i didn't get his name) was able to take me and make everything right!  i've been a regular customer for many years and i love gloria and sara so thanks to this young man, i'll be back again. i don't usually complain, but i think the matter of the other stylist needs to be addressed."
"for somebody like me, a quick haircut here works just fine. i have thin, lank hair. even dippity do could not tame it. i am middle-aged, and not worried about looking hot or even ""cool"" to attract a mate. i want quick, easy, and neat. i got exactly that today. a hispanic lady chopped off two inches of hair, all one length. i'm happy with my haircut.but your hair is thick, curly, or you want some fancy cut, this may not be the place for you. if you're like me and you want to be in and out fast, and don't have complex demands, this is a good place."
my husband took my son in today to get a simple haircut. #5 on the sides and scissors on top. not that hard. he came home and after his bath i could see how completely butchered and uneven his hair turned out. this is totally unacceptable. pictures have been posted to the business yelp page.
"alba did a great job! love the color. my hair has lots of different colors (reds, blondes, and browns) and she was able to find a highlight color that works well with my skin tone and still have low lights showing. plus she put in this awesome shine spray that makes my hair feel silky and smooth. perfect look for summer. definately will be coming back soon!"
i've been here for my 2 most recent hair cuts and i could not be more satisfied.  i usually pop in on a weekday evening on my walk home. these are some of the nicest people who are genuine and full of character. the cuts are fantastic & reasonably priced. i do however think the salon itself could use a makeover
"please think twice before working there. the wages are very low and they fire you because a close friend is looking for a receptionist job, this is nepotism and prejudices. selfish patty is close minded and gets angry very easily. that tells you how they run their business when a manager, patty,  is behaves angrily over every little minor details. some customers are not satisfied when they leave their shop."
"alexis is lovely and so very sweet. i went in for the first time this afternoon for a root re-touch and also ended having my brows waxed. i've been to the high-end salons and paid double for the same services but i have to say, this experience seemed more enjoyable. yes, the place is a bit bleak with a very chain-like feel (because, duh, it's a chain) but alexis was so personable, chatty (but not in the fake/put-on sense) and did a really good job. plus, you can't get over the price. while i waited for the dye to set, alexis took another haircut appt. -she was so genuine and personable. the client left happy with his cut. seriously, people who write bad reviews about this place are the same people who complain that subway screwed up their sandwich order. they completely overlook that there's a real person who is trying to do exactly what the client asks for."
"i went in late saturday morning.  only had to wait about 10-15 minutes.  blanca cut my hair.  she listened to hear exactly what i said i wanted and proceeded to cut my hair to meet my request.  she is polite, profession, fast & efficient.  i will go back."
"this is my fault. i just needed a trim, an inch or 2 of my all-one-length long hair. sorry, but i just don't want or need to spend $60-$80 in a real salon for a maintenance trim- plus, i was driving by, and thought i would just try and knock this off the to-do list quick and get on with my day.i should have taken the hint when i saw the older lady in a wheelchair (customer) blow drying her own hair at one station, and another stylist walk past her and snarl behind her back in confusion and disgust. that same stylist then skipped me on the list and took a gentleman who had walked in 15 minutes after me. i had been next in line, and confronted her about this, but she inexplicably decided that i was not next. well- i took this as a sign, grabbed my coat and got the hell out of there. screw. that. add to this- outdated 80's décor, employees who are visibly irritated, and just a general air of.... sadness, and i think i got very lucky to be skipped. never again."
"i will start by saying the store in clean and well-lit. as for the quality of the haircut, i don't expect gold coast quality from the supercuts chain but they have certainly managed to lower the bar at this location. the last two haircuts i got there were from different stylists and were easily the worst haircuts i've gotten since i left the army. when a stylist asks 'how does that look?' and needs to be told that individual hairs shouldn't be standing straight up, there's a problem. and when the stylist cycles back and forth from the left side to the right working on my sideburns i just knew my sideburns had risen to new heights. but if you like your sideburns to start somewhere north of the top of your ears then this is the place for you. the next time i need a haircut and find myself near this location i will keep on walking. and the one star is actually a gift because there is no provision for a 1/2 star."
gotten my haircut here multiple times. i already have bangs and just need a trim. shouldn't be too difficult especially if they're already there right? i always get half done jobs aka half my bangs are trimmed other half are not even though i tip 100% and i get pushed out the door with wet hair. not a fan.
"i love this place. simple haircut, simple price. but... i'm so mad right now that i got leslie to cut my hair. kinda heavy set dark skinned lady if you don't recognize her name. but i had a haircut with her one time, wasn't very satisfied. she cut off a bit to much than i asked. i came in again, got her, and thought i would give her a second chance. horrible idea. this time it wasn't the haircut more than it was the service. i had to ask her to cut my sideburns as she was taking off the hair cover. she never asked me! aren't those standard?! and at the end, she never cleaned me up. i had hair all over my face, pinched a bunch of hair resting behind my ears, didn't get a blow dry after and left with wet hair. sorry, this is harsh, but i don't ever want leslie to touch me again. i'll come back for someone else.ps - came home, one side was uneven. yeah. damn."
its the most bad salon i have seen ever because i ask her to cut my hair like the pic i show to her but she decided to make a other hair style and ut was so ugly  hair style i got in my life  unfortunately you have bad team  and now there is no body can fix my hair coz now it's too short
"good luck getting a solid haircut here. if the people who worked at a place like this we're really skilled at what they do, they wouldn't be working at a place like this and there lies the problem."
"as an asian with super straight black hair, it is very hard to find a person of any ethnicity that can cut your hair well. i have been to a few 35 dollar places that can't figure out asian hair. amy at this supercut is the only one that can do it well. she gets the asian hair and all hair. you can tell when they cut with confidence--quickly yet it turns out great. when i use to have the short styled forward and up hair, she did a great job of cutting it for years but it's a simple cut and a lot of people can do it well. now that i have switched to the longer mad men style haircut, it was surprisingly difficult to find a place that can cut it well. i went to gabby's in lakeview (an old school barbershop) but they just gave me a confused look. i guess they're not used to cutting non-white hair. i went to a ""professional"" place--one of those robert jeffery place and the same thing. ""i didn't know asian hair can do that"", was what my guy said. alas, i return to amy (it's hard to catch her sometimes. call ahead..) and she knew exactly what to do. she is too good for supercuts but i'm not complaining.."
"five stars for the haircuts and prices, zero stars for their call-ahead arrangement. supposedly you are supposed to be able to call in up to an hour ahead and put your name on the list. i called and was told to be there in 35 minutes. i walked in 25 minutes later, my name was crossed off the list, and there were five people ahead of me...pretty much makes the call-ahead idea pointless! part of the problem is this particular location is often staffed with just two stylists. but if time isn't an issue and you want a cut for under $15, this is the place to go."
"my go to place for a budget haircut. when you have long, straight hair and don't need more than a trim, why pay more than $13? at this price, you've got plenty of money left over to splurge on a pair of $20 shoes at payless and some vitamin b at the vitamin store next door."
"slow service and unfriendly stylists. much better in the area. cheap price but you get what you pay for, a lousy haircut and poor service"
"i've been going here for awhile now and have made some realizations. 1. while blanca is the sweetest little latina, she butchers my hair every time. 2. amy rocks, and 3. thomas (septum piercing guy who is new to this location i believe) also rocks and has quickly caught up to tie amy as my favorite stylist!"
"i have been going to this location since it opened.  i don't know the precise year, but i'm guessing about 15 years.i went last week and got a new stylist.  she was nice, but she didn't do as i asked in shaping the back of my hair.  so, all week, no matter what i did, pieces of it just stuck out at all angles.this happened once before, ages ago.  i went in and the next stylist fixed it.  i went in today and explained the problem.  they would not fix it unless i paid again.  ok, i'll spring for it.  the stylist completely ignored me and took off more than 1 inch.  i couldn't see the real damage as i am blind without my glasses.  i have a growth behind one ear that usually is concealed and is now totally noticeable.i was furious - and yes, he rang me up.  i asked at least twice, ""why didn't you do wha i asked you to do?""  he ignored me and just said that if i wasn't satisfied, i could go to a high end salon and pay $100.after fifteen years of business, that is it.  i'm outta here."
"i've been coming here for haircuts for many years. i have very easy hair to cut and i get a great haircut from all the stylists. for me, it's a great value."
"i happened to be walking by this location and in need of a haircut. i decided to walk in on a whim and sairz, the manager, greeted me with a great smile and took me right away. she did such a great job with the cut that i came back four weeks later for color and another cut. today, it was very busy but sairz and her staff never missed a beat. they were eternally pleasant and everyone seemed happy with their service. definitely should check it out!"
"i got a haircut today and it was horrible. i told the lady i want a low taper fade on the sides and keep the top (i used to have long hair), but the lady just shaved my hair into a super short cut. i could tell that lady wasn't professionally trained. (she also said i have slim eyes, because i'm asian)"
"thursday 6pm, was on my way to dinner with friends. decided that my hair was too flat and needed a blow dry. i frantically searched for salons that were open during that time around the area - loop. all near me were closed/closing, except supercuts... i've never been to one of these places and to be honest was scared to start now. i decided i wanted a quick trim, and i wanted a 'lob' (long bob), but i knew they wouldn't know what that is, so i crossed my fingers and walked in.*$ide-note on pricing: their prices were competitive to salon prices: $50+ for blow dry, $17 for haircut, and $5 to be washed. the only deal i see is if you get the haircut alone, but dry cuts are not what i'm used to. a nearing high end salon, has varying prices for haircut depending on level, but let's say junior stylist is $60 for haircut, that comes with a scalp massage, and blow dry/style, so it's actually more cost effective, just an fyi.i digress. the woman who cut my hair, elder african american lady, was very kind and stuck to the photo i showed her. i loved my hair and will come back if i'm ever stuck in a time crunch again."
worst haircut ever had... the old lady is more like mowing a lawn rather than cutting my hair. attitude and service are also terrible. don't come.
"this supercuts has been great for me every time. ask for sairz, my favorite stylist!"
"called in the morning about making an appointment for the evening and was told they don't take appointments. kinda odd but okay. i asked if i could come in at 5:30 and was told that was too late since they close at 6:00. i asked if i could come at 5:00 and was again told that was too late. i asked when i should come in and the woman told me to come back at 4:30. i arrive at about 4:32 and was told by the person at the desk that it was way too late for a blow out and that there were 4 people in front of me. i only saw two people in the salon and they supposedly don't take appointments. also, i wasn't asking for an updo or anything fancy it shouldn't take more than a half hour to blow my hair out straight. very irritating seeing as now it is too late to make an appointment anywhere else."
"i have gone to andrew twice last year to get my haircut and he always does an amazing job! granted i don't get anything crazy, just a trim and a few layers, but he does not disappoint! go with andrew and i guarantee you'll get the same quality haircut than those upscale salons that want to charge $75 for a haircut."
"my best friend sent me here and recommended i see venita. i went last saturday for color and a cut. i can now say i have my stylist in chicago!  venita listens. would give her more stars if they were available. i have a television shoot in dallas next week, so i'm going back this saturday for a blow dry & flat iron style. thank you soooooo much venita. you're the best!"
"great deal for shampoo and blow dry!  very flexible with time availability, the hairstylist are friendly and have always done a great job blow drying and straightening my hair.  great savings!"
"nice and friendly service. always clean and we'll kept which can be a nice break from some of the other spots in the city. they have six stations available and every time we've been in they have had 2-3 stylists working. never had to wait more than just a few minutes for the hubs to get a haircut. very short walk from the van buren metra station. exit on the michigan avenue side of the street. usually in and out within about 20 minutes. the hubs is relatively new to the city so supercuts is a brand that he is familiar and comfortable with so he prefers to trek up here from hyde park. when we're back in san diego we will typically patronize local spots but also hit up supercuts periodically. like most chains, it's a very consistent experience and a very consistent price."
"when i go there next month, i'm looking forward to a barber whose scissors are sharp so that the hair is cut and not yanked, someone who can use the clippers to make the sides match without gouges too close to the scalp, and someone who can square off the sideburns so that they match on each side.  you know, like an experienced barber does."
i work around here so i always go to supercuts. my stylist is this amazing girl. i believe her name is vinita.she is awessommeeeeeeeee.
"pros:great location: in the loop, next to office buildings, right on michigan avecons:1. really poor customer service. rude and disrespectful staff2. long wait times. they only have two people staffed at a time so it takes 30-40 mins before it is your turn3. poor system for management of queue. don't seem to respect online appointments. very ad-hoc4. staffers take long breaks before moving to their next appointment.advisable to go to other locations nearby"
"i can't decide whether or not i'll be returning.pros: i paid $15.95 + a $5 tip. i was helped right away by a really nice girl (my receipt said he name was kate or kat...literally that's what the receipt said).cons: i was in and out in about 20 minutes...which is good, but in past salons i've spent about 45 minutes. i didn't opt for the shampoo, but it still seems like it should have taken slightly longer. and it should have, because i didn't really get the layers that i wanted, but my bangs turned out nicely, and that was my biggest reason for running in for a trim."
we generally show up between 3 and 4 p.m. weekdays so there is never a very long wait to get a haircut.  everyone that works there is professional and provides a decent haircut.  no complaints.
"i've been here before, i am a woman with long hair, all one length, and i just needed a trim. a trim. i asked the guy stylist for 2 inches off. he ended up taking more like 4 or 5 inches. i'm kind of pissed. he kept checking in with me, but frankly, i couldn't tell he was lopping that much off at the time. it wasn't until i stood up did i realize how much was gone- and then what was i going to do about it? ugh. ladies- stand your ground and be vigilant."
"i didn't get my hair done. here's why: i came in looking for a wash and blow-dry. i was expecting to pay around $30-$50 which is what i've paid in the past at other salons. i actually thought it might be cheaper because, let's be serious, this is supercuts, the walmart of hair. the price they first quoted me was $50, but then the stylist looked over and said: ""well, her hair is past her bra so it would actually be $75""seventy five dollars to blow dry my hair? no thanks. i walked around the corner and had it done at a fabulous place (fuga) for $45, and even got an excellent coffee with it."
"i went to this establishment for the first time to get a simple bob haircut and came out damn near bald. the ""stylists"" who cut my hair had terrible customer service, he acted like he didn't want to speak which was a second red flag. the fact that the receptionist's hair wasn't combed was the first, however she did speak. i've been getting haircuts at supercuts for years and have always come out happy, until i went here. i rate this place a c ---for close and b for bad customer service.  if you need a cut, run pass this place. #sucks"
"my hair is easy: i keep it buzz short (#1 - #2, depending on the season). you don't really ""cut"" my hair; it's more like a ""mow"" with the clippers.i've always gotten a good, but nothing-to-write-home-about mow at supercuts. not really a supercut, but a sosocut. i haven't been a regular; i just pop in if i'm in a hurry and i'm not popping in to a mom & pop (or usually, just pop) barber.i hadn't been here in a while, but i needed a quickie today, and vanita was perfect for the job! she cut with precision, and was quick to boot. she has a great attitude, a heart-warming smile, and is sweet (but not sugary) like dark chocolate.i've never requested a stylist (or mower) at supercuts, but i'm putting vanita in my little black book (ok, black samsung gs3) right now."
i love it here! it's so close to everything in the city and very convenient for n my way home from work. my favorite stylist is vani. she's very sweet and always has great conversations with you. makes you feel welcomed and good time spent. getting a haircut in other places i feel can be overpriced and sometimes not good. they now have an app for supercuts which is very easy to make appointments. i use it every time.
"very clean and nice and welcoming service. i got my haircut just what i wanted, so i shouldn't complain. men's haircut is decent here. within $15 you might get a good haircut deal including the tip. they use quality products too.$2 off when you are a vet or student, show them your ids. $1 off when you check in from there android/ios app$2 off when you check in on yelp"
"my dother and me  had haircuts month ago , was very good,clean, friendly, good service .we not go no where else. best value for the money."
great stylist good prices .im going to tell my friends to get the color i got. they are friendly
this location is always running behind. plan to wait 30-40 minutes from your appointment time before you see a stylist.  this is a reoccurring issue they have.  one of the stylist is very obnoxiously well.
"came to get a hair cut, told her the basics simplest haircut, she totally ruined my hair, make me like mushroomed head. totally disappointed and angry! highly not recommend. bad bad bad hair stylest nora. overpriced with rookie hair stylest over all."
great place to get a hair cut. you can ask for the style you want and the people are super nice and very helpful. darsjan
"i came here before and it was fine, today i went back and i don't think i will go there again. i asked for an long a line bob with long layers and showed multiple photos, thought i was very clear on this, got the hair cut, it was not what i asked for, asked for an a line bob again, patricia (the stylist) proceed to tell me how she had cut the hair into an a line, i was confused because the hair was not a line, she then tried to cut the hair again but was frustrated and finally said for another stylist to cut the hair because she wanted me to get what i wanted. at this point the hair wasn't savable although patricia tried to tell me it was. the other stylist cut my hair, again too late to save the hair now. i paid my $14 and left. 1 hour and 30 minutes and $14 dollars lost (i think they gave me a $2 discount for ruining my hair). very disappointing and embarrassed to walk around. haircut is not what i wanted at all but noway to put hair back on. both stylist were trying to be nice. patricia seems like a new stylists and wasn't sure what she was doing and consistently asked the other stylist for help.update:gerald, the owner, messaged and called me to try and make things right. i appreciate his excellent customer service however my hair is already to short to be cut anymore. he offered styling and product consulting if i was willing to go by, but unfortunately i will be out of town (hence why i got my hair cut in the first place)."
"came in not expecting much, figured it was just another chain haircut place. was pleasantly surprised with the service, results, and experience! online check in is super easy and gets you a $1 discount. my stylist ashlee was incredibly kind and went out of her way to make sure i got exactly what i wanted! she engaged me in conversation and made me really feel welcomed. would recommend to anyone in the west side looking for an affordable, quality haircut. will certainly be coming back!"
"over charged my 89 year old mother, wash blow dry $49.00. that ridiculous. jennifer press you should be ashamed...... then told my mom 'you were not charged the correct price in the past. so how was my mom to know your establishment was charging her the wrong price in the past.if you about customer service you would have just let her know and charged her what she paid in the past, and then going forward she would have the option to make the decision on her own.clearly you are about money, not customer service."
"this is an update to my previous review: these guys went out of their way to make things right: they fixed my haircut and i am very happy with the results.i was very impressed that the owner himself contacted me after my first yelp review, taking it upon himself to make sure things were made right.(it appears that this location has recently changed hands and is under new ownership, so older reviews may be outdated.)i'm giving these guys 5 stars for excellent customer service."
"went here for a longer mens haircut. the barber messed up and cut a giant chunk out of by bangs, then apologized and kept just trimming it as if i was going to walk around with a giant chunk missing out of my bangs. i ended up with a 1in haircut. do not go here."
"i got my haircut today, again thinking the location was convenient and the price was right. let me tell you, i had a terrible experience. my hairdresser spoke very little english. she heard them mention ""the c word"" on the radio, and proceeded to ask me what that meant. i played dumb and said that i wasn't sure. then she asked me if it was the word cunt, and she wanted to know the word meant. not what i was expected on my thursday morning.oh, and about the haircut. i am at work so i haven't had too much time to gaze in the mirror, but i'm not a fan. the main thing i notice is that she took a very large amount of hair off around my ears exposing far too much scalp."
this place was pretty clean. i would go back cheap and friendly3 stars is all it is getting from megood luck
"i usually will try not to give bad review and i always will try to give people benefit of the doubt. i had my hair cut done at this suppercuts location and the experience i here is very bad. the store supposed to be open at 9am and when i went there at 9:15am the door is still lock and i have to wait for someone to come open the door.   when i came for hair cut i show the hairdresser the picture on what i want my hair cut to look like and how short i want it to cut. needless to say my hair got butchered.  i afraid to tell the hairdresser that my hair on my side is uneven and unbalance, because when i told her the 1st time she cut my hair shorter and it still uneven. the end result of the hair cut is nothing like the hair cut in the picture. i understand for 16 dollar hair cut it is cheap so i won't have good quality haircut, but the staff seem unprofessional and unfriendly during the whole process. i won't be coming back to this location to have my hair cut and i will advices try other place."
"i wanted this place to work out for me. so close to my place and a very affordable rate. although i was a bit disappointed with the actual haircut.the sign up sheet was actually a post-it note on the counter. there was confusion who actually got their first so it comes down to people being honest, which is fine. to make up a quick excel sheet with name and time arrived would seem to be a simple solution.the stylist who cut my hair seemed that she didn't want to be at her job. my haircut is pretty simple, a 1.5 guard on the side and a 3 on top and fade them together. i ended up with a weird line at the top of my head that didn't look natural. she did ask me where i wanted it trimmed up to, but i have never been asked that before, and thought it was a given to make it look natural.i am going to give them another shot. i would call ahead next time as there were three people ahead of me. all said and done it was about a hour and half by the time i walked out the door."
"time to get the hair did. oh who am i kidding, buzzing my furry mop every few months isn't all that difficult, but managing the colics is another issue. i refuse to pay more than $25 for a fade in the city of chicago, so supercuts has its moments of clarity. they generally trim me up nice and neat, and every once in awhile it looks pretty darn good. it is unfortunate that store policy doesn't allow the stylists any creative form or flexibility with their cuts, so the standard trim is about all you should expect.i have never had a problem with the waiting list. just keep in mind that people sign in and come back later, so just because you thought you were their first, does not mean it happened that way. use a little forethought and planning as well. dont show up at peak hours on friday, sat, sun, or after 5pm on most weekdays if you dont expect to wait for 15 minutes. try an off hour like 2:30pm or early morning on a weekend for your best bet with the lines. even on the worst days, ive never sat more than 30 minutes here. i definitely agree with rusty s., come here if youre in the area, have a coupon, and aware of the possible wait. it is very true they do not seem to have a concept on staffing, however, the profit margin may not accommodate it either. ill be back until i find something easier or cheaper."
"karen was great, haircut was fast and she did a great job. no excessive talking but not weirdly quiet. in and out fast, took care of everything and was very friendly. price can't be beat. will definitely go back."
"i went here because the location was convenient.  i am not someone who is super particular about every detail.  still, this was the worst haircut i have ever had.  absolutely no attention to natural curls and waves.  it is actually more like a man's haircut than a woman's.  and it's a bad man's haircut.  everywhere there is a curl or a wave, there are ends sticking out.  she tried to defeat the big wave in front that i said could not be defeated.  i certainly will not go here again, or even anywhere near a supercuts."
"we decided to take john in for a haircut today, overall okay man haircut."
"was told that there would be a 30 minute wait, there was 2 people ahead of me. a man who came after me also was told that there was a wait and he decided to wait also. at the moment when my turn came mona the stylist walked over to the computer and told the man after me that she was sorry that she didn't realize that he emailed to schedule his appointment, (that funny why didn't he mention that either?) they guy looked surprised (i take it he did not schedule) she just realized that she would get a bigger tip from him. horrible customer service! will never go here again. mona is money hungry!"
"well this is hard for me to do due to my own selfishness and greed, but i believe in karma and the power of yelp so here goes:  ana is just great! i recently started visiting this location as ana transferred over from another location.  as it turns out, she is actually closer to me, which says a lot as i dislike commuting but i was willing to travel a bit to have her cut my hair. ana is first and foremost a consummate professional.  she's great at her job, at communicating, at giving suggestions, about remembering her customers and their nuances, and in addition to that she's just a kind and caring person.  i highly recommend this supercuts location and specifically, ana.  extra bonus:  she will even help you learn spanish while cutting ‍ your hair."
"i often come here to get a quick haircut during my lunch hour.  was very pleased with my stylist maria,  not only was she very quick, she was quiet and not overly chatty.  lines were perfect and and haircut is still looking good 2 weeks later.  excellent work!"
"after the original review, jennifer r. the district ""leader"" contacted me to offer my money back.  i accepted.  it has now been five weeks, and i have not received a check.  i have followed up with her via email, and she has not even bothered to reply.not only can i not trust ""super""cuts to do an ok job on a haircut, i can also not trust them on customer service.  you should second guess yourself if you are going to trust them and may want to search for other places that cut hair.  there are more than a few others in downtown chicago.maybe there is a regional ""leader"" who will still make this right?if i could take away the one remaining star, i would."
calling ahead of booking online means nothing and they never have enough people working.  find some place else
"customer service promised that the district leader will reach out to me. it never happened. they made me call and submit a ticket. terrible service, terrible customer care!one week ago ----------------------------------------------------------------their messagehi,thank you for sharing your experience at our supercuts salon in chicago.  i am sorry it wasn't a better one. you mentioned that you were unhappy with your haircut.we take all feedback very seriously and would like the opportunity to make this right. if you are interested in discussing this with a district leader, please feel free to reach out to our guest services team at 1-888-456-2887 or at the following address: departmentcs@regiscorp.c....  to connect with the supervisor of the salon please visit:"
"probably the worst haircut i've ever gotten. as i looked in the mirror at the end of my haircut i noticed the stylist had cut a chunk of hair off the side of my head in the middle. to make matters worse, chrissy, my stylist, claimed that she didn't do it! i understand mistakes happen, but i can't believe this stylist didn't admit what she did or offer to fix it. luckily the manager, sherri, offered me a full refund. i went to another place where they were able to blend it in. i'll still have to wait for it to grow back for it look normal again. i won't be back to this salon."
"upon entering the stylist did not introduce  herself.  she just asked what kind of haircut i wanted.  i showed her several photos of haircuts. which was many layers and face framing layers (i have very long hair).  when she was done, it looked like she just took a bowl and cut around my top layer.  my hair was all one length and now, i have just have two layers; one layer that ends at my ears and the other the goes down my back.  my hair looks horrible and i am in tears.  the towel service they promise was not provided either.  overall, unsatisfactory.  i will never entrust my best feature with a supercut.  it was my fault for thinking i could get a decent haircut for $16.95.  i literally got what i paid for.  #lifelessonsif you wish to look nice and end with a suitable haircut, do not go here.  it is better to go to an asha type salon and get a haircut done correctly.  it is worth paying the money."
"i don't know how much there is to say about supercuts in general, but i was happy with this location. the staff were polite, i got a haircut in about 15 minutes with no wait (reserved online in the morning), and they seem pretty busy and clean.apparently this is the first time i've seen them give me a hot towel to wipe off my face from the haircut though, which is a nice plus.really, does anyone ever have a giant story from getting a haircut if a: you're a man who doesn't know much about hairstyle or b: nothing horrific happened? i'd imagine not."
"reading some of the reviews i was scared to get my haircut here. but i was desperate and out of time so i walked in after work today and got my hair cut by maria. she was quiet (which i prefer) but did a god job and was quick about it. it's not the best haircut i've ever had, but it's certainly not the worst either, especially for the money."
"i was a loyal customer for three years. my stylist, ivonne, is great and deserves a five-star rating on her own.but since this location started trying to high-tech up appointments with their snazzy new app, my last four appointments have been ignored. i call (or now app) ahead, clear that hole in my day and make the trip in, and find myself on the same wait as if i hadn't scheduled at all. three of my last four attempted haircuts resulted in me running out of waiting time and leaving with nothing accomplished.i like ivonne and i wish she could still cut my hair, but time and principle force me to another haircut place that will honor appointments and its customers' time. very disappointing.looking for recommendations for a good, reasonably priced men's haircut option in the loop!"
"started coming here a few months ago. haven't had a bad cut yet. then again my hair is really short, pretty much a high and tight.love the online sign up process. super convenient."
"worst. haircut. ever.   except for the last time i went there 2 years ago.i was clear about what i wanted -- clean up my cut, trim about an inch, longer on top than the sides.  i came in with a side part, and left with a center part.  not my idea.   i don't know what the gal was thinking about, but it wasn't my haircut.  she made it lumpy and lopsided, and i decided to leave rather than see if i could talk here through getting it right.  i don't have enough hair for that.   back to the haircuttery on halsted for me.  they always do a nice job, and it is equally inexpensive.  but like night and day."
"i have been going here for about 3 years as it is convenient to go get a haircut on lunch break while working in the loop.  there is a woman here who has cut my hair probably 25 times over the course of my frequenting this establishment, and every time i end up with her, she does a real great job.  i wish i knew her name.  i think it's wendy.  i should find out.granted, my haircut is easy (well, really, what do i know, i don't cut hair).  but you just take a 1 guard around the sides and back, then fade it up to the top of my head and leave about 1"" of hair up there.  so it sounds pretty easy to me.  anyways, i have always been happy with the haircuts i walk out of here with. i tried to get an $8 hair cut at some latin american type place near my house and walked out with a way crooked fade and a big chunk of hair missing from the back of my cranium.  i of course can not see the back of my own head, and in retrospect the haircutter there curiously did not give me a mirror to inspect her handywork, so when i got home my girlfriend's roommate politely pointed out that the back of my head looked ridiculous.  this has not happened at supercuts in the thompson center and for that i is grateful."
"have you ever been hit on by a guy so sleezy and so below your standards that you felt like you needed to take a shower afterward, just from being spoken to?  yeah, that's what supercuts felt like to me.  if you've read any of my other reviews, you know that i am 100% loyal to my gia at the charles ifergan salon.. the place that brings you lemon waters and treats you like a queen each time you go.  well, during budget craze where for a brief moment i considered haircuts a ""non-essential"" item, i decided that supercuts may be a decent choice for a simple trim.  i mean, cut and tip for less than twenty? i thought this was the answer to my budget woes.  well, my hair has never recovered from the emotional trauma since, and i will never consider haircuts a non-essential budget item again.honestly, ladies, a hair cut isn't just about the cut.  sure, you need someone with great technique and who can make you look beautiful (neither of which supercuts offers), but more than that, going to a salon is also a spiritual experience.  there is nothing like sitting in the chair having your hair cut by someone who looks just as hip and beautiful as you want to feel.  you want to look around and see other people who care enough about their appearance to put in the time to come to a nice salon.  you want to be pampered and made to feel like a goddess in a place with aesthetic furniture, calming music, and the sound of stiletto heels on the ground.going to supercuts was like walking into a grocery store.  not the hip whole foods type of grocery stores with milfs walking around.  it was like going to a grocery store in the middle of the afternoon where you see people walking around aimlessly like they are just trying to distract themselves from the fact that they don't have a job.  it's like walking into some fashion bug type store off a recommendation from a co-worker only to discover that it's a store where fashion comes to die and you know you have to escape before someone you know spots you.  i feel dirty just writing this review b/c i feel dirty for having ever walked into the store.  there is no amount of frederick fekkai products i can buy to make up for what i did, and just the mere thought of having ever walked into this salon makes my skin crawl.  what the hell was i thinking?and if hating supercuts makes me a snob, then a snob i will be.  but unless you've done it yourself, don't judge.  it was truly that awful."
"nothing special. i went in with my friend to get hair cuts and we both exchanged glances as we realized all of the customers were males (not something we're used to at salons.) we both work near by and needed inexpensive haircuts asap. i noticed all the women working also looked the exactly same (must be family owned franchise or something..) after waiting about 30 minutes i got a cut, basically a trim because i was too scared to complicate/confuse the dresser (the cuts they were giving all the men didn't look too good). i left with just a few inches off, i basically look the same. my friend also had the same feeling, they didn't really do much. so for about $20 including tip, it was okay. i wouldn't ask for anything too picky, they don't seem very experienced. though, i don't think i'll go back."
my cut and highlights are perfect at 1/2 price other placescut depends on who you get  but sheri and gina are the best!this place is closed weekends
"i'm going to engage in a bit of wacky, so-called reverse stereotyping and say that this is what happens when you get your hair cut by a straight guy. i'll admit that i am 50% at fault for my unsatisfactory haircut, as i tend to forget the description of what i'm looking for, but the guy may well have decided to make his own decision regardless. he didn't cut the top short enough, and he explained that he did so because i would look too bald otherwise. uh, thanks for the editorializing, dude.i knew i should've sat back down and made him cut it down, but i felt like i was in some kind of twilight zone, or tractor beam, or insert your preferred dorky sci-fi simile here, and i also felt like this guy had opinions too strong to be overruled by pitiful ""customers,"" so i just gave up hoping that i could get it fixed at the other loop location, where i'd had much better service. this place is closer to my work, but who cares! if someone's gonna cast aspersions on me, they oughta at least give better results."
"how is it possible to have someone else do your hair, yes, for $45 at supercuts - and have it look worse than your own paltry efforts. i don't know how it's possible, but the wierd little chick who washed, blow dried and used the flat iron on my hair managed to do so. for the thompson center, you'd think they'd have a better ""quicky"" salon than this flea bag shop.  i've never paid more than $30 for a cheapy quicky, but i accounted for its being in the thompson center. huh-uh. location has nothing to do with the quality (not) of service (and subsequent lack thereof)  in this place. frankly, i think the place felt creepy...i couldn't wait to get out of that chair, and i swear - i do a much better job - and i can't see the back of my head!"
"i really am sorry to see the horrible reviews on here. i have only seen one person here, yolanda. i was tired of paying for pricey haircuts and being miserable after i leave with an ugly haircut. i figured, if i'm going to walk around with ugly haircuts, i might as well be paying $15 for them. i walked in, as they do not take appointments, and was seen quickly by yolanda. i am a woman and wear my hair short, like a pixie cut. yolanda had me skipping out of there in 20 minutes. my haircut was so cute, and it only cost $15! i went back, same thing. again and again. i have been going to her for at least a year now, and short hair needs a trim every few weeks. once or twice it isn't quite right, but i go back in a few weeks and it's great. i've tried growing the side, growing the bangs, angling the cut, and yolanda keeps up. i'm going back today."
"i agree with one of the other people that reviewed this supercuts location, i wish there were negative ratings. giving one star is too generous. i was told to see yolanda by a friend. well, yolanda did one hell of a hack job on my hair and then thought she could camouflage by blow drying and then flat ironing my hair.  i tried to live with it for a few days. couldn't, so i went back and teecha (sp?) was the next person that i tried. i say person and not stylist because that would not be an accurate description. she tried to clean up yolanda's mess but failed. i went back to her once more thinking all i needed was to let it grow out a bit so there would be more to work with. uhmm yeah, i was wrong. i went to a professional on saturday and when she combed out my hair and showed me how bad it was i wanted to scream! how do you cut off too much hair and then try and cover it by leaving the next layer longer?! never again!"
"i've been going to higher end salons for 40 years to get my  hair cut.  i would go to the same person for several years, then they would quit, or move to a salon further away from where i lived, and i would have to find another person.  i finally bit the bullet and decided to go to a ""supercuts"", which happens to be 5 minutes from my house and which i know was low priced, so i always figured it would be so-so haircuts.  (you know, ""you get what you pay for"").  well, let me tell you, i was pleasantly surprised by my first visit.  yes, i had to wait, but that is the way it is. so i learned to call in advance for an appointment, and hardly ever wait now. but that's not the best part.  what i was so happy with was the lady who cut my hair.  her name is martha.  she not only is one of the friendliest and pleasant people i've dealt with in the hair cutting world, she also can cut hair!  each time i've gone in, (probably about 6 times now over 1 and half years), she has listened to me and given me a great cut.  today was the best yet!  i showed her several pictures of what i wanted, (knowing that you can't always get the cut you want, if you don't have the same hair as the person in the picture!), and she did a fantastic job.  i would recommend supercuts, not only because it is extremely fair priced, but you get a great hair cut too! thanks martha, you  made my day!"
"arg, you get what you pay for. i had a stylist (i think her name was donna?) and she did a horrible job. i wanted a layered cut--same cut i have been getting for years--and she told me it wasn't possible. the end result was an ugly, ragged cut that i had to get corrected elsewhere. not coming back again."
"just wanted a blow dry. hair is crazy frizzy, and i asked her if she could fix it and she blamed it on my hair. i could have done it better myself. very disappointing."
"i used to go here years ago but had bad luck, but i think it changed ownership over a year ago so that's when i decided to give it a try again. my sons and i have been here a few times over the past few months on weekday afternoons and had good experiences. there was not much wait, we got really nice haircuts and the ladies were friendly. plus they'll take the supercuts coupons you have even after the expiration date, making the price quite reasonable.so i don't know why currently there are some negative reviews.  i have no complaints and we'll be back."
"i come to supercuts in the glen because of a fabulously, talented stylist named martha. she is kind, funny and gives me a terrific haircut every time. she is always in a good mood with a great smile. martha is an extraordinary stylist. you cannot beat the haircut for the price. please give her a nice tip because she deserves it! i would follow her anywhere because she's the best!!!"
"i started my experience by check in online at 10am. the website said '25 minutes"" i went in at 10:15 and stated i check in online and the lady said, ""wait and i""ll take you shortly"".shortly after a young man walks in and signed in and she took him right away.  which upset me since i've been waiting and had checked in online earlier... all meanwhile i have to listen to one of the stylist with a eastern european accent rip on our president, talk about how horrible our country is, and bad mouthing our military.....after waiting an additional 20 minutes, i had to leave since i was supposed to get my haircut 30 minutes earlier.... and had to get to an 11:30am meeting nearby it was very disappointing at the service and attitude these employees have towards their customers and our country...."
"my family and i have been getting our  haircut with teresa for over 10 years. although she has moved around quite a bit, we've managed to follow and keep up with her because she is really amazing. teresa is especially good at cutting and layering hair for both men and women. we have never had a bad experience and that's why we always come back. i recently colored my hair for the first time with teresa and she did a beautiful job. if you're going to supercuts, make sure to set up your appointment with teresa. she is absolutely phenomenal, you will not regret it!"
"i really love the work my stylist does and have been going there for years.   there are few changes that i don't care for:  1) they removed the tv years ago, so during cubs/hawks games i went somewhere else as not to miss the games  2) they now don't take appointments unless the stylist is actually there."
"quite possibly the worst haircut ever gotten in the last 10 years. i guess you really do get what you pay for. i walked in the door and the two stylist that we're still there were arguing about something. then got a haircut and the lady just absolutely butchered half my head.  i will never go back here. first time kama just moved into the neighborhood, never again."
teresa cut my hair and does an awesome job! she is so professional and makes sure i come out of the salon satisfied and beautiful! she is awesome at what she does. you should ask for teresa!
great haircut for the price. can't beat it. teresa's been my go to for years. recommend her for a quick and quality haircut. remember to call ahead because they fill up quick at times.
"i went to just have 1"" cut. this was a simple straight cut which is why i went to super cuts. zarina ( name she told me ...by the time i asked for it she knew i was very unhappy with the job she did...) cut 3"" off. she kept insisting in order to make it even she needed to cut this much. i asked to see any of the hair she cut that was at the 1"" i requested but she said it was on the floor and mixed with other people's hair. there was no hair that was 1"". it was an awful experience. if she can't do a simple cut i would be very wary of going to this super cuts."
consistently good haircuts at a very reasonable price! i've been a client of teresa's for more than ten years and have always been happy with my haircut. she's very enthuziastic and provides excellent customer service. i highly recommend supercuts @ patriot bvld. ask for teresa!
"show up at 815p, location is scheduled to close at 9p. no other customers in the store, after sitting for a minute, ""stylist"" comes out from the back and asks if i come back tomorrow. since when do businesses turn paying customers away, 45 minutes prior to closing? my hair cut takes 5 - 10 minutes at most. no, i will not come back and give you my money when it is more convenient for you. i can understand if there were multiple customers in store but there were none and this isn't the first time this has happened. on a positive note, when i have gotten my hair cut here, they've done a fine job. will try out sports clips, great clips, hair cuttery or one of the other options out there..."
"it all depends on who cuts your hair. martha and an asian lady that have cut my hair do an excellent job. this other person who works on sundays butchered my hair twice. she will not be cutting my hair again!in the future, i will only have martha or the asian lady cut my hair."
"checked in online. promised zero wait time. i get there. two people available. and yet i'm made to wait for over 10 minutes. in my view, defeats the purpose of checking in online.  also - one the haircut people always have to get the phones which doubles the time of your haircut. however i'm most miffed about checking in online and then having to wait - especially when there are multiple people available. if they want to take breaks that should be factored into the expected wait time and not made as zero."
"i had my hair cut and colored by christina last weekend.  the color turned out okay but the haircut was awful..... the worst i've ever received.  she totally hacked at my hair.   just be advised.... you get what you pay for!update: 12/2013 - worst.haircut.ever!!!  another hack job. this place is a crapshoot.  just because someone has gone to beauty school doesn't mean they can give a good haircut.  i've been coming here for a few years now and i've been lucky to get a string of good stylists (2), but they eventually leave for better jobs.  then, i have to try my luck with a new stylist.  sigh"
"if i could give negative, i would.  rude, rude, rude is the only word i can think of when it comes to the blonde stylist; cheryl i believe is her name.  not to mention rough.  my 12 year old  told said to me ""mom.  she was mean.  she kept yanking my head around really hard."" why let people put name on list if they go in only to be told another 30-45 minutes??  will never go back even though it is pretty much across street from my house.  would rather drive 20 minutes out of my way to get my son's haircut."
i've been happy with this place for a cheap hair cut that is decent and covers the basics.  i've been to many of the different hair cutters and they all do a good job.
"love this place for the money as long as i never have cheryl !!!!!!!!!!soooo much of her personal phone calls, personal drama, all about cheryl attitude.  she is more interested in getting you in and out of her chair in as little time as possible to rack up the $$$$$.  i suppose supercuts loves that about her but as for the customer.....i come to relax and have my hair done, not hear her drama and see pictures of her latest boyfriend etc etc ad nauseum........she is very unprofessional but cuts fast and alot so management looks the other way - little do they know that word on the street is stay away because of cheryl.  ask for anyone else but cheryl although you will still hear her drama throughout the shop!will management ever wake up to this girl!!!!"
thanks glenda. i went to another loaion before and was not happy. i did try again here. i was not greeted at 1st but the glenda quickly noticed i was a client not just coming to sit in the waiting area. she was woman of few word (fine with me) she clean up my original style and i was on my way in 30 mins tops. pros- not crowdeddidn't push me to by productsconshair was on the floorone employee was clearly socializing.not enough change in the cash register eventhough chase is inthe same strip mall (3 doors over).
"lady asked me about the hair cut that i need , i told her will need to cut it short and make sure all side are equal and if needed to cut little shorter we can. she told me no if you decided to cut more after what i do i will charge you another $16.50 for another hair cut , because that takes time and she don't have time for that .i was like really ? she was so rude .i'll never go there again thanks for the terrible experience"
"i went for a haircut in november, right before thanksgiving.  there was a temp working, and she did a terrible job with my hair (e.g., uneven cuts), which i didn't notice until the next day.  (i was in a hurry and didn't have my glasses on.)  the next day, i went back; the manager fixed the cut free of charge.  i went back again today; i received another uneven cut.  in addition, the person cutting my hair kept mumbling under her breath, as if i were doing her a great disservice by asking for a simple cut.  when she was done, she did not ask whether the cut was ok.  she simply walked to the register and began the check-out process.  i've learned my lesson: you get what you pay for."
"i dropped in while my boyfriend and i were out walking the dog. galena is lovely, and she did a wonderful job with my hair. i will definitely go back!"
"do not go here - i have been the victim of 2 of the worst haircuts of my life. tonight my butchers name was stephanie; a cold-hearted, unemotional, ruthless killer of good hair and style. from the moment she sat me down i could see the callus in her eyes and while i sat there hoping for the best; alas, i got her worst. she mercilessly chopped and snipped her way into the #1 spot of my all time worst haircuts. not only did she leave me with a faux widows peak, as shown in the attached image, but when asked as to how this could have happened she merely replied with malice in her heart ""it'll grow back"". to which i replied, "" i will be back here, nevermore""."
unbelievably bad haircut from this place.  i've ended up with this uneven and inadvertent anti-mullet that i never asked for.  my usual place was closed and i needed a haircut now im contemplating getting a buzz cut to cover up the damage from supercuts.
"i don't get it. every time i go it's a 30+ minute wait. the haircuts are okay. the price are moderate. but i don't have an hour to wait for a hair cut. and when you say there's two people ahead of me, don't bump my spot back. you lost another customer today."
"first of all make your appointment online with the app it will get you in sooner. i have received many skilled, thoughtful cuts from daisy. i get the same style every time and i get compliments so for a decent haircut i recommend supercuts."
samantha did a great and fast job. prices are very cheap and she got the job done well. she was very honest by telling me what she could and couldn't do. worked out fine and i'm happy with the results :)
i have been a customer for 17 years (used to be borics back when). samantha has been my stylist for about the last 5 years.  she has such talent she could work in a trendy upscale salon but she said she likes her customers & is happy here-lucky for me & her other regulars! sam gets busy on weekends but is worth the wait (she never rushes which i appreciate as i wouldn't want someone rushing my cut). i have also had good experience with galina & gladys who have worked here for years.
"awful awful awful!!walk-ins are not welcome!!they say they don't take appointments, walk in and wait over an hour and a half and still people walking in front of you"
"if you come to this supercuts, ask for samantha. she'd the only capable person there. otherwise, be warned - check pics to see what the ""stylist"" did to my 9 year old."
"haircut was actually really good. i gave specific instructions and they followed exactly what i wanted. i asked for an upper lip wax which left me with hair on my lip. the technician went over the entire lip in one strip, rather than two or more. so she did not follow the arch of the lip leaving me with lots of hair that i saw later when i got home. i suppose they aren't exactly known for their waxing services though. but it would be nice to have it done properly."
this place was really okay as borics before it was acquired by supercuts. since it became supercuts it has been staffed by employees that don't have any skills whatsoever. after my visit last week i will never come here again. buyer beware.
"i have seen galina many times - she is very precise and takes her time,in a good way.;  just saw samantha - she is also excellent; i would recommend both of them!"
"received a very bad haircut from an incredibly unprofessional haircutter who lacked any integrity or pride in her work.  didn't ask me how i wore my hair.   i asked for short and professional and received a buzz cut that made me look like a tennis ball.  no style at all.  not even close.  after she had ""finished"" i pointed out several places where she'd missed spots.   the manager then cut my hair for 5 more minutes and apologized.  never offered a refund.  instead offered a coupon for a free haircut next time.  i will not be returning.    my favorite exchange:me:  ""you didn't ask me how i wore my hair.""cutter: ""well, we have a lot of regulars here and we already know how they wear their hair.""me:  ""do you know how ridiculous that response is?""  i've had many great haircuts at places like supercuts, fantastic sams, great clips, etc.  this place just employs a person who doesn't care at all, is in the wrong profession, and has a manager that doesn't oversee the work being produced by her employees.  bottom line:  the haircut was $11.  you get what you pay for with this place."
"save yourself the hassle and do not go here. i made the mistake of running in yesterday for a quick cut and the stylist (hate to even call her that) had no idea what she was doing. when asking how short i wanted, she actually cut it short to show me. um, yea - we're still discussing here. thankfully it was underneath so it doesn't show but who does that? also my hair looks totally unstyled - just a blunt cut because, obviously, she doesn't know how to do any better. my husband could have done a better job! stay away!!! i wish i did."
"as a working professional, i feel like i'm supposed to drop $40-60 on every haircut. but i don't because i really love galena and samantha at this location (the other hairdressers seem friendly and popular, too, but i've never had them cut my hair). both women take their time and understand how to deal with my fine, very straight hair that shows every cut. i'm a big fan! the only downside is the wait on weekends, but that's not surprising."
"sam is excellent! i think she is also the manager at this location.had to wait 30 mins, but it was worth. will definitely go again."
"i normally don't go to supercuts, but i was in desperate need of a haircut and didn't have time to make an appointment elsewhere so i decided to give it a try, i paid about $15, and got one of my favorite haircuts! unfortunately, i don't remember the stylist's name, but i will be coming back."
"the power of yelp.  after my regular hair specialist at a competing chain left unannounced, i decided to check yelp for somewhere near the loop.  i found this location in river north, a little further than i wanted but i didn't mind for the right experience.  well, thanks to yelp, i found out about ana.  she is first and foremost a consummate professional.  she's great at her job, at communicating, at giving suggestions, about remembering her customers and their nuances, and in addition to that she's just a kind and caring person.  full disclaimer, ana has transferred to the loop location at the thompson center, but this location is still very nice and in fact one of her own family members is still here.  i highly recommend this location and highly recommend ana."
come here not expecting much but get the best hair cut ever!!! veronica are the best she fast efficient and make me look real cute thankyou!!!
"i recently cut all my dreadlocks off. i came here because it was close to where i had an appointment. friendly and courteous staff, i signed in and had to wait only 5 minutes. she trimmed my new short do in minutes & cleaned it up nicely. all for just 11 dollars!"
"i called my mother on facetime and first thing she yelled ""who are you??""  she couldn't recognize me with a newly established beard and fluffy disheveled hair.  so i decided it's time to take care of the aesthetic department of my head. in general, if you're not going to a fancy event, would you feel like spending too much money on cutting hair!. so i looked up supercuts because i had a great experience with them in other states. i read the reviews about this location and they were extremely bipolar. either the best experience or a lady who she said they cut her ear. or another who found this place too shady and cheap for her. this location is across the street from the magnificent mike whole foods on huron st in case you got lost. michigan ave was insanely crowded on the black friday. it was such a nice stroll over here. i talked to ana over the phone, she said walk-in is welcome. when seated, rose took excellent care of my head. she was very smooth and experienced. we had a great chat. we talked about taquitos and mole. she gave me an order to try a taqueria she loves. my head looked great and i was happy after rose did her job. then i had a head wash/massage. omg! it felt crazy good!i definitely recommend the head wash and shampooed head massage here. although i gave a generous tip, but i guess this experience was worth more. i read that ana and veronica are awesome here. but i already hired rose."
"i've had one good and one mediocre cut. not a ton of barbers in the area, so this works if you don't want to travel. go in with specific instructions and you'll be just fine."
"so i go to a lot of great clips/super cuts, so my review is based on similar comparisons. this place just isn't as good as the others. my hair dresser wasn't very friendly and didn't really do a great job. i'm not all that thrilled with my cut, but it's not awful (i asked for a trim and the front piece to be angled...nothing fancy!) the prices are hard to beat, but i'll definitely walk the extra few minutes next time to try out the great clips."
"i am writing to compliment andrew, my regular stylist at this location in chicago. he is always very cordial and professional in providing me with excellent customer service, giving me great haircuts and beard/mustache trims according to my specific requests.andrew is an asset to supercuts in general, this location and to all the customers he serves.matt hauman"
"shout out to michelle for a great cut. i was in the city on business and needed a quick cut and style. she did a great job of layering my hair and listened & cut carefully to make sure it was just like i wanted. all the customers coming in and out seemed like regulars, and the staff greeted them by name. happy place with a friendly staff."
i love this place.  i have been a customer of armando for more years than i care to admit.  he never misses a beat & the shop runs flawlessly.  always upbeat & professional -yet fun staff.  definitely recommend this supercuts location.
"i was looking for a new salon so i stopped into supercuts to see what they had to offer.  i was greeted with smiles and people willing to help me, including the owner armando.  i wasn't planning on getting a hair cut that night, but when they said they could get me in right away, i decided to try it.  i believe my hair was cut my nora (but i might be mistaken by her name!).  i was so thrilled with the cut and i've received so many compliments on it already.  it's a few blocks away from my apartment, which is extremely convenient and the price is just right.  living so close to michigan ave and the gold coast, it's nice to be able to get a haircut without having to spend an arm and a leg.  i will be going back!"
"great place to get the style you want in an affordable way, the staff are up to date with the latest and greats trends. i normally have trouble someone who can work with curly hair, i was very happy with my cut and style when i left. highly recommend!"
"terrible, really bad experince, i won't come back even if they will offer me free hair cut for life.i made a mistake that i step into this place, i got hair cut by lilly medina. she is not hair stylist and not even close to. bad bad don't go."
"consistently terrible - these people are garbage at cutting hair and even worse at customer service (and also super shady!). 1st time i was here, the woman cut my ear which was exquisitely painful. the manager came by and declared that i was not bleeding (lie) and then at the end, gave me a bandaid (why would you do that unless i was bleeding???). i thought it was a freak occurrence and came back again for convenience. hair cut ended above the chin (not what i asked for) and they deny doing anything wrong. they never admit to the mistakes they make and will charge you if you ask them to fix it. my hair looks like a mess. i asked for thinning and i ended up with an asymmetrical cut with lots of frays - it looks like a nightmare. avoid at all costs. this is a lesson in giving 2nd chances."
"you might ask , why the hell is this guy giving 5 stars to a hair cut place?well i will tell you why.i have gone here on and off for a few years. sometimes i go to someone name veronica who is very efficient and fast. but what i do is i call and tell them i will be there in half and hour. then when i go in, i get my hair cut done within 5 minutes of me being there.in the maybe 10-15 times i have been here i cant say that i have been here for over 25 minutes. that is very efficient and they care about your time.its not by appointment only but it does not hurt to call before"
"the worst haircut ever. avoid at all costs. have used this place because it is close to mhome. the last cut the worst. they do not speak fluent english. so they cut as they want. never again will i fall for the close and cheap.no one in the area goes here leaves a good review, they depend on tourists, or anyone only needing a nimber 2 shave."
"it has been hard finding a reliable place downtown that gives a good haircut at a reasonable price. i tried this supercuts which is a couple blocks from where i live. it turns out that one of my old stylists, lilliam, is working there and she always gave me a great haircut. i went to her for several months but due to some scheduling conflicts of my own, she was not there one night and i got my hair cut by sandra. she gave me an amazing haircut and probably the best shampoo i have ever had. i mostly see sandra now (because she is there in the evenings) and could not be happier. both sandra and lilliam are terrific stylists and i would recommend either one. thank you sandra and lilliam for the best cuts in chicago!"
"usually i pay 50-60 for a haircut and for a trim, not necessary. i walked in after work about 430, got right in. they trimmed my hair dry, which i've never had done before and was a little nervous about especially because i have curly hair. in and out in 10 minutes and staff were very nice. will be coming back for sure."
"i go to this location as this is closest to me and i only need trim for my hair and not any special style/cut. i usually see hair stylist anna - she is very nice, does the job well and is courteous to clients. the receptionists though whoever is at front desk except the hair stylist herself are all very rude. the older looking stylists who try to act as the manager not sure if the is actually the manager is utter mannerless always carry that attitude on her god knows for what. may be cz i dont see her and always wait for someone else? if you only care for your stylists and getting your job done this is a place but if you are looking for anything like customer service its a big no no. those stars only for stylist and lost starts for management for being consistently terrible at being courteous to clients"
i went to see chrissy after a disastrous color by another salon nearly ruined my hair.  i initially saw her for a haircut and her cut and blow-dry were so fabulous i went back to her the next day for a color re-do and have been going to her ever since. she highlights my very long hair and doesn't seem bothered that i have a lot of it. her color always turns out so natural and my hair is in the best condition it's ever been in. her blow-dry and style is incredible. the best i've ever had.
"i started here after my italian barber left the country without informing me. supercuts was almost across the street so i decided to try it. my first appointment was with ana and i lucked out. she does a great job and has been cutting my hair ever since. the price is about half of what i'd been paying before for the same quality. i use the app for appointments and occasionally have to wait because ana is so popular, but it's never long and worth it."
updated review: the front desk girl just called me back and yolanda now has an appointment and is able to fit me in. i'm a returning customer after all!yes yolanda is amazing but too bad the girls who schedule can't seem to remember when she works! i called yesterday at 10:30 to schedule an appointment and the girl told me to call back at 11:00. when i did the next girl said she wasn't working that day. she told me to call back the next day at 11:00. when i did that the girl said that she had come in at 10:00 and was now completely booked with no availability.i cannot wait any longer to cut my hair and will be going to another salon from now on.
"terri did a fantastic job on my sons hair. he has course, heavy, thick hair and curly to boot! she did exactly what i wanted, no hassle. we were going to the boardroom and weren't quite happy. word of mouth brought me here."
be sure to get a name if you call ahead and make an appointment bc chances are someone will screw up and even though you made a reservation 30 mins prior ( as instructed) you will come and be put at the back of the line.   not even sure getting a name will really help though?!?  maybe it's a bad place for a girls haircut?  seems like everyone can do men but maybe only some can do women and that's why they just put another guy in front of me? $54 for shampoo ($9) cut ($19) blow ($25). hmmm
"horrible experience here! i decided to come here because it was very affordable ($16.95 for a haircut), and i just needed a trim. boy was that a mistake...i did the check in on the website to get a spot in line before you arrive. it worked great, and i only had to wait about 5 minutes once i arrived. the lady cutting my hair was quite rude from the beginning. she told me i need to wear leave in conditioner all the time and was annoyed i didn't have it in my hair. i said i didn't need a hair wash which she seemed bothered by as well. she took a total of 5 minutes to cut my hair. 5 minutes!!! she said the left side was already shorter than the right side so it didn't need to be cut. the whole point of getting my haircut was to get rid of the split ends everywhere, so i didn't understand her point. also my last haircut was at an upscale salon in nashville so i know for a fact both sides are equal. i left very unsatisfied with the haircut and will have to go elsewhere to have it fixed."
terrible haircut. the person cutting my hair had no idea what she was doing and went to get help from another employee only after she butchered my hair.
great service! always do a quick job and do it very well. i've never been able to make appointments so i don't understand the bad reviews concerning a non existent appointment system. sounds like over privileged complaining to me.
"this has been bugging me for a long time but today was the last straw. supercuts doesn't honor appointments! today i called ahead and put my name on the list for a set time that they agreed to, then i showed up and they said that i'd be behind all 8 people in the waiting room. i clarified that she was viewing me as a scheduled haircut at this certain time, and she confirmed, so i walked out. she was not understanding but frankly she's probably confused about her store's policy to accept scheduled appointments and then put these people behind walk-ins. it's gotten to be so frustrating, just please tell me that this time won't work if you can't get me in within 10 minutes of my scheduled time, i'd rather choose a later time then show up and wait!!!"
"yolanda does an incredible job. i'm here temporarily and received a hair cut from her about a month ago, when i came in conversation picked up like it never dropped off. she remembered who i was and what i was doing in dallas. it's customer service like that, that is unique. not to mention she does an incredible job"
"i have had 3 hair cuts here so far. i'm leaving 2 stars for the first 2 hair cuts. (looking back after writting this, my hair cut just now was god awful, i can't bring myself to leave 2 stars)i just got the absolutely worst experience i've ever had getting my hair cut. i was in and out in like 15 minutes she took a #2 or #3 to the sides and back after i asked for a #4. it's way to short and instead of blending it looks like she took a bowl and a razor to the back of my head! no gradual blend nothing just a strait line then your into hair, i could have done the back of my own head better with a piece of glass and a mirror! this was terrible and no one would look me in the eye on my way out. she didn't ask how i wanted the back and just jumped in with the ""#4"" and cut a strait fucking line. and it was too late  she knew she screwed up and i wouldn't dare let that but her try to fix it. she didn't even get the top back where i had specifically asked for it! i didn't want that butcher touching me anymore after she screwed up the back and sides that bad then says ""done!"" yup i'm done! if i had her do what i had wanted i bet i would have ended up with a shaved line through my head and her looking dumber then usual while trying to explain how that was on purpose. my hair has been thinner since my cancer treatments and it really shows when its butchered like this. inconsistent, terrible job, i through down my money and kept more change then i ever have from a hair cut and ran out of there! i have never left a hair cut feeling this low. if you get your hair cut here ask for the german lady, she is kind and polite and cuts hair like she cares what you look like. she deserves 5 stars. she did my last cut here and i loved it. my hair looked good and thicker after! so i came back but they gave me to a cutter today instead of a hair dresser and now i'm writing a review considering wearing a hat in 100degree texas summer..."
"i understand this is a drop in kind of place and if you do that, it probably gets the job done. but i've been getting my color done there done there for about 6 months because it's the only place open on sunday's. it is always a comedy of errors. you have to call ahead and every time it takes a minimum of 5-8 minutes while everyone that works there shouts back and forth about it. for some reason they have to ask every stylist of they ""have time to do a color today"".   i know because they have no idea how to use the hold function. on the few times they do use hold, the person always picks up like a new call. it takes about 1 hour tops as i only get my roots done but they can't do it within 3 hours of closing?  i always overtip and am very friendly thinking maybe they will remember me and not go through the whole ordeal again next time but nothing works. i hate dealing with them- and look forward to finding another place that fits my schedule. only go there if you have no other options. price is okay but for mediocre color."
get yolanda to cut your hair. she's terrific. you will have to call ahead and have them put your name on a list. (she's that popular.)
"the haircut i received was average. i have really long hair and the stylist spent like five minutes on it. that said, it was okay. the real problem was the dreadful service. the stylists took at least two other people before me who had clearly come in after me and didn't have appointments. completely ridiculous! since i was the only person in the waiting room who wasn't a white male, i have a feeling it had something to do with my race and/or sex. avoid this salon and their prejudices!"
"took my daughter there for a haircut - it was ok, but she asked for layers and the girl cut it straight across and she asked to have it blow dried which costs $40!!!  she didn't know to ask  how much it would cost first, but $40 for a blow dry - they should have warned us!  not going back here!"
"this review is based on my only time at supercuts...i usually spend a lot more than what they here charge at a higher end salon.  i wanted to chop my hair off as a spur of the moment decision, and thanks to their online check-in i was able to see how long the expected wait would be so i didn't have to waste time waiting there.  i got to the location a few minutes prior to my estimated check in time but was greeted and helped immediately.  i had a picture of what i was going for and even though the cut wasn't exactly like the picture, i like it better than the picture i showed her.  when she finished she asked if i would like anything changed, and she touched up part of it perfectly (it's like she read my mind).  i'm not going to lie, i was scared to go as short as the cut is (and was probably in shock at first) but she did an amazing job and i can't believe how inexpensive it was.  one thing that is probably common knowledge to others but i didn't know is that everything is a la carte - the price is for the haircut only, and if you want it washed or blow-dried afterwards, it is extra.  one of my favorite haircuts to date."
"walked in and was taken immediately!! quick cheap awesome cut! i noticed a really nice of hair products line up in an eye catching display with prices very reasonable! i think the woman who cut my hair is tam. very sweet, smiley and funny. she was gracious and skilled. thank you!"
"i stopped in this place last night....at 15 minutes til close....i was met with great hospitality by the manager.  usually when i go to these ""franchise cuts"" places i am met with apprehension because of the texture of my hair and the definition in my cut.well, the manager was super nice and accomodating.  she made me feel like an old friend.  first, she knew it would be more than 15 minutes, no frustration.  second, she went ober everything in detail before cutting.  she made sure she had a understanding.  ran it back to me like she was taking my order (i.e. ok, let me make sure i have this right, you want......).  third, she understood my misinterpretation and mis-understainding of ""hair talk"".  we worked by talking, pointing out.  she got it, all of it!  fourth, she made small suggestions of inexpensive tools to get hair magic! like how to get color out without damaging my hair for $5 total.  wowzers....lastly, she didnt do a full cut so she was able to give me a discounted rate!!!  to top off an already good experience.there was another lady ckeaning the entire time so the shop was well kept.  product displayed nicely, sinks clean.i was leery because of past experiences with these kind of places, but she definitely deserves a gold star.  i left her a nice tip!  not to mention, she was pregnant, so i can imagine she is evem nicer when her harmones aint going crazy!!  i think her name was yesenia.  not 100 percent certain, but she is the manager."
my boyfriend's haircut came out look more uneven than when he went in....hair around the neck area was left untouched and not trimmed...not coming back.
came here today because it was closer to me than my usual marsh and forest spot (love those ladies!) the store was empty but the two ladies made me wait twenty minutes until they were done curling eachothers hair. worst customer service .
i got my hair cut here three times. it wasn't horrible as i am pretty specific with what i want and most of it is just guard work. the staff is always really nice though. it's usually pretty empty here not too much of a wait but they don't seem to be able to keep employees here not sure why.cheap. quick. decent hair cuts. what more can you ask for from a super cuts. i will probably be back.
"yeah you don't get the luxury of a high end salon but if you want a quick cut, in and out sort of deal, this is it.  no product up sells, no frills, just a plain old haircut.  the girl i end up going to is super friendly and easy to talk to.  she gives down to earth suggestions on hair care instead of pushing products on me, and she cuts my hair so well.  i know it's just a trim but i'm no stranger to crooked hair cuts.  plus it's so cheap i just can't resist.  i know these establishments are just considered a ""chop house"", but if you're not into paying $80 for a cut, this is a steal."
"as far as hair cuts go this place rocks!now i am not particular at all about my hair, (like seriously not at all)so when i go in i tell them ""just clean it up"", or ""a little off the top""; i know sometimes i am going to leave with a ""high & tight"" and sometimes a nice cleaned up look. that being said , after coming here for ten years! i love this shop, they are fast and they listen and they always make sure i look professional when i am on the way out! great staff and and super cuts!keep it up, see yal next time"
to the little young lady who runs the register. please chew your food before you come out from the back to speak to me. that was so gross. also i could not understand one word that the asian lady said who cut my hair.
did exactly what i wanted in a timely manner! great job lindsay! thank you so much i'll be back!
can get a pretty good haircut here for not too much money.  you get in and out pretty quick and good thing is not lot of picky women in here with lot of hair and lot of demands from the stylists. mostly guys go here and just want a good quick haircut without a lot of fussing.... the prices reflect that.
the wait was non-existence and my stylist was nice and professional.  it did not take her long to cut my hair so i was pretty much in and out.  she did miss a few spots though thus explains the 4 out of 5 stars.  i will return as they are close by and i rather not pay 20 + just to shave my head...
just when you find someone you like they quit. never a line though and the receptionist is nice.
"that transformation though!! lol finally got my unruly long hair chopped off and i couldn't be happier with the result! trista is amazing at what she does and the place was super nice and clean! i usually hate going to salons because i get very socially anxious, but i didn't feel that way at all here! everyone was so professional and i knew i'd be in good hands with trista, so i felt very comfortable. 10 out of 10 would recommend!"
"showed up during open hours, door locked. stylist inside on phone, with a person on their chair. didn't open door or even acknowledge i was there. no explanation."
"i love this place. the customer service is amazing, the quality of cuts is the top, and the convenience of the mobile check in is super!i can't gush enough about the stylists either! they are so warm and friendly and i left with a beautiful cut and style! i will definitely be back!"
love the stylists here. all very friendly. needed help with hair products and showed me exactly what i needed!
this is the first time i have ever come into an empty store for a haircut with my son and asked to come back in 2 hours. mind you the store was empty.  i said i was unable to and he asked me why not.  strangest experience!  the haircut itself was good and efficient.  we left and the store was still empty.  guess that should have been a clue that they have poor customer service and nobody wants to get a haircut here.
"the haircut itself was completely fine, but there was only one worker when we came on a monday around 5 pm. she was cutting one persons hair, another was waiting for color to set, and she seemed frazzled that my husband and i came in since someone else had an appointment for 10-15 minutes from  then. she seemed nice, but we did feel slightly uncomfortable, almost like we were adding to her stress. about 10 minutes later a second worker appeared, and we were both done with the simple haircuts after 40-50 minutes, but it was just a slightly odd experience,"
"shea is a godsend. i can't say enough good things about him! i've had my hair cut at numerous upscale salons, and have never been as pleased with the outcome as i am when he does my hair. some how he manages feminine but edgy cuts on me everytime, and it's always something different. i won't go anywhere else. thanks shea!"
i have just been to super cuts for blow outs recently and love them. they make me look great for a lower price than any dry bar. i have had my hair done by a few different people and they have all done a great job. i don't know what they do but my blowouts last for days when they do it. very much worth the money. i love the products they use- nothing too smelly or heavy. heads up- they have a lunch hour rush so plan accordingly. you can call ahead and get on the list.
"they have barbers/stylists for 'ethnic' hair too.  all i wanted was a basic boot camp cut.  the young lady had me in and out in five minutes.  for some reason, even as a child, i have always disliked the barbershop experience, whereas i know others love it.  so this was perfect for me.  however, if you want to sit up and bs for hours, this probably isn't what you're looking for."
i moved to plano from florida and i am so happy that i found  a great salon. i love my stylist as he is patient and really listens every time as to how i want my hair done. great place.
"i came in to see wayne for a blowout, and i had a wonderful experience! not only did he give me an awesome head massage at the bowl, but a voluminous blowout to go with :) he is very professional and personable! i highly recommend coming here and seeing him! ask for wayne!"
"this store used to be really great but has gone significantly downhill in the last year. i recently went in to get my eyebrows waxed. while the staff was generally friendly, the woman who did my eyebrows made them uneven and left many areas unwaxed/cleaned. i'm not sure if she realized it, but the wax she was using was not even heated, which is why it wasn't working very well. she claimed my eyebrows were like they came out to begin with but i've been getting them done for 12 years and have never once had this sort of problem. instead of not charging me because i calmly expressed that i was unhappy with the product, i was only given a 50 percent discount."
"i had my hair cut here last week.  when i washed it i found one side was longer than the other.  i called and found out the schedule of the man that cut my hair.  i went back today and he said, ""it's the same on both sides.""  i asked the second employee who said, ""maybe it's a little longer.""  i left and on impulse went into a second supercuts on beltline and marsh.  kathryn heard my story, agreed one side was definitely longer and said, ""sit down, i'll fix it.""  she did a great job.  i will return to this salon in the future.  the attitude at preston and park was unfriendly - there was only one other male customer.  last time i go there."
"it's really difficult to find hair salons that are affordable, with stylists who know what they're doing and actually listen to you. usually, i find you can expect to pay a ton of money for a really great cut, so this place was a pleasant surprise.i've been to several supercuts in the area and this location is by far the best. there was no wait at all. elizabeth cut my hair today and she was awesome. she listened to me when i told her the type of cut i wanted and she took her time to do the right job. she made sure she blew my hair out and didn't leave me with a bunch of wet hair all over my clothes. most places are so quick to get you in an out they don't bother with the extras. i'm extremely pleased with the cut i received here and will definitely go back again to maintain the style. a+++ all around!"
"i don't get my haircut nearly as regularly as a gal should, maybe. but recently, my hair decided it wanted to grow out just as terribly as possible.   i went ahead and downloaded the app in order to check in online ahead of time. i'm glad i did because it does seem to assist the staff versus calling ahead or walking in. the reason behind this is it sounds as though they are a bit short staffed right now. every time someone called in to inquire on wait times or to put their name down on the list, there was no receptionist to handle those calls. the stylists had to pause in the middle of their respective cuts multiple times due to high call volumes. i'm by no means upset, but just recommending for their sanity (and yours), i do think it's preferred to check in online. i did so maybe 30 minutes ahead of time and only had to wait about ten minutes or so. now - as for the actual 'do - i've gotta say, bless molly. the first (nice) lady who was going to cut my hair took one look and said molly would be better suited to handle my locks. ha! i didn't take offense as i knew it was a wreck, and i wanted someone who felt confident in getting it back into shape. molly took her time (but not excessively) in making sure everything got back to even and healthy and fabulous. she was a great conversationalist but didn't chat my ear off either. all in all, she was professional, kind, and knew exactly what she was doing. she may be my new girl going forward! i will be back."
"new to the dallas area and didn't know it would be so hard to find a salon open on a monday! after making quite a few calls and no one picking up or most of them being by appointment only i found this place, decided to give it a try and sooo glad i did! aurora did an amazing job! i came in for a cut and style and she did awesome! she even recommended some awesome products to keep my blonde hair looking healthy! she took her time and really listened to what i wanted!! thank you again!"
"i'm here on business from pa. i desperately needed something done with my hair. i took the chance on going to this salon. gabby was my stylist and she was fantastic! she offered me a stack of magazines to occupy my time while she completely highlighted my hair. she was very professional, and when she was unsure if i needed toned or not she made sure to ask advice from another stylist. i greatly appreciate that! my hair turned out great! she even taught me a trick to curl my hair with my straightener! i would definitely return to her if i ever end up back in this area!"
"maria does a fantastic job.  i highly recommend this place, as the employees are friendly and professional!  a+++"
"never again! wanted to give 1 star but 2 stars for the history i have had with this place.i have been regular here since 2009 when i came to dallas.most of the girls are good but they keep changing.but my fav since i found out this place was mayra! she is the best! probably one of the best i have ever come across!  apparently she has become the store manager now!last couple of my visits has not gone well! her attitude has changed completely. not sure if its trump magic! lol.i am not white. south east asian (indian).1) last to last time i went with on call reservation, waited 20-30 min for my turn with her. when she got free she called someone else and left me out. when i asked her she said "" oh i thought its the other sam, i need to go for lunch after this so come back after 1 hour! i thought..might be mistake. went to next available person and got my hair done.2) last time did a online appointment so that i select her name and there is no confusion. went there and checked, other girl confirmed i am next for mayra. waited 20 min. some guy walked in and checked in. 5 min later she got free, and called that guy ahead of me. i was stunned!..did not know how to react. thankfully the other girl realized what has happened and told her i have been waiting for her. the other guy was not even seated yet..he was just getting ready.her response: ""well ..the system did not tell her i was waiting on her..if you can wait""i was like..#######!not sure if indian are not good at tips ..but i used to as i liked her work.anyways...i said thank-you and walked out! :-)will cut my hair myself with trimmer but ..never again here! :-)"
i have a crazy anxiety about finding a new salon stylist for my haircuts. i trusted the smiling face (gabby) that greeted me when i nervously walked in. gabby gave the best haircut i've had literally in many years. took her time and made sure she was doing what i had asked. top notch stylist. i even asked when i left if she ever planning on leaving there because i'd finally found someone i'm comfortable with. she said she had no plans to leave. very happy i went to supercuts!
gabby can grab my curly hair and make it right! it's always nice knowing that you don't have to cringe around a pair of scissors about to attack the out of control hair on your head.  i'm always confident that she's going to tame my hair and make it look great!
cecilia and gabby were awesome the customer service was beyond satisfactory they girls were as nice as could be and i got exactly what i wanted done to my hair they've made a repeat customer outta me
"cecilia and nancy are both awesome, i had my haircut with nancy today she is nice and did a great job. nice clean and friendly environment. would recommend this place to give it a try ."
"i've been going here for 7 or 8 years, and generally got a decent haircut. sometimes it has been good and a few times it was barely good but acceptable. one person did a good job always and i started going to her every time and was very happy. she left and i made a reservation with ""next available"". a couple times i came in for a cut and even with the appointment, the wait was longer than i could handle, and that was understood and ok. i came back another day. last time i had an appointment and walked in a few minutes before it. the stylist was telling a lady that there was one person ahead of her as i walked in, and she asked if i called ahead and i said i did and gave her my name. the other lady had taken a seat to wait. the stylist then walked over to her and said she was ready for her, to which the lady was surprised as she had just been told of a short wait. then she told me it would be about 20 minutes. so i didn't have 20 minutes to wait to get started and i left and won't be back. i'm polite, friendly, and i tip well (usually $5 on a $17 cut), but i'm done with this place."
"i told her to give me the ronaldo #5starservice thanks cici! she took her time and did it right, all smiles at supercuts!"
"just got a cut here . larissa cut my hair, and she nailed it!!! she is easy to talk to, listened to what i wanted, and delivered on a great hair cut, which everyone wants...the staff there is friendly, great, and welcoming. i haven't had a bad hair cut yet. finally found a place that is worth going to over and over again!"
not even 1 star. i waited for more than 45 mins even after checking in online. they do not even bother to check appointments in system and give preference to their existing customers. same happened with another lady who was sitting there for 1 hour and she left without haircut. they may be good if you are existing customer but not for new customers. it was my first and last time.
top hairstylist is mayra. totally recommend her. if she is not available you can ask for miriam or vanessa.
"what i like about this place is that the location is great and the staff is too. its a very busy location, so their will be a wait. which is okay if you have the time, cause there is a starbucks close by so you can grab yourself a nice cold ice macchiato to ease the wait pain. there is one stylist that i have learn to love, larissia. she does an amazing job every time, i have yet to be dissatisfied. with her clippers at hand and a fierce attitude, shes always cuts my hair with a twinkle in her eye and makes sure my hair is exactly what i asked for. ill be coming back, thanks!!"
maribel was great. she has been cutting hair for 12+ yrs and did awesome with clippers and scissors. i will be coming back to have her cut my hair again.
first time at supercuts and it was great.  i had no wait time and the stylist was great for being very new. i advised stacey to please take her time and not to feel rushed in anyway.  she showed great confidence in her cutting and will improve with tenure.  i advised her that i will be back as she did well.  great hire supercuts!!
nancy was awesome and gave wonderful hair cut along with a very relaxing head massage. highly recommended!! go for her !!
i checked in & waited 30 minutes & i noticed         people just walking in & being taken in ahead of me pretty lousy place to be ati am not coming to this place ever & will talk to several of my friends & family about my experience
"marlon did an outstanding job on my hair, which is a big compliment taking into consideration my hair is awful! marlon is a very pleasant and talented  young man! finally found my favorite hair technician.  thanks marlon!!!ted"
"simply awesome.   very clean salon, friendly and helpful staff, on time appointments and abdel is just outstanding.  i met him at the smu location and have been following him since!! kudos supercuts !!"
i had a great experience getting my haircut here.. i asked for long layers & face framing layers as well as about 4 inches off my very long hair.. karina did a fantastic job & i'm being pleased with outcome! she listened to exactly what i wanted & also gave me great advice when i asked her about the hairstyle i wanted.. she was very friendly & made me feel at ease.. also i came in during the last hour they were open & never did i feel rushed or my haircut feel rushed..i highly recommend this location..
"finally found a great place to get my hair done!! thank you beverly, you made my day!"
this is my second supercuts experience and first at this location. wow! this location is nicely decorated inside (modern feel) and natalie was awesome. at 11am on a weekday there were a few people already waiting for a cut so i am very thankful for the online check-in.  i see why this place is so popular and plan on returning!
"tl;dr version;great place. def worth more than the $16 spent. long version;although supercuts has a reputation for being a cheap place, this location is great. the stylists are super friendly & talented. i hadn't had a haircut i liked in years until i came here. 100% more than worth it."
"i've been going to this location for several years now. the staff is always friendly and the space is always clean and well maintained. several stylists have cut my hair, and each time i've been pleased with the results. abdel has cut my hair the last 6 or 7 times. he has many years of experience in the business and it shows. no worries when i use him -   just sit back, relax, and let him do his magic."
i travel extensively hard to find people who can keep my young guy haircut intact on this old guy. glad i stopped in here .. erin was very cool.. perfect in fact!! definite recommend..
"great experience.. i always concern about the waiting time when i go get a hair cut.. i recently moved to dallas area and googled saloons around me.. beside that the store was clean and shiny, smells good, nice music,have magazines and sport channel on... the receptionist told me that estimated waiting time will be around 20 mins and i literally waited for 20 mins then abdel took care of me.. i enjoyed the conversation with him and was the best hair cut i ever had for 16 dollars only!!! second time i went there.. i requested abdel again and had the same experience... thank you super cuts for having such service for that price.. i would absolutely recommend any one looking for a good service with affordable price to try them out.."
great place for a great price. natalie gave me a great haircut and was very nice. my hair is curly and not easy to handle but i love what she did. i showed her a picture and she did her magic. i will definitely be going back.
"this place is phenomenal! home away from home 100%! my husband and i absolutely refuse to take our hair business anywhere else! the stylist are extremely upbeat with warm and welcoming professionalism. all though they do perfect with making sure you end up with exactly the hair style you envisioned, if not better, it is definitely the staff that make this location so top notch. abdel particularly has been taking care of us for the past year now and we keep forgetting just that...only 1 year...i swear it feels like he has been a close friend of ours for decades! that's how comfortable he makes you feel as soon as you walk through the door! i never have to tell him how i want my cut and he never has to ask me. i love it! he cuts our hair exactly the way we want it and provides top notch hospitality at the same time! he creates a close relationship with from what i have noticed all of his clientele in turn treating us all like family instead of just paying customers! i have no idea how we would make it if it were not for abdel and his expert skills of hair styling and customer service. thank you so much abdel and the rest of the staff at this location for making us feel like nothing less than vip with every visit! thank you abdel!"
"tl;dr - go to abdel and everything will be fine!this supercuts is great. the manager, abdel adawi, has been cutting my hair for over 10 years now. he has a dedicated following of customers, some of whom have been going to see him longer than me. i've seen him with plenty of loyal female customers, but he has even more male customers who have followed him religiously from his previous supercuts location on hillcrest by smu, and who will wait patiently for an hour for him even though other stylists are open & available. i'm sure the other stylists are great, they are always friendly, the store is always clean & comfortable, but at the end of the day i'm there for abdel - all around great guy, very professional, and always gets my hair right every time!pro tip: call ahead, because abdel almost always has a waiting list!"
hit or miss. prepared to be lied to your face about the wait time. i called in thinking someone would be available upon arrival. so i get there and there is a 10 minute wait time.  so i say ok that's not too bad. i wait for 30 minutes while the employees are getting coffee and taking their sweet time. they than ask me are you waiting for someone? how can you not be pissed at that.
"this supercuts location is a great place to get your haircut with professional services with lower prices. (i love a good deal.) i request abdel to cut my hair because he takes his time, puts effort into styling it and always asks to make sure i am completely satisfied with my cut and style. he is very professional, friendly, and most of all, does a great job cutting hair. even when abdel isn't available, the other stylists do a great job styling my hair. they are always friendly, honest, and thorough in cutting and styling hair. i have yet to walk away from the place with any kind of regrets. i highly recommend this place. hope this helps!"
"it's not often one finds excellent work along with excellent service but the staff at supercuts (preston and beltline) managed to do it. i couldn't not be happier with the way they cut my hair and the staff is always friendly, always providing service with a smile on their face. thank you supercuts.joe munoz"
"i've been going to see yessica at this location for over a year. her work is fantastic. all of the people i've interacted with at this store have been incredibly professional and helpful. i think everyone there is genuinely happy, which makes all the difference. they work well as a team and the store is clean and tidy. because they are so well run and the stylists are good, the traffic here is pretty high, so don't be disappointed if you have to wait 15 or 30 minutes."
jordan was amazing! fast and friendly. clean facility. would totally go back to her and this location!
"great place! friendly people, i liked the men treatment very much the girl took her time and massage my head for at least 15 min i will defiantly come again oh and i only paid $20 included tipi feel i am lucky i found this place"
i luv yessica my little stylist xoxo
i'm not sure why this place is rated this low. other than maybe rival businesses playing games. i've always been treated quite well and have been more than satisfied with my haircut. everytime. especially for the price you pay! would give ten stars
"ash is great! fun personality and i love my haircut! the shop is clean and everyone is friendly. fast wait times, i happened to come in during a busy time and still didn't wait long."
"would definitely give this place 0 stars if i could. sure, i don't have a go to salon and usually just go the place that's convenient but never in my 26 years of living have i ever gotten a cut so bad. decided to try this place out because it close by and my father recommended it.i usually do a comb-over with faded sides. i go in telling the hair stylist what i tell everyone. a 1 on the sides faded / trim the top, i do a comb-over. guy says ""okay gotcha!""i trustfully take off my glasses and go blind for the next 15 minutes.- he starts fading the sides without clipping the top up. that's fine, maybe a different technique. but then i start feeling him going at it near the top of my head, left side (i don't feel the same thing happening on my right side). note, during this time he is very talkative and jolly.- proceeds to start cutting the top of my hair. at this point i see an outline of my bangs and it is definitely missing a chunk on my left side.- he then goes quiet as he starts working frantically on my left side. almost as if he did something wrong.- puts on glasses and what do i see? he cut off at least 5 inches of the 6 inches i had. i have about 1 inch of hair. i have one hair style and that is spiky. i can't comb over. there's no part. the fade line is slanted. oh and there's hair missing on my left side. everything is lopsided. all in all. 0/5 would not go back."
"i had the worst hair cut i've ever gotten at this facility. i wasn't going to write a review because these things happen and it's just part of life. but just a moment ago my wife looks at the back of my head and says ""your hair line on your neck is crooked"" looked in the mirror and sure enough was, that was the last straw. the lady cutting my hair seemed like she a super basic knowledge and didn't care one bit. wish i could get my money back, not worth the frustration."
"i love this place. the customer service is amazing, the quality of cuts is the top, and the convenience of the mobile check in is super!i can't gush enough about the stylists either! they are so warm and friendly and sooooo sweet! i left with a beautiful cut! i will definitely be back! thanks for taking care of my curls!"
i love this location! everyone greated me as soon as i came in and i got exactly what i asked for.
went there to get shampoo and blow dry plus trim. an indian lady asked me how i would like my hair blow dryed? im confused....how many ways are there to blow dry hair. there was an asian lady standing next to her who was no help. had to leave and try to find another place.
ashley gave me and my daughter great hair cuts.  will be going back.
"extremely unprofessional staff. they never greet the client. staff has often been rude in the past. not sure why. staff fight for clients, in front of the clients. i am a professional as well, and would never do that to my clients. extremely disappointed. won't visit again."
went in for a trim.  told sima multiple times just a trim do not want short!  she does not listen and cuts it short.   by the tim she has taken the first snip it is to late for us to fix we have to go with the short.  if you go there do not use sima.  we will never go there again.
a head-turning haircut with on-line check-in? is this affiliated with the tony cvs health brand.why this supercuts is a winner:nothing can make a meh day into i have arrived day faster than a great haircut at a fair and reasonable price. remember to tip generously!the stylist are intuitive and do not require a lot of coaching. you will look twenty years younger in minutes.sparkling clean surfaces and floors with no antiseptic smells.it does not rely on cheap gimmicks to get customers in the door. dallas and collin county citizens have high standards and they are delivered on here. flying someone soon? get a haircut here and the flight crew will bump you into first class because you look dallas.ethic hair invites what we all know - more options for a saucy and sexy new look.all age groups including those memory challenged are welcomed and treated with respect and honor here. not to mention a flattering or updated haircut.comfortable waiting areas with new magazines!great air conditioning and abundant parking!saturday and sunday hours respect your busy work week.the general vibe is comfort meets style meets skilled staff!
"cut my hair way shorter then what i asked for. guys beware. i repeatedly said about 5 times to leave it long on top, but in the end everything was short and way out of style. that's why i cut my own hair for 5+ years. i never trusted anyone to do it right but i gave in this time and i sorely regret it. also, i was sat in a previous client's chair without any sort of cleaning of the chair or floor around it. yuck! besides that, the actual haircut was what i disliked. $20 for a bad haircut is a little too pricey."
first time going to supercuts. on-line check-in was easy. got an excellent haircut from rodney.
"second time i called for appt second time i was told 20 minutes, second time i waited over an hour and still no haircut. awful"
came into town for a business trip and i needed a trim to be presentable the next day.  rodney was incredibly professional and sharp with his scissors.  thank you for the great haircut.
lisa & rodney are by far the best two people there!
excellent hair cut!  great conversation!! reasonable prices!!!
"if your wanting great service, ask for rodney!  always offers a smile and great conversation.  and once he starts with your cut, you're done in no time.  he has cut my hair for two yrs now.  my wife went to try him out and he now cuts her hair regularly.  incredible guy.  ask for him, you won't regret it!"
"took guy and jason's advice and went to see rodney for a haircut.  they were right, rodney is great!!!  my hair hasn't looked this good in a very long time.   he listened to what i wanted and cut it perfectly.  thanks rodney!!!"
"i went in with long hair to get a short cut. i took photos and told them how 2 years ago i'd paid $75 for the awfulest haircut i've ever had. i left super cuts with the second ""awfulest"". i took photos that should have made it easy to imitate the cut i wanted.  jenny told me she could do that cut.  i am blind without my glasses, as in i see a blob in the mirror that might be me or might be a tree.  when  i expressed trepidation about the cut after she'd finished and i put on my glasses, jenny told me, ""that style too young (pointing to my phone with  the photo of the haircut i wanted) - you need more ....mature"". i paid and left.  i was too upset to speak. i was afraid i'd cry if i spoke.  stupid me was so stunned i even left a tip. do not ever ever use a stylist who with thinks they know better and cuts what they want without telling you first. jenny was that butcher. my hair today, the next morning, has chunks in it that look as if she cut it with a dull sheep shears. i will not go back to get it fixed because its already shorter than i asked for. any shorter and it will be a mans' cut. so i'm back to crappy hair until this mess grows out enough to try again to find a decent stylist.  i'm sick of bad hair and sick of egotistical professionals."
"based on the actual hair cuts we received i would rate this place a 5 star.   i can't give it that rating because of how dirty the store was.  they actually sat my son in a chair that still had hair from their previous client all over the it and the floor.  considering that this is a major violation and extremely unsanitary, i will never go back!"
"when my roommate said he needed a haircut, i didn't think twice about recommending this place.  when he looked it up online, he expressed concerns about going here, as the reviews for this establishment were very poor.  i was very surprised to hear this, so i decided to write my own review.i've been frequenting this establishment for over a year now and have had nothing but good experiences here.  mayra is my favorite hairdresser, but all of the ladies i've seen here are very competent.  every time i've been here, i've been greeted when i entered the store, all of the ladies are very polite and have a professional demeanor.  i normally go on sundays, first thing in the morning, so the wait time has been minimal.  my normal routine is to get my hair washed, conditioned, cut, blow dried, and flat ironed.  this runs about $25.  i find this a reasonable price to pay to walk out of there with great looking hair.the store is clean, friendly atmosphere.  if you are looking for a place to offer you wine and rub your feet while you wait, this is not the place for you.  if you want a great haircut for a reasonable price, ask for mayra.  you can thank me later."
busy place with only 1 barber. web check in is a good idea. staff always look frustrated and in rush to serve everyone. will get a good haircut if the barber is in good mood. not my preferred place if i need to be get ready for some important appointment or anniversary
love this salon! the stylists are so upbeat and always know how to take good care of my hair! they are definitely hair doctors that know their products! best hair cut and will always return!
had a good experience. my hair was tended by jasmine and she cut my hair exactly the way i wanted it to be cut.
"terrible experience.  unprofessional personnel, old dirty appearance, unsanitary people and equipment.  i'm a guy w the easiest haircut in world. somehow this girl screwed it up. haven't had a haircut this bad in 10 years. she was eating when i came in and screamed from the back of the empty store she was coming. took about 10 minutes to get to me. didn't see her wash her hands. she used clippers that actually pulled my hair when she started using them. after my reaction she changed the head saying the earlier customer complained but she thought it was just him. she trimmed high over my ears. looks terrible."
"well, i was contacted by someone from supercuts after my previous review. i was asked for my home address so that i could be refunded for my haircut. it has been well over a month (my hair finally grew back) and i have not received any refund. i'm not surprised at all. if you need a inexpensive haircut close by, go to nidia at great clips in irving. she made me presentable after i was butchered at supercuts."
wow. i went in for a haircut. there was 1 other man waiting for his. the lady said i needed an appointment because there was a 4 hour wait! there was 1 person in the whole place!  0 stars!
"had haircut before and it was okay so i tried again and they do unfinished hair cut, right and left side cut looks different, new hair artist most times i guess that's how corporate hair salon works. wouldn't recommend."
"you can't beat a good haircut at their price.i've been going here for years, and with the exception of one lady, all of the stylists are fantastic.be sure to put their number in your cell phone so you can call ahead and get on the list in the event there's a wait!"
just stopped in for hair gel waited 20 minutes. employees have no idea what they are talking about or doing. go to floyds!
i've been to this location before and the haircut it's been ok but this last time i left in complete disbelieve! how can a hairstylist that basically just came out of school (july 2015) cannot cut straight lines. hairstylist contreras may seem shy and soft spoken but seriously the job you did on my trim on the back is awful. the sides instead of going down straight are v-shaped with an abnormally high squared back. please avoid this location or getting your haircut by ms. contreras! totally disappointed
"i started a new job recently and i am in a part of town that i am not yet familiar with.  and to be honest, there's not much around here to choose from.  i've been so busy, and in desperate need of a wig-splitin', that i figured i would knock out a haircut on my lunch break.  the partial disclaimer is that i am used to a mid-higher end barber shop/hair styling facility...but i don't think my standards are too high for some supercuts.  i walk in at 1:30 pm and i am the only customer.  the person who would be soon cutting my hair, turns around from a chair in the very back of the shop, cell phone in hand, and says ""umm hello? you getting a haircut?"" there was no wait of course.  i was escorted to a chair where even in the awkward semi-silence, i had to ask how they were doing, hows your day going etc.  c'mon customer service 101.  i tell the ""stylist"" how i would like my hair cut and the response was a ""gross face"" followed by ""wow, okay do you always do it like that?!""  yes.  the paying customer currently in your chair is saying yes.  they start the process and begin complaining about how dead the shop has been.  how they have been the only one working today and i was the 2nd haircut they have done.  fast-forwarding.  the work was halfway done, zero desire to give me the style i was looking for, and when i began asking for adjustments, the attitude was back.  long story short, its not a terrible haircut, but it's not 100% what i asked for, and i wasn't pleased.  the persons attitude was my main issue, like i was putting them out to do their job...that they spent the majority of the time complaining about.  if you are in an absolute pinch, and don't mind not getting exactly what you want (if you don't care - hair is hair) then rock on.  i just won't be coming back.  the haircut will cost you $12 but the attitude from the staff is free."
"took my son here today.  there were 3 ladies working and they all had a scowl on their face and were very unhappy and unfriendly.  when we walked in, we were not even greeted -- one stylist just sighed and asked if we had an appointment.  i told her we didn't, and asked how long of a wait.  she said 15-20 minutes.  well, the appointments started coming in, and we were pushed back over and over.  i get it, they had appointments - i even asked if i should leave and come back - over an hour later, we finally had my son in the stylist's chair.  she did not cut his hair the way i explained and even showed her.  there is no way i'll ever go back."
"although some of the staff were friendly it was a saturday afternoon and they were under staffed. the manager was obviously feeling the stress due to her attitude. absolutely no skill by the stylists when all we wanted was a simple wash and blow dry. doesn't even deserve a 1 star, bad tools and techniques, wasted money"
the worst haircut ever. very uneven. not even sure how these people got hired!! never go!
"average prices ($13 for a basic ""supercut""), but mine was done just the way i like it. staff was fairly friendly as well, plus i walked in and there wasn't much of a wait."
"without a doubt the worst haircut i have ever gotten. i went in for a simple ""buzz"" cut. five on top, and a one on the sides.... how on earth can you mess up a haircut like that? one side of my head was longer than the top, and the other side was almost bald. she tried to tell me that gel would fix it. wtf? and if the haircut wasn't bad enough, this lady kept asking me to take her 300 lbs friend on a date, the whole ordeal was extremely uncomfortable. do not go to this place."
what a dump!!! never seen a supercuts in such a nice neighborhood this filthy and run down?!?! staff was lazier and dumber than the toothless wonders who clean horse shit out of barnyards. 2 stars for cutting swiftly on my infant baby's first haircut. minus 2 stars for butchering his bangs worse than an 80's bowl cut.
"nightmare! the black girl doesn't know how to cut hair! if she were working at a black shop she would get booted out immediately. she cant cut! took a big chunk of my hair like she were practicing on raggedy ann!! supercuts you want to hire ""experienced"" stylists!!!!!!!!!!! not anyone from the street. you wont be getting my business ever again!"
"misty did a great job cutting my hair. she took a few minutes extra to make sure it was perfect. thanks, misty, i'll be back."
place is a joke when it comes to management and customer service.  will never come back here and would highly discourage others with so many other options in the area.apparently the manager left the floor with three customers waiting to discuss some training with another employee. will never come back here and would highly discourage others with so many other options in the area.
"i feel like i should make two reviews. one has a 2 star because i went in wanting no more than 2 inches off my hair and left with my hair completely uneven and cut about 4 inches off. i got home and thought to myself, well it's just hair and maybe i can go back and have someone fix it... i would give amanda 5 stars!!! i'm so glad i went back! thank you amanda for fixing my hair! i truly appreciate that you took the time to fix my hair and make sure that it was done properly. i really appreciate it.  if you go in to get a trim, be sure to only go to amanda! she is so sweet and really knows how to take her time. thank you again amanda!"
they are all very friendly and the service is great. cookie does a great job of cutting my hair every time.
"came and saw josie spencer to cut my sons hair and she did an amazing job! super friendly, funny and kept us laughing!"
"unfortunately, i did not have a good experience in the way of my hair cut, for starter's i asked her to cut 1 inch only and she cut like 4 inches off my hair if not more.  the cut was not what i expected for a layered look and she did not want to do anything further of the services i asked stating to save myself the money that it would be too expensive for me. and this was on week day where it's not that busy at all with nobody waiting for her. so, as for my hair i am totally dissatisfied with it but my husband did have a good experience with her and his cut look's great! but this review is based on my experience but i still wanted to balance it out a bit stating his experience. i would say for a man's cut she's great but possibly not for a women's hair cut ""again"" based on my experience. maybe other people have had good experiences but i sure didn't. now, there is a lady that work's there that goes by the name of cookie that does a great job on my husband and has on me in the past. i was just determining my decision to go with this other lady by my husband's hair cut, which was great and her availability at the time i walked in. i would say if you're a man definitely go with this lady and if you're not go with cookie or go somewhere else. i was very dissatisfied with my experience this go around. i will never cut my hair with anyone but cookie there."
i went there at 8:10 on 12/20 /16 for a haircut. my haircut consists of a number half of the clippers all over not real difficult to be honest with you i really go so they can make my neck square and everything look ok. they still struggle with that. it shouldn't be too hard to give me my hot towel but is the third time i having got it i'm done. bye-bye..give this place another chance once again i do not get my hot towel i should not have to ask for it i don't believe. you promote hot towels with the haircut i'm getting a damn haircut why do i have to ask for a hot towel.
we had the pleasure of getting our sons hair cut by josie! she did a wonderful job and was very outgoing. he was comfortable from the start and did very well with her! the salon was very clean and organized too!
"this is the best supercuts i've ever been to, i'll never go any place else. josie i believe that's her name was awesome!!!!!!!!!  josie was great, awesome and happy to assist me. this was my first time, i'll never go any place else, i'll only see josie, she's awesome!!!! great spirit, personal and very attentive to my needs, thank you for being awesome, great atmosphere, kind, gentle and just all around a great place.  thank you for bringing josie in she has really made a great impression on my family and i!!!!! we've found our stylist!!!!!"
"i just got the fiercest haircut from jason! i've had a picture that we have been using as a guide for the past few months. yesterday we pulled the trigger and added all of the detailed razor design lines and he even bleached and toned it for me. bar none, one of the best cuts i've ever had!"
visited this supercuts twice in the last month.  stylist josie did a great job cutting my hair.  she is very personable and takes her time.  she makes sure that the customer is taken care of!  i will be back!!  highly recommend this store!  manager jason is awesome too!!
i love coming to supercuts !!! the atmosphere is always awesome and i will always request josie  she always cuts and styles my hair super!!!
"supercuts casa linda has always been our go to for a good and inexpensive haircut without a long wait.  about 3 weeks ago went in, got in quickly but while waiting was entertained by a boy about 2 getting his hair cut and didn't want to.  the lady was so patient, nice to him, making him laugh through it and was able to continue with out him noticing or fussing.  it was then our turn and we got her also.  josie is her name, with a huge smile, out going, gentle and listens to what you want done.  i guess she is new to this location or we just haven't had her before but what a great addition to the neighborhood supercuts!"
"went in to take my toddler to get a hair cut. we waited for about 30 minutes to be seen. you could tell that no one wanted to cut my son's hair because he's young. there were like 3 stylists hanging around doing nothing. they had clean stations and everything and they were just chatting amongst each other. finally one of the male stylists called him back and you could tell by his demeanor that he really didn't want to cut my son's hair. my son started crying when he was sat in the chair. he wasn't being unruly or trying to get out of the chair, he was just crying a little. the stylist then said that he wouldn't cut my son's hair if it wasn't safe or dangerous to do so. that was a total cop-out. yes my son was crying but he wasn't wailing or being crazy or anything. he's a toddler who is not yet used to hair cuts so of course he's going to cry a little, plus the guy was a stranger. what do you expect? i don't doubt my son got an ugly vibe from him because i know i did. i won't be coming back here again. they should have advised us from the beginning that they wouldn't see him if he cried, instead of making me wait for 30 minutes. a total waste of time. if you have young children, don't bother coming here. they are not helpful, caring, nor considerate."
"shelley was awesome. i was ""that guy"" and walked in 15 minutes before closing time on a wednesday night and she graciously took care of me. didn't complain or roll her eyes- probably because she saw how bad i needed a haircut! i will definitely be back. thanks supercuts."
"great experience today with miranda. she listened to what i wanted and followed through *exactly* and with expert precision ... plus, she's just plain fun to be around. :)follow up: people! you gotta hear this! ever since i got this cut ^ i've had women *and* men tell me how smokin' hot it is. it's truly the best cut i've ever had ... and i've been to some 'spensive salons. dallas, anyone??? [i once paid a staggering $100 for a cut a jose eber... ugh!]"
"this place really deserves a zero for the racist way my son was treated.  from the moment i walked in, it was obvious they did not want to cut my son's hair.  he's 12, and they made a joke about him needing a wax and shave (assumedly insinuating that he was very hairy). the stylist and clerk rolled their eyes multiple times. the stylist intentionally called wrong names when we were the only people waiting in the waiting area.  after washing my son's hair, they did not spray a detangler into my son's obviously extremely curly hair.  we were told that we would be charged extra if the brush out took more than 15 minutes (which has not happened at any other store in this chain).  after rolling his eyes, he asked my son if he ever even brushes his own hair.  then, he handed my son the brush and told him to do it himself.  at that point, we left.  it was obvious that this stylist had minimal knowledge on working with hair in people of color.  and it was clear that he did not want to do it anyway.  the stylist was clearly happy that we were leaving.  i have been to multiple supercuts, and i have never had a problem before.  clearly, this is a personnel issue at this location."
"very clean place. walked right in, no wait. matthew was my stylist and i just asked him what he would like to do. ended up doing a high fade. came out looking amazing. much better than my self-done bathroom haircut. if you go in, make sure to ask for matthew. you won't be disappointed!"
"it seems as though all supercuts locations vary on service and quality. even when you've thought you've found the right location for you, they change things up with new people each time. therefore, i'm not nearly as impressed with supercuts as i once was. i don't think the hairstylists here are as knowledgeable as they could be. i was unable to get the haircut i had asked for twice now, even after showing the stylist a photo of what i wanted.this particular location seems to have a lot of stylists ""filling in"" from other locations. if you want just a trim, then this might be the place to go. if you want an actual style then i'd suggest going elsewhere."
"it took me hour and half to get the haircut. there was only one person working. ridiculous. very bad experience. 03/30/18(update): they have recently changed all the hairstylist and maybe the whole management is changed. now its more like getting a haircut from a $2 place. the hairstylist crystal is very unprofessional and rude. i miss ashley, she was the best. never coming back here.03/30/18(reply to debra)@debra - don't see an option to reply on your comment. the review on the 'wait' is not from today but i think a year ago when i originally posted the review. i came two weeks ago to get my son haircut and saw the unprofessionalism and thought maybe it's just once and i didn't post any review, but looking at your new team i don't see that changing. the standard has really went down and i was a regular customer here. i am pretty sure all the regulars feel the same as i do."
this place is down right awful. always has only 1 maybe 2 people working and i sadly learned they have no idea what they are doing. also they quoted we a 25 min wait and i had to wait over an hour. seriously save yourself some wasted money and time and go some where else.
"great service and great people every time i get blow outs, haircuts and color at this supercuts"
"same experience as the others- again tonight. i come here to get my sons haircut. 10 min wait turned into 25...and we have other places to be. hire more people, and those that care about customer service. going back to floyd's across street for better cut, service- worth a few extra bucks and not getting frustrated again."
we had a great experience of getting haircut for me by ashley and my son with jessica. they were very informational and did an awesome job on our hair cuts. we have been here many many times and love their service.
"hit or miss,  need to find me a decent barber shop.  some good stylists and some really bad ones.  long waits, fast food type feel."
"i had a haircut today at this location and it was a nightmare and if you are looking for a haircut i would highly recommend not to try this place and if you still wanna give it a try, make sure that you don't go for shelly lane. she was the worst and the most annoying hairstylist i have seen so far. the basic qualifications for hairstylist is to be knowledgeable about hair style, being patient with customers and not to be rude. unfortunately she has neither of these qualifications. if the management is reading this review, pls do yourself a favor by firing this lady and i bet that will improve your business.  thanks for reading my review!"
"i have never experienced anything like ashley getting her hands into my hair, thank goodness she had that hot towel ready for me when she got done!"
this is a great supercuts! elida did a great job on my boyfriends hair! we'll be coming back.
stupid online check-in. i'm one of 3 people in the waiting room with 6 employees cutting hair but they tell me it's 45 min wait because there are people who have an online check-in but are not here. so i have to sit here and wait for people who are not here. 0 stars.
"had a friend recommend bailey. i used web check in and specifically requested her. i got there a little early and was called quickly. the lady asked what i wanted and i explained i didn't like how chopped the back of my hair looked and i preferred that it was layered/tapered and i wasn't really sure what it was called but i explained i have thick hair and one length across looks terrible on me. we sat down, she starts cutting. then i noticed her picture said ""lisa"". she asked if i wanted it  blow dried, which i thought was included in the price because you can't tell how the cut looks until it's dry. anyway, i now have an awkward 12 year old's hair cut, all ready for picture day!"
"i went for a trim and a hair color.... i'm working on going from my natural brunette, (with the ends still dyed) to a more blond color.  got fit in pretty great, and the lady that worked on my hair was great and super funny.overall - great experience, friendly staff and a good price. i paid under $70 bucks for a cut and color - that doesn't happen in southern ca where i'm from!!"
"at least from my experience, the staff is super nice, and i get good haircuts for the price. it's my go-to hair salon."
"​this is by far my favorite supercuts and my go-to place for looking my best. as a hair salon, you can't find anything fancy but what you will find is a great value. typical haircuts are $16.95 and they do allow same day call ahead which is great considering we are all on some type of a schedule.  my only complaint is the parking situation as the lot is limited and i have to park literally around the corner and sometimes the walk can be a chore. despite that, no other complaints. if you do come, my favorite stylist are marisol or keith. they both are the best in my opinion."
"super busy location but really nice staff. parking is a little hard. reserve a hair cut spot online in advance. in case you don't tho, mostly men come here so the line moves quick. i am pleased with my cut! i even bought some great conditioner. will return!"
"after several months, i decided to return to this supercuts location.  the price has increased from $16.95 to $18.95, but the quality of the cut does not justify the price.i went through what i wanted, very simple trim my hair to sit at my shoulder, no layers, no texture, and thin my hair out a little bit to take off some of the weight.  there was cutting and more cutting and the mentioning of not being able to cut my hair on one side the same as the other.  i was a little worried on how my hair would look at the end, and it turns out i had every reason to be!  at the end of all the cutting, my hair was shorter than what i asked for (about an inch to inch and half above my shoulder).  i had specifically asked for shoulder length so i could still wear my hair up when i worked out.  there was no blow dry so i could see the full effect/end result of the haircut.  i was handed the mirror, shown short wet hair, and ushered to check out.  nothing i could do or say about the length because the hair was gone.  i went home to see the damage, a terrible, uneven cut, not the same length in places, uneven from one side of my face to the next, etc., etc.  it's pretty awful and humiliating knowing that i paid for this and i gave a $5 tip.  never again!!  i guess you get what you pay for, but nevertheless completely disappointing because this should have been a super simple haircut.  i will not be returning."
ask for mariselle. she did exactly what i asked. looks good! i also had a coupon which they gladly accepted with no hesitation.
"great service. great attitudes. great haircut. went in as a non-local, but was pleasantly surprised at how well i was treated."
"they overcharge! i got a root touch up that costs $40 at every other super cuts and they charged me $60! that's a big difference, and when i asked why, they said ""yah it's $60""um...that's not an answerthe root touch upwas good hence the 3 stars and not lower, but it wasn't any better than all the other root touch ups i have gotten at supercuts for $40i'll definitely go elsewhere in the future."
"so....i have been coming to this place since i was little....there were my experimental years, where i was trying out different places ...which always left me less than satisfied with my hair. then one day, i was like ""i'm going back to the last place that got my hair right"" and there you go....went back to my childhood neighborhood, a little farther than where i live now, but always worth it.    i have had a couple of different stylists over the years....and i feel like each one gets better. the last few times, i went with taylor g. and what an artist! i have a lot of really thick hair....but taylor has never complained ! ( people have complained all my life) ...i always go with a picture of what i want, and taylor always gets a feel for what i want, and asks me how i feel about the do every step of the way, to get it right. personalizes it to my own hair thickness/ shape/ tips ....i tell her what i like, and she works her magic! for the most part i trust all the stylists. i really recommend taylor ! plus theres restaurants nearby and a starbucks right next door!"
"i had never been to a supercuts before yesterday, but i didn't realize that their clientele are mostly men until i walked into the salon and the only women i saw were the stylists. i have very long hair and have very specific expectations for it, so i was a bit worried that i had made a mistake by looking for the best ""bang-for-your-buck"" deal. at this supercuts, the basic haircut is $16.95 and they take another two dollars off if you're a student! however, my fears were allayed after being greeted by molly, who was both entertaining and excellent. i told her what i wanted and she told me it would be no problem, immediately starting in on achieving my desired end result. i asked for her to reshape my layers, make the ""v-shape"" of my hair a bit more dramatic, and to get rid of all the dead ends. my hair really looked fantastic afterwards, i've gotten quite a few compliments in the past 24 hours since my haircut!molly was fun to talk to, hilarious, and knew what she was doing. i would highly suggest you go to her for your next haircut, i know i will be!"
"i came in for a haircut this morning. i'd had an amazing cut from mary before, and my boyfriend loves larry but has never had a bad cut here ever from anyone. i got a cut from an african american woman today who had the 1st station next to the check in/out spot near the door. i told her it had been 7 weeks since i had a cut. my hair had a long layered bob to the chin in front and stacked short layers in the back. i came out with bangs, which had not been part of my hair since mid 80s. what i did not realize while inside (due to my crying from bangs) that my front right side is also layered high, shortest layer in front right same as the short stacks in the back. my left side is completely different, which could be because she was trying to finish and get me out because i was just crying at that point. this is the absolute worst haircut i have ever had in my life. how can you give someone bangs they did not have before without saying something first??? this will take years to grow out and correct, plus i have to find someone to balance the sides out because having 2 sides different with this cut is like having only one eyebrow waxed half off and the other being unwaxed. i was not charged for the cut. but, they can't pay to get my hair back so i am stuck with hair i hate for a long time while it grows back."
i visited the supercuts centre on woodway square centre in houston.  this is the second time that there is no hot towel after a haircut. either the staff is ignoring it or the company is making fake claims !! i do not fancy a hot towel but what is promised should be delivered !!!
"i came here to get my haircut saved during my lunch break after the lady i first went to didn't do a very great job. i scheduled through their website and they were able to accommodate me immediately.  i paid $16 and some change and i was waiting to tip after the woman on the front desk scanned by card, but didn't ask for tip... so do they not do tips? anyway, the girl who did my hair was very nice, she kept a little bit of a conversation and tried to fix my hair as much as she could, which was definitely better than the first time. my haircut is more even but there were some things she didn't work on like the front of my hair, which i had to ask her to fix. she talked and acted like she knew what she was doing, and even taught me how to cut my bangs myself.the environment inside is lively, compared to other places that can be dull and quiet. everyone was nice and courteous."
i've never been one to schedule my hair appointments and like the convenience of just walking in. i have been here a few times and have always been satisfied. my hair is very long and thick and they take great care of it! my boyfriend also loves coming here. he made the mistake of going somewhere else and he had to come back here and get it fixed. lessons learned! the service is great and the prices are reasonable. however i would make a call ahead of time to see how busy they are especially if you hate waiting.
"honestly, i love this supercuts. i've lived in dallas for two years and it's the only place i've ever gotten my haircut since we moved here. granted, i'm a low-maintenance gal. i don't wear makeup, i own three pairs of shoes, and i don't like to spend more than $16 for a decent haircut. fortunately, i don't have to at this supercuts. sure, there are some flaws. they don't take appointments so wait times can be tough, but if you call ahead you can put your name on the list and they usually let you know exactly when you can come in to avoid a long wait. today i called at 11 and they told me that the next available time was 11:40. i put my name on the list, hung out at home for thirty minutes, arrived promptly at 11:40, and i was in the chair getting that black apron wrapped around my neck at 11:45. i don't think i've ever had the same stylist twice, but everyone i've had has been friendly and very good at what they do. i've never left this location unsatisfied with my cut. today i came in wanting a bit of a change from my regular straight, simple, just-past-the-shoulders hair. i showed mario a few pictures of what i was thinking of and he said it was no problem. he was meticulous and professional, and 45 minutes later i left with a short stacked bob, feeling light and awesome, all for only $16 plus tip. these guys know what they're doing, and it's a great place for a haircut."
the hair dressers are great but the company is a cheat. i had 2years worth of points accumulated that they nullified because i did not give them my phone no.
"i luv this place! the staff is amazing! please call ahead for an appointment or you will be waiting! the location is very popular and a secret gem! they are always willing to accommodate you and the staff is so welcoming! the location is super clean, in fact i'm here now and two of the employees are cleaning! i have my regular stylist, which i won't share her name, since i'm selfish and want to make sure she does not get a line of folks. but, honestly most of the staff here has great skills! i'm just super paranoid, since i have long virgin hair. i just don't let anyone touch my hair. the price is reasonable especially since i use to pay $50+ for a haircut!"
"i absolutely recommend this supercuts.  the front desk greeter is always friendly, and the stylists are just as nice.  in addition, i began frequenting this location not long after i underwent an organ transplantation, so i had to wear a mask to guard against germs and whatever airborne debris might be in the air.  i was treated no less than anyone else, despite wearing this odd-looking apparatus.  when i mentioned my situation to the various stylists, they were absolutely understanding.  in fact, one stylist even put into the notes in my profile that the cutting equipment be sterilized, due to my situation. five star treatment, for certain, and five star supercuts location."
"i have been going there for over 20 years and still have the same person cutting my hair.  i wait to get me hair cut until  bobby jones is available.  he is great, a real nice guy.  try him you will like him."
terrible experience. waited 40min after checking in w 3 ppl coming in after me getting a haircut prior to me. 2nd and last time i'll visit.
"very disappointed at lack of service. arrived, put in my name for a haircut & waited while 9 other people were taken ahead of me -- supposedly with appointments , which seems to defeat the purpose of the shop to begin with."
i always get my hair cuts from supercuts but as i was in downtown i wanted to try a different branch. i have a very long pretty hair and not many people like to experiment with that. my hair stylist at this place also was not ready to cut it short. i wanted bangs and she was not very happy about it. but i insisted and she gave me bangs and a layer cut. i have been getting so many compliments for this new hair style. i trued getting bangs before but it was never the same. i love my new hair style
"i've gotten inexplicably good haircuts and highlights at this location for the last two years.  before that, i patronized a number of small, independent salons throughout houston where i got surly service and bad haircuts, at a significant cost premium.also, wait time here is generally super short, and you don't need an appointment."
took my daughter to get a hair trim was charged an extra $10 for blow drying her wet hair. was not told a simple blow dry not even a blow out would be $10 and it's ever acceptable to let a 3 year old leave with dripping wet hair. i am so irritated. also the woman took a very long time and in the end when the hair was dry the back is uneven. i've been coming here to get my daughters hair cut and each time the hair trim was even and i was never left with my daughters hair wet out the door they always dried it.
"do not go here to get your hair styled! i came here on the morning of my birthday party and asked for simple loose curls. that's it. the stylist sprayed down each section of hair with hairspray and curled it tightly with a flat iron. you could hear the hair sizzle and singe. she assured me it was fine. by then end of it (she had me faced away from the mirror during the process) i had what resembled a tight curly perm. i seriously looked like a poodle. i was near tears as i expressed to her that this was nowhere close to the loose curls i asked for. the curls were hard and crunchy and she brushed them back out and tried again. my hair took so much damage and i ended up paying the $40 and leaving upset with messed up looking hair on the day of my birthday party, i had to clip it up. later on after washing out the hairspray, i could see how bad it was damaged in the process. my hair is thin and always has been, but used to be sleek and smooth. now i have insane breakage all the way up to the crown. this is going to take a long long time to repair. save your money and your hair, don't go!"
"place used to be good. guess all the good staff left. there is now just one main lady there, and she is rude and nasty. she rushes through your cut just to get through more customers. she told me she couldn't cut my son's hair a certain way because her fingers were too fat - what?!!! she said this after rushing through my other son's hair while being disgustingly gassy. then she nipped him and said he was moving. i was right next to him, he wasn't moving - he has been getting his hair cut for years and knows not to move. i just drive further away for better quality service not just in hair but in personnel."
i would have given 0 stars but i had to give something. this place is awful. i went there to get my hair cut and dyed for a birthday present. i had just had a baby and wanted to feel pretty again. i showed the girl what i wanted done and she just didn't care or something because she did something completely different. she butchered my hair and the color was off too. i have to let it grow out now. it is hideous! i started crying because i was so unhappy. i will never go there again. i even completed the survey after leaving a review on facebook and someone from the home office contacted me. she told me to call her but there was no way to contact her! the whole company is awful. i have told everyone i know about the horrible job she did on my hair!
"odd place. not sure exactly what is going on here. stylists are sitting around chatting and laughing while customers are just -- well, sitting around. seekingly takes forever to complete this one customer, possibly an hour or so. in the mean time, i can't tell -- are they ignoring us on purpose, as in, "" watch how we are blowing you off! ha-ha!"" or perhaps they are not not noticing the customers, and they forgot they are not just visiting with each other.does this place have an owner?this is not normal for a real business"
"they were understaffed for a saturday. miss shonte got my little guy in and out very quickly and did a great job cleaning up where i hacked into his hair. it was quick, affordable, and miss shonte will be seeing my little guy and my mister again."
consistently great hair cut by shonte & paige. they are always with happy smiles & friendliness to all clients.  and they keep a clean store salon.
"marsha is amazing! she calms me. i feared people to touch my hair! feared it i say! but marsha fixed a botched hair cut a while back and did a beautiful job. she put up with me and my emotions so i only go see her now! i know she sees me coming too ha ha but she's patient, so sweet and does a super fantastic job every time. i even got someone else to absolutely love her too today. soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo yall are missing out! for sure! ask for marsha. mmmmmmk!"
staff wasn't very friendly. i got a trim and when i got home i noticed a lot of hairs that were longer than the rest of my hair. my hair was pretty uneven so i had to chop off some strands to even it out. won't be going back. you get what you pay for.
"this would have been a much higher review before last night. i've been here half a dozen times and, before last night, gotten very nice haircuts. last night changed everything. i told rose to trim my hair 1/2 inch. i specifically said that i was fine with coming back later for another cut if it turned out  needed more. well, rose trimmed 1/2 inch off the bottom all right. then she proceeded to cut 2 to 3 inches off all my layers. the woman totally scalped me. dont let rose touch your hair."
"ask for marsha. i've never had a regular place to go and get a haircut until i walked in here one day and she helped me. since, i always call and make sure she's working before i come in."
"marsha is awesome!!! i had 2 diff people recommend her and to be honest, i'm not impressed by most hair stylists, especially ones from chain establishments. but marsha knows her stuff! i have thick hair, and love layers. she cuts it right every single time and is very affordable. can't go wrong with her"
"1st time customer of supercuts....i am a black women and didn't think they could pull off the hair cut, but i was blown away on how good my hair cut turn out....shonte was very nice she also taught me to maintain my style in between cuts."
this place is clean and the staff is well experienced and knowledgeable. i do not believe that you should have to pay $50 and up for a good hair cut and this place is proof of that. i will be back.
"i recenlty moved close to this location. i am very weary about who cuts my hair because i have been going to the same person for years before i came to this supercuts. my first time coming here i happened to get jennifer. as you can see from previous reviews that everyone has mentioned her and they are all right about her. she did a really great job and from then i would always get my haircut from her. other than that the store was well kept and everyone was friendly.i gave this location only 4 stars because i called this morning and found out that jennifer is not longer at this location. i am not sure who or where i am going to go now, but if anyone knows of another person at this location trustworthy please inform me. very disappointed that she is no longer there."
"i've been trying to grow out my hair forever, but my ends were so bad i was embarrassed to go out in public.  even though i have an amazing, reliable, long-term hair stylist in my life, i dared to just have someone trim my ends.  i stopped in on a saturday afternoon without an appointment and they were able to fit me in right away.  the girl who cut my hair was sweet, but i'm not really sure she knew what she was doing.  she sprayed my hair with a water bottle and then proceeded to trim my ends.  i think spraying it and not washing it may have been the issue since i walked in with hair that hadn't been washed since the previous day.  it looked ok when i left the salon, but when i went home and washed it/combed it out - i was literally in tears.  my hair was super choppy and uneven.  right away, i called my regular stylist and booked a repair cut.  the cut was cheap (i think only $16), but even that price was a rip-off considering i ended up having to spend extra time and money getting it fixed.  my stylist kept commenting about how crazy the cut was, and because it was so uneven, i ended up having to get at least another 1-2 inches trimmed.  so much for growing my hair out and just trimming the ends! :-( never going anywhere but my regular chick again!!"
"#supercutsbe prepared to have an extended wait especially,  if you have already put your name on the list in advance. my experience with this supercuts has also been when you call this location from management  stating "" i don't have time"" then abruptly disconnects from the call! better service at great clips at bunker hill.  i finally found former supercuts hairstylist, manuela lopez there! :-)#supercuts1106silberrdhoustontx77055#greatclips"
"when i walked in i spoke to the girl at the desk and let her know that i needed to get my haircut and asked if i may use the bathroom. when i came out of the bathroom i sat down and started to wait and then a lady who came in after i did... i watched her drive up, got service before i did (the hairdresser knew her by name) then when it was about to be my turn again, a family of six walked in and the guy hairdresser said that they had been in an hour before and they were next. what's so funny is their name was not in the book but yet he was going to put them in front of me as well. i am very sure that they knew each other and that is why they were being put in front of me. i guess the salon does not need new clients. i will never get my haircut at supercuts again"
"this review is just for abi. i have thick, curly hair and most stylists just want to chop it all off. abi looked at the picture i brought in. took the time to discuss exactly what i wanted. made a suggestion that she follow the same layers as pic, but not cut it as short as i wanted to be able to put it up still. she ended up cutting and layering it twice after i decided i wanted a little more off. looks like a $50+ haircut, but was only $20! will be asking for abi again!"
love my new hair (cut & dyed)! great customer service! they take time to meet your needs & understand what is best for you. i was happy with the result.they also recommended me with great hair treatment product :)
"i have gotten about 10 haircuts here and it's usually ok, but lately they have been super slow.  the last time i went i was there for about 1 hour and 45 minutes...they told me 30 mins. cut was average, not worth the wait."
i absolutely love my cut and color from here! i'm very picky but this supercuts outdid my expectations. this location also has excellent customer service. i'm a regular and i've never been disappointed!
"my son and i came on a friday morning and there was only one customer who was  just finishing up, so no waiting. jackie did my hair, working from a picture, and she showed me what she was going to do before she made the cuts. she suggested texturizing and also styled the front the way i wanted. i appreciate that they didn't pressure us into buying products for our hair, but simply had them on s shelf if you wanted some. all that and a good price - we'll be going back."
this place is wonderful! great customer service and affordable prices for the services they provide!
"brenda did an awesome job cutting our 14 year old son's hair.  he has a ""callic"" that he plays with to distraction.  she listened to what we needed and gave him a great cut that he can spike up!  he loves it!"
i've been coming here for over a year now. i'm a creature of habit but why mess with a good thing. nelis cuts my hair just like i always do and i always leave with a smile. keep it up.
so for some reason yelp removed my complaint but bottom line the manager screwed up my hair a while back and it still has not recovered. matt and jackie are gone so there is no point in even coming here anymore. plus this place is always dirty. i just got this unclean feeling last time i was here. just save your time and money and go to a place that actually cares and cleans their clippers once in a while................
i walked in for a blow dry & style and amelea was my hairstylist. i was very pleased with the service and she did an amazing job curling my hair. if you are in the area stop by to see her.
"this was my first haircut in houston, tx. i had previous good experience from supercuts so i decided to try this location. my hair stylist was maria which was very friendly and easy to talk to. i am very picky with my haircuts and not easy to please but maria did a great job. my hair looks great & i got exactly what i wanted. the price was  affordable $14.00 and they offer a deal which is get 10 haircuts and get 1 free card."
"they always give me a great haircut. very friendly and always do their best to make my experience great! not expensive and excellent service. also, get the tea tree experience! its very relaxing and its feels so good! i always get that after my haircut....."
"first time there, wasn't all that great. didn't like how the girl cut my hair. i had to wait about 30 minutes since i didn't have an appointment. shampoo/conditioner is 6 bucks. my total was around $20 and my hair is pretty long. won't be returning though."
"i drive all the way from baytown, tx just to have my hair cut at this salon! i met jennifer 3 years ago when i lived at sawyer heights lofts and stopped at this location to get my hair cut! even though i live in baytown now i still travel 30 minutes because of the quality and friendly customer service i receive at this supercuts!!!"
last time going to this location!! they obviously have people that don't know what they are doing! specifically showed them a picture of long layer hair cut and ended up getting a blunt straight shoulder cut!!!? did not catch the name of the person but he was a male.
"it's the best salon i've ever been to. they are very helpful and make you feel more like a friend instead of just a customer. jennifer is amazing at cut, style,  and color. i wouldn't go anywhere else."
"this is a typical supercuts. it's a typical hair cutting place. i've never had to wait long here, without it being obvious it was going to happen as the waiting area was packed. i've seen people go ahead before that had an appointment, but that's not shocking. all the ladies seem to do good work. i certainly am happy when i leave."
"they don't honor their own coupons!!!the haircuts are just ok . .. the service is, often, not even that. i live in the same zip code and get supercuts coupons in the mail.  i go, and present the coupon, they tell me they don't honor those!!!!  i live just blocks from them.  i could walk!!   what supercuts are they for???  i am done.  might be time to support the local economy, instead of the chain."
"worst barbershop i've ever been to. they said they don't have #3 clippers and just give everyone who asks a 3.5?? also the barber didn't listen to me 5 times during the haircut could, and cut way too short. couldn't blend the sides of my head with scissors as i asked for, and did a lob sided haircut overall. wouldn't recommend to anyone. to make it worse when i complained to the manager who was watching the whole haircut she didn't say sorry once and didn't accept that they did anything wrong. of course had to pay the full price never visit again"
remember one name tommie!! by far the best stylist i've ever had. i have been a client for almost 6 years now every two weeks i see her. she always have a wait but it is worth it. i've told her for years that company doesn't deserve her. i am one of those customers that know what i want and won't take anything less then that. she does a great job every time.
i have been going to this supercuts for over 3 years now. my normal stylist is alondra and she does great on men's haircuts and fades. i've used a few of the other staff while my stylist is on vacation and they are all very friendly. i love the staff and the hours. also a new thing they offer is for you to check in online from a mobile app so i normally check in while i'm on my way. i've seen plenty of families come through and i've never seen an unhappy customer. give it a try!
"don't even want to give my experience a one star. this lady butchered my hair. honestly the worst haircut i have ever received in my life. i don't know how i kept my cool, and most definitely don't understand how i still paid her!  she can't do good lines, she gave me a bald spot and tried telling me that's how my hair grew! her fade is horrible she made my experience traumatizing. don't waist your time,money, or hairline. sylvia will mess not only your hair up but your day!"
"do not go here. they utterly destroyed my hair. i went in for a simple trim of my shoulder-length hair, specified exactly what i wanted, and also specified exactly what i didn't want, just to make sure there was no misunderstanding. lady cutting my hair indicated she understood, then hacked it off exactly how i told her i did not want it done. and it was absurdly uneven, and i had to specifically tell her to even it out after she was done. it looked like a five-year-old had done it with a butcher knife. i left sobbing. this probably serves me right for going to supercuts in the first place when i actually cared how my hair turned out, but i figured it was safe enough since all i wanted was a very basic cut. this was clearly my mistake, as i could (and have!) literally done a better job cutting my own hair at home with a pair of sewing scissors. i will never go back here, and the only use i could possibly imagine anyone having for this place is to recommend it to their enemies as a practical joke.edit: just read a few of the other reviews, and it looks like it's one butcher who's ruining it for everyone. older african american lady was the one who obliterated my hair. she rushed it like mad, did a sloppy job, and i still want to cry."
"i cut my own hair for a decade.  i know - not terribly stylish of me, but a short buzz is pretty easy to do on your own.  i should have started coming here sooner.  it doesn't matter who i get, they always do a great job.  parking can be a pain, and there can be a wait right after work, but i don't want to go anywhere else."
"waste of time. called in the afternoon cause i wanted to get my hair colored as i had an event the next day to attend. was told they were open until 9pm and that i could come in anytime to get my hair colored. so i plan my evening accordingly as i had to be somewhere tonight at 9pm. come in at 8pm and am told that they close at 8:30 and the latest they do color is till 6:30... sounds to me like they don't care about getting business, whether new or a regular customer. this place has lost my business and i will never come back to supercuts. over priced anyway for their stuff."
"if i could i would give this place zero stars!! they have the worst customer service. they discriminate against customers. i brought my son in and it was clear each of the stylists kept ""conveniently"" bypassing him to take the next customer. we were waiting an hour and after they passed us over 5 times i asked them why we kept being skipped. they fumbled with their words said they made a mistake yet still took a different customer and told me to wait and it would be just a little longer! ridiculous... very rude! i will never go back!"
"i'd give this place 0 stars if it weren't for one of the stylists being nice, but this place has lost my business forever.  twice in a row i arrived well before their closing time and was told by the manager that they are closed.  meanwhile their light is on and door is unlocked and several still there.  i guess they'd rather go home early than make money!  never coming here again!!!"
"i've been coming here for about 2 years and my barber/stylist.. whatever you want to call him.. is awesome. his name is aj and when i first starting getting my hair cut with him, he definitely took the time to listen to what i wanted and worked with me throughout the cut. 2 years later he's still doing an awesome job. this supercuts has just been updated and it's pretty nice. all the employees are very nice, the store is clean, and it's in a convenient area."
waited 30 minutes and someone walked off the street went ahead of me for total 45 min wait . go at your own risk to be bunked. really bad manager! i was not the only one that walked out.
"i came to get my haircut with rita and she did a great job! having just moved here from laredo, i was afraid to come in with someone new. she was very knowledgeable and really made sure i felt comfortable with everything she was doing to my hair."
"holy cow, i must say, this is by far the worst haircut i've ever had. i am asian and only recently moved to houston. whenever i move to a new place, i usually have trouble finding barbers that know how to cut asian hair well. usually supercuts hasn't done well in past locations, but i decided to give them a chance. i asked for a simple trim: #3 in the back and sides, and just shorter in front. the back and sides look fine since using a buzzer with a predetermined # is pretty impossible to mess up. the front though looks like the lady put a rice bowl over my head and cut around it. i told her it looked horrid, and asked her to fix it. she kept making it worse, and eventually i just gave up. i will have to go to a different barber just to get this monstrosity fixed."
seriously 22 $ for a normal hair cut which just takes ur 3 min. not going back again.
"well run, friendly staff, consistently good cuts. aj is gone, so now i usually go to taro. he's always taken care of me all the way down to ear hair and eyebrow trims."
"i've been getting my hair cut at this super cuts for almost 2 years.  i have never had a bad experience.  all of the stylists do a  good job.  when possible, i have aj cut my hair.  he always does an amazing job.  i always say that i will call ahead and make sure he is there before going, but i don't simply because i trust everyone there.the salon interior was recently renovated due to the staff winning some kind of ""best salon"" award.  you can't beat it for $14.95!"
what and under rated gem! coya's abilities and professionalism made my day. everyone there is great. thank you for a consistent store and inviting atmosphere.
"just had the worst haircut here by far. i been coming here for the past couple of months. and i dont have a preference on who cuts my hair. but today this older african american ladie literally cut my hair in under 3 minutes. she rushed my hair cut so she can get the next guy, this lady next to me finishes her customer, and my stylist told her to ""clean your station before you take the next person"" and ""im buying time so i can get the next guy"". i feel so mad that i even gave her 2$ tips. this wasnt worth 15$, i can get this at a $5 mexican salon down the street. so pissed, i felt like a second class customer, as if im not as important as the next guy she was trying to get. he probably tips her big. but i dont care, im a customer as well."
"i walked in on a saturday afternoon and expected the wait to be long but i was seen within 10 minutes. i got helen who was super sweet and did exactly what i wanted. she also would check with me before she did any final cuts to ensure i liked what she was gonna do which i really appreciated! she was fast but efficient and did a great job, will definitely go back to this location."
gloria is the best hairdresser! don't go with anyone else!! make an online appointment if you don't want to wait too long.
"very impressed with the service provided by eunice! first the wait was not long, even though there were three people waiting. i had not cut my hair in a while and starting to look like a witch with long boring black hair. lol  so i requested layers. eunice walked me through the cut explaining how she was giving me vertical layers while keeping my length. cost $17 and coupons are available. i will definietely go back."
"it's a trap!the price makes it really appealing (it's so cheap), but there's no attention to detail. they just try to get you out as quickly as possible and don't seem to care about doing a good job."
"don't let eunice touch your hair. she needs to be fired! i asked for high and tight with finger length on top. a day later i wash my hair and its multiple lengths on top, very short in the middle."
the ladies here cut my hair very well. it's walking distance from my work and makes it convenient to go to during lunch
"i've been coming to this location for 8 yrs, it's never overly crowded and i've been using michelle and gloria for yrs. these ladies are awesome. they know exactly how i like my hair cut. look them up the next time you need a cut."
"i needed a haircut in a hurry for an interview and tried this place out since it's so close to home.  i setup an appointment online and showed to see there was only one stylist in the entire place.she performed a rush job on my cut and kept looking at her watch as if she had other things to do.   when i indicated i also needed her to wash my hair, she didn't seem pleased.   long story short and to no surprise, the hair cut was over done and uneven.    luckily, my hair grows fast so the damage was minimal but, this is a lesson learned that you get what you pay for."
"i had been needing to cut my hair for a while but just hadn't gotten around to it. i'd made an appointment earlier in the week for a ""fancy"" salon but when i arrived they hadn't officially confirmed my appointment. so a few days later i walked in here and had zero minutes wait time.a lovely lady named helen immediately helped me and did my hair. she listened to exactly what i asked - 6-8 inches off and layers - and did exactly that, while double checking what i wanted as we progressed on the process. what more could i ask for? she knew what she was doing and was professional. unlike some places that charge extra for longer hair it was a flat rate which i really appreciated also.if you want a good haircut of exactly what you want and aren't interested in all those fancy frills like ""free mimosas"" this place is great. they also didn't feel the need to force product on me which i also appreciate. go see helen! great experience!"
"been a regular since moving to houston 4 years ago, but this place has gone way downhill in the last few months.  all of the old stylists/barbers have left (not sure if it's a corporate policy change?), and the appointment system is suddenly jacked up (2 hr wait with an appointment!?! wtf).  expect a long wait for an even more mediocre haircut.  time to find a new shop..."
"i had several good experience with supercuts at different locations but this encounter was just bad. i usually go somewhere else but that place was closed on sunday so i had to resort to supercuts. how hard is it to cut a guys where with clippers and scissors. i got home and noticed that my sideburns were uneven between my right and left. there were portions of the top that were different length/ ignored. although the price was ok, i would rather spend a few extra dollars to get a good haircut then have to go back home and fix the problem myself."
"the people here are very friendly and know what they are doing. far better than tgf where i went before. also, you can make an appointment or checkin online. but even without that i never had to wait!i totally recommend this place!"
"the good reviews say it all. i was looking for a quick haircut and was far from my usual tgf -a mixed bag lately- and... sorry tgf but you've lost a customer. this supercuts is nice, clean, pleasant and, very important in montrose, provides easy parking. i had no wait late on a sunday afternoon and had the good fortune to be helped by eunes, who apart from doing a great job with my hair is also a great lady: experienced, professional and a joy to talk to! will definitely be back."
"i saw gloria and she was awesome. i am african american, have very thick coarse hair and a pixie cut (of all styles). she was personable, very skilled and gave me exactly what i wanted. the only reason i'm giving four stars instead of five is because of the wait (but to be fair, i didn't have an appointment) and she didn't use clippers to edge up the back. no worries, my hubby usually does that for me. i will be back for sure. solid cut and service"
"i have been getting my hair cut a the this location for several months now and have never been disappointed. they have an app,which allows you to check-in on your way so that you are not stuck waiting in a long line, which is a huge plus. it seems the busiest times are the afternoons and especially the weekend afternoons. the stylist have always given me a quality cut and a great price, so i will be back."
"so, i had to be somewhere after work so i decided to pack clothes for the gym before going out.  well it never fails, of course i forgot my running shoes and i had wore dress shoes to work. just great!!  lol well then i needed to kill time and i have been meaning to get a hair cut; therefore, the logically thing to do is go get a hair cut!!  i walked into this supercut and i was greet by melanie.  she asked for my name and email to put me on the waiting list.  then, i sat down and patiently waiting for two people in front of me to get a hair cut.  there were two cosmological there and it was actually pretty quick.  melanie was the next one free when it was my turn so she shampoo my hair and started making conversation with me.  it was kind of nice instead of just sitting there in silence.  after the shampoo, she walkede me to the station and asked how i'd like my hair cut.  i explained it to her and she did exactly that. before she started cutting she made sure of the length i wanted too.  overall, i had a great experience here and melanie was super nice, friendly, quick, and professional.  i would definitely go back for a hair cut if i was in the midtown area or after work! =)"
"this is the best place in midtown when you are looking for a good hair cut, but don't want to pay the same price as if you were buying a new car. jessica is fantastic! i have been going to her for the past five plus years and she always does a great job. she will cut her goad however you ask her her to and you never feel rushed or like she is too busy to take the time to do a good job on your. i wouldn't go anywhere ales. great location, good parking and if you call ahead you can usually get in and out in no time."
"got a really bad haircut here yesterday. couldn't have been worse. lady apologized after. have them a second star bc everyone is very nice. in short, nice ppl, crappy haircuts"
"first time i went to supercuts and my now new hairstylist javier rivera was amazing! great communication with me understood what i wanted and gave me tips and opinions that i love to hear through the process of cutting my hair. he was well groomed, clean and had a great appearance, which is a good plus to me! i will def be coming back again to him!"
friendly staff great cutreasonably pricedexcellent selection of productsno appointment needed
"marissa is terrific! she colored and highlighted my hair & a cut. she was right on with her suggestions. she listened to what i wanted & took her time cutting my hair. i loved my color, highlights and cut."
"on saturday, i made the mistake of getting a haircut at a salon closer to my home. again...big mistake....really nice person...bad hair cut. fortunately, glorious was working on sunday morning. i quickly made my way to her and she worked a miracle, as always!  i started going to  glorious over 8 years ago because it was convenient but now i have learned that convenience is not as important as quality, patience, style and experience.  i have learned my lesson. #supercutheights #glorious #4ever"
i have been seeing glorious here for many many years and she is just that- glorious!!!  i trust her because she has decades of experience and gives amazing service.  i recommend her highly!
"in the area and decided to try this supercuts rather than drive the few extra miles to my regular salon...big mistake!i explained that i only needed a shampoo and then a trim to get rid of split/dry ends. this was by far the quickest hair visit i have ever experienced. i found it convenient until i got home and realized it was because the stylist didn't pay attention and missed a bunch of hair!! i still had chunks of hair with split ends and ended up taking my kitchen scissors to trim it myself. who has time to go back and demand a fix?!?on another note, the way the stylists were chatting with each other was excessive and maybe that attributed to the lack of care in my haircut. also, the stylist stood at the register while i was paying which always makes me feel uncomfortable like they're waiting to see how much of a tip they get. will not go back."
i brought my daughter here and they upsold me without asking for my permission.  i looked up and my daughter was getting her hair washed...too late to say no.  it's too bad bc her tipn would have been well worth it if she had trimmed her hair we originally asked.
did not take direction and completely botched my boyfriend hair.  they cannot cut tapper fades. do not come here for a tapper fade.
"by far one of the worst haircuts i've ever had the displeasure of receiving. don't go!! save your money. have your wife, cousin, random stranger on the street cut your hair before you go here, you'll end up with a better trim. so here is the rundown of what happened, and why you should never visit this place. i walk in sit down in the chair, and the entire time i feel like i've interrupted the employees goal is session. they were talking and making inside jokes the entire time and my hairstylist never really listened to what i was saying. i asked for a fade with a 1 guard and after she fumbled around for a min or so in her messy work station she finally pulls out a 1.5 guard and secretly slips that on thinking it will work. first the fade line is not even, there looks like there is patches of missed hair that just got passed up with the clippers. she also missed trimming the hair around my ears and my neck line. had to go to cutthroat barber shop to have them fix it. do not go here...ever"
"recently i've been looking for a new place to get a haircut in the area because my other one had switched to a different place. well i came across this location because it was close to my job. well i just wanted to say that i am very pleased and lucky to have found this location because kelly is the best. she does a great job on the style that i want and she's also very personable. although she does cut my hair very quickly, she cuts it the way i request it. if you do decide to go here ask for her. you will not be disappointed."
"had the ""anti-gray"" treatment for men yesterday.  i have had it done before, at another shop, and was pleased with the results, very subtle.  the treatment consists of finding the right color so it doesn't alter your existing hair color, only minimize the gray.  they are supposed to choose the dye formula based on your existing hair color.  apparently this technician thought brown was close enough and i ended up having my hair dyed.   it is quite obvious.  to supercut, if your technician doesn't know what they are doing then do not allow them to work on clients."
"i get nervous trying a new place because i've had some pretty horrific haircuts growing up but i've been surprisingly satisfied with supercuts.  they aren't the best cuts and it's not really for style or to impress but it gets the job done to a level i can live with.  linda cut my hair and she seemed like she knew what she was doing.  she was fast, asked questions, and did a pretty good job.  i was a walk in and had no wait right after work.  they offer the 10th cut free and give you some coupons after you check out ($5 off, $4 off, $3 off).  good experience and will probably go back."
"my hair is thick, straight, and full of more cow licks than a weekend at the lilith fair, so the fact that these guys can even make my haircut look competent consistently is enough for 3 stars.but the fact that they're the only supercuts i've ever been to that stocks current issues of wired, sports illustrated, spin, and probably a few others that i can't remember nets them an extra half star. honestly, i'd be thrilled by any thing that wasn't jet or ebony, but this is above and beyond. the other extra half star goes to the awesome staff. they're always talkative, but not pushy talkative. they'll chat, but they'll also stfu. it's a perfect middle ground. every single person i've encountered there is awesome. i would honestly give them a whole other star, pushing the total up to 5, based on the excellent music played, courtesy of each individual employee having their own pandora station, but 5 stars to a supercuts would be ridiculous, and i'd lose whatever credibility i had left after the lilith fair joke. but seriously. go get fro-checked at the one on 43rd and then come to this one, you'll see what i'm talking about. this place is the best supercuts ever."
"gloria gave me a great cut! the tea tree treatment was wonderful, complete with hot towel wrap. enjoyable experience."
"being out of town and needing a haircut don't mix well for me.  i have a usual stylist at home with a set appointment every other week.i was desperate, and having seen a supercuts tv commercial the night before i decided to  yelp the closet location to where i was staying.upon arrival, i was greeted kindly.  checked in and waited for the next available stylist (i wish i would have gotten his name).  when called back the gentleman listened to my requests, did a great job of keeping me updated, offered mirror to see the back multiple times, carried on a good conversation, offered shampoo which i accepted and got a nice cranial massage that felt amazing and topped off with a warm towel over my face that smelled minty.  all while laying in a massaging chair.my expectations were exceeded!  left feeling rejuvenated."
"so i just got my haircut from this location and i am writing this review still confused about my service. why confused? because this was my 2nd time using supercuts but my 1st time going to this location. my first experience was at the kirby/main location and my walkout price was $20 (not including tip) for a basic cut, shampoo & blow dry. at this upper kirby location, i walked in and said ""i want a shampoo, trim & blow dry"" and my total came to $58...$58!!!...for what i thought i was going to be the exact same cut i received at the previous location. whenever i went to pay out and she said the total, i thought i misheard her, so i asked her again. nope, she said $58. i was shocked in my thoughts but didn't say anything....but i should have thinking back on it. i even saw a sign by the cash register that said ""ladies special: cut, shampoo & deep condition for $26"" and i didn't even get s deep conditioning so i still don't know why mine was so much more. yes she did spent more time cutting my hair than the first person and i guess she ""styled it"" versus just doing a basic blow drying like the other person did, but i didn't ask for it and just though it was the way she blow dried vs. the other girl i had previously. but still, even if that was considered to be a ""style"",is that warrants a $38 difference from my original experience i had at the other location???? see why i am confused! i just moved over to this area so that's the only reason i went here instead of the other location. if i want to pay almost $70 for a haircut, i would go back to my fancy salon. ugh. only thing i can think of is that she asked if i wanted to keep my long layers and i just said ""you can, they are prolly all grown out so just an inch trim is good."" she ended up doing more layers than i had before but whatever, it's hair, it will grow out. still bummed because i was hoping to like this much more convenient location. i would also like to add that my 2 stars is based solely on the price situation. the location itself was nice, clean, friendly staff and played good music so just wanted to make that clear."
"i called ahead and the hostess said ""no wait"".  i arrived to a all the chairs filled and 6 people waiting. the hostess said i was next. then they took 3 people before me.  20 minutes later i was still waiting and walked out.  no one updated me or explained the wait.  i wouldn't recommend wasting your time."
the lady went shorter then we asked and my child was so distraught.  probably not going there again.
"i have been coming to this location on and off for few years as it is conveniently located but today was probably my last day. the ""stylist"" was in some kind of rush and had this idea of what cut she wanted to give me. in spite of repeatedly tell her she did what she had in mind and kept literally running through the job even though there weren't many people waiting. she was opening this drawer in from to take things out and kept banging my leg every time and didn't even say sorry or anything.  this place has steadily increased prices by about 30% over the last 2 years which is outrageous for a cut that lasts 15 mins at max. i would suggest guys to find different place instead of coming here"
been going here since i moved to houston and it's really convenient and olivia is the best! the app keeps it easy to check in and the men's special is great.
"i recently decided to try cheaper haircut options, and supercuts is about 1/2 as expensive as my usual salon. based on some decent reviews here, i think it's just very hit-or-miss, and not worth the risk.i showed up as the store opened at 8:30, and the stylist sighed at me as if i was inconveniencing her. she spent the whole time sighing and slapping my head with the comb. she argued with me when i asked her to make changes. she did not ask me if i wanted a mirror to see the back of my head; i had to ask myself when it became apparent she expected me to leave. supercuts has a shampoo option, but she didn't ask me if i wanted it. i unfortunately didn't get her name, but it's not like i'll be back. other people seem to have favorable reviews of this place, so just go at your own risk."
i got a haircut and the wait was not long and results were good. tons of parking and near a bus stop.
"i had dulce or dulche and she was rude. i normally come here and get jose who's wonderful but i was in a rush and he wasn't in. i sit down and she starts combing my hair and complains about it being tangly (my hair tangles extremely easy) and tells me about 4 times that my hair is damaged. i'm well aware hence the hair cut. so she cuts an inch off and i decide to cut another inch off.. she said to me with an attitude ""that's what i told you in the beginning when i said your hair was damaged"" and acts as if it's wasting her time if i cut more off. won't ever get her again."
"came here expecting the same quality/value i've received at previous supercuts. it was a mistake. in fact it probably soured me on the whole supercuts franchise. i used to go to supercuts because my haircut is simple, so i prefer to spend very little to get it done. supercuts used to be ""budget"" but still decent results.that has changed. this location charged about $17 (i was used to abour $12.95 at the sugar land location), and none of the hairstylists (all females) were friendly at all. if i'm going to spend $17+tip on a haircut, i'm going to go to a real barber. no more supercuts for me i guess."
i went by this location at 815p and they had the door locked i leave work at 8p this place deserves no stars
"i have been going to super cuts for a while to get my hair cut . and every time i went i was unhappy with the way they cut my hair. well i went to get my hair cut on saturday july 2, and i took a picture in with me for an example of how i wanted my hair cut. the lady who cut my hair never asked me how long or short i wanted my hair. she just started cutting and she cut my hair way to short. i am very unhappy and mad. i will never go to super cut again. i am done with them."
i went here for a while because i don't like to pay an arm and leg for a haircut.  ya it was cheap but it got the job done for two to three weeks at a time.  went through three or four different stylists before i settled on one.  everything was going well for while then it seemed like they started rushing through my haircuts.  slowly but surely the quality went down.then i noticed that they had changed the front desk person a few times.  i finally quit going after i had scheduled an appointment and when i arrived they said they didn't have it down and no more slots where open.  i let the first time it happened slide but after the second time i was done.  on to the next one.  it's too easy to find another spot to cut my hair and probably do a better job.
"i can't believe i went here for a haircut. and i can't believe i'm now writing a review about it...i chose to go to supercuts because i recently spent a great deal of money on a ouidad haircut and later decided i wanted to get some length taken off my hair, but didn't want to spend a lot at the aveda salons that i normally go to. i really just wanted a few inches taken off my overall length and thought - how badly could supercuts mess that up?i went after work, on a monday, around 6 pm. it was fairly crowded, mostly with men. they were very friendly and were playing 104.1 the whole time i was there. the hair stylists definitely seemed like they're most accustomed to doing men's haircuts. they asked me if i wanted my hair shampooed and cut or just cut. were they going to cut it dry??initially the stylist did not even ask me what i wanted to do to my hair; i think she just assumed i wanted a trim, but when i asked her to discuss it before she washed my hair, she was very receptive. the stylist encouraged me to cut my hair ""all one length"" instead of with layers (i think she really just didn't want to have to do the layers). after cutting my hair (which she did very quickly and kind of without combing it first...), my stylist had to help another stylist with a more complicated cut, so they had someone else blow-dry my hair. the lady who blow dried my hair seemed very nervous and used almost an entire bottle of straightening serum on my hair. however, she did a good job , so i can't really complain about it. the entire time they were cutting and blow drying my hair, they had it parted down the middle. when the lady was finished blow drying my hair, it was still parted down the middle. i laughed and asked if i could use a brush because that is not normally where i part my hair. she looked at me like i was crazy. really? how many people part their hair right down the middle??anyway, overall, i am very satisfied with the haircut. i definitely won't go back to supercuts for my regular haircuts, but it was a not a terrible experience. i would go here if i were a man...or if i had little boys who needed haircuts. the saddest part is it wasn't even that cheap. with tip, $50! i should have blow dried it myself at home..."
"ladies, do not cut your hair here! if you are detailed about your hair, don't come to this location. the lady was careless of my directions and just cut it even when i asked her to follow my slanted angle cut. the manager had to help her fix it! literally just cut your hair yourself before going here. it's no wonder i was the only girl in the salon. maybe it works for men but not women... just dont."
i have been getting my hair cut here for about a month now and have never been disappointed. there is rarely a wait and the prices are great. the service and personality of the stylists are great. you will feel welcome here.
i do not recommend this place. the hair dresser was not helpful. she just wanted you in and out asap so she could move onto the next customer.
"ask for the men's special w/ tea tree shampoo, its pretty relaxing.it can get packed w/ men getting cuts before a wknd, but service is good, fast, and friendly."
"horrible skills ,they cant even make the sides identical ,what an amateurs,just wasted 17$."
i've been going here for about a year and i'm always satisfied with my haircut. i think i had one bad haircut but never saw that stylist again.  always quick as well.  overall i would recommend this place to any guys.
"i got a haircut for $16. i paid an extra $3 for a shampoo, as i needed to go straight out afterwards for a meal. it seems the hairdresser i had does not care too much about the customer. while my hair was being washed, she used only her right hand and did not thoroughly wash it. i could see her staring into space (and not at my hair) the entire time she was washing my hair. as a result, the right side of my head was clean - i'll give her credit. the left side however was still had a lot of loose hair (see below). maybe she could have tried a little harder. side note, it didn't look like her left hand was broken or injured as she was using it for other stuff. i could be wrong, but if i pay an extra $3 for a shampoo wash, i'm hoping my hair is decently washed, and that the amount of loose hairs is reduced. when i went to pay at the counter, i brushed my hair, and you can see hairs all over the hand. only reason i am giving 2 stars is because the manager there offered to blow dry my hair as she can tell there was a lot of hair, even after washing it. my hairdresser said she'll do it and then resumed to blow dry it very quickly, but was not very thorough. after i stepped out of the salon, i brushed the back of my head once with my fingers through the hair. i had a palm full of hair (on the left). i feel like the quality (at least at this site) was just not there. baseline 1 star. giving a second because the manager seemed to be nice, and a 3rd total because prior supercuts from this place was decent. at this time, with the current employees they have now, would not recommend."
"never go here the lady was rude made fun of my haircut, rushed me out the door to go sit down and watch family feud and got annoyed when she wanted a tip.  she dinnt listen to any request to how to cut my hair and was very rude never ever coming back again she bragged she had been hear for 10 years worst experience of my life."
the lack of service at this location has gone down. not to mention the price! it's almost like every time i come the price in a men's hair cut goes up. i will no longer be coming to supercuts for the type of hair cut they gave me they were literally done in 5 minutes they didn't take the time to give me a proper cut and the lady acted like she didn't want to be there. what will no longer make me come back to supercuts is the service and new price. if i'm going to pay $17.00 plus tip i might as well will go to a real barber shop one that knows how to cut hair.
"this place is amazing! it's a very comfortable waiting area, and you're always greeted with a smile. the stylists treat you like family. kerri is fantastic. if you get her, you won't regret it."
"i was in need of a quick, easy, last minute hair fix before my vaca since my normal stylist was out of town.....so i broke down and decided to give supercuts a try. honestly, i was very hesitant because i am used to ""high-er end"" salons (that charge way too much for simple basic cuts) and a high end salon this is not......but hey, it was quick and fast and that it what i needed. i was surprised to find out that there was a location right across from krogers on main in the same shopping center as smashburger. i called before driving there just to make sure they weren't busy and she said they had 2 stylists working with no wait. got there and yep, no wait because i was the only one there lol. alicia (if that is how you spell here name) greeted me, got my info and told me to come on back. may i add, she made zero small talk.....barely spoke at all. i had to ask her name, ask for a shampoo. i mean you don't have to be all chatty but the basic simple friendly conversation would have been nice : /  and after she cut my hair, she took my cape off (while my hair was still wet) as i asked confused ""can you blow dry it??"" she replied ""it will be an additional $1."" i mean, she was nice about it but it just really confused me and caught me off guard because i just figured that it was included.....or figured she would have asked. prolly should have told her it was my first time here so she could have pre-told me about this ""build your own package"" kind of a thing. still, super weird to me but i guess its just a basic  in-and-out kind of a place......which i can dig.let me break down the pricing situation for you: basic women trim/cut: $16shampoo: extra $3blow dry: $1walk out price for my 45 min appt = $20long story short, i liked my cut so i would say it was worth it and that i would return again."
"on a tuesday morning, for $16 (plus tip) diana gave me a super great haircut! i like it better than my $35 plus tip haircut at my previous hairstylist in austin. she didn't wash my hair but sprayed with a spray bottle and ended with a quick blow-dry to freshen up. she did long layers, a v-shape in the back, and cut off the dead split ends. i wanted it kept long, simple but classy, and healthy and that is what she gave me. i felt she really knew what she was doing - very efficient and proficient.5ish minute wait as a walk-in. very clean location. conveniently located next to kroger and the its fuel station for my grocery shopping.definitely will be going back to diana for my next haircut! :)"
i went because of 9.95 coupon. they asked for your name and i told them i don't want my name registered just for a haircut so they said just make up a name so what's the point of getting your name?then she asked why i looked upset so i told the lady that of course because you insist of asking my name and i didn't want my name registered and get emails and robocalls and just mails to my mailbox. anyway when i paid with my credit card she looked at my receipt and said your name is ****. what a jerk.not coming back.
"friendly staff, fast service and as good as it gets! great new salon!"
"the stylist that cut my hair seemed like she would much rather be somewhere else from the second i entered. she wasn't friendly to begin with and sprayed water in my face at one point. at the end, she didn't even attempt to dry my hair so i walked out with dripping wet hair. (i would have gladly paid a dollar for my hair to be blow-dried, but i didn't know that was an option at the time) i've been to this supercuts before and was pleased with my stylist during that visit, but after this visit i would not recommend that anyone go for a walk-in haircut here"
"i came in for a quick haircut and only asked for a low fade on the sides(1&2). the stylist does a 1 on the lower part behind the head and the rest of the sides were a 2. next thing i know, the stylist starts cutting the rest of my hair(enough for a small topknot) before i could ask for a small trim and a thinning. my hair ended up blending with the sides and it was uneven everywhere. make sure you stop them before they do something you don't ask, or hopefully they know not to do something no one asked for."
quick and friendly service. never had any issues. and the prices/ offers are pretty good too.
"quick cheap and friendly service for men and kids. not suggesting this place for women, they are not particularly precise in the details. but overall great, if you need a basic haircut."
"my husband just came home from getting a haircut and it is by far the worst haircut i have ever seen. he was angry and frustrated because she couldn't get it right after he showed her pictures of his past haircuts. she did not blend at all so it literally looks like she took a buzzer to the sides of his head and didn't touch the top. he didn't remember her name but she should not be cutting hair. he is now on his way to another salon to get it fixed. absolutely horrific experience. i advise everyone to stay far, far away."
i had two haircuts at this place. wonderful experince. i will definitely go back. i am picky on my hair and i always give tips and directions on how i want my hair to look. they were very respectful and did exactly what i asked. you barely find a supercut to do a custom haircut for you. most barbers know some routine styles and they follow that. the check-in and welcome was great as well. i recommend this place.
great spot for a quick haircut. i have been here a couple of times and was happy with their work. right by tmc so very convenient to drop by while on lunch break or on the way to work.
"just discovered this location. it's very spacious and there are many chairs, which make the wait way less than most hair salons. very friendly services. and easy to get the look you want. would definitely come back."
"i came in today, with the knowledge that my hair cut wasn't going to be the same caliber at my regular salon but i this was the only opportunity i had to get haircut prior to giving birth. when i walked in i glanced at the pricing, noting that it would be 29.00 for a haircut iii. they were able to see me promptly, and as i was walked to the shampooing station in the back. the stylist mentioned the haircut costing 18.00 and the cost of the shampoo and product being additionalthe haircut was everything you would expect going into a super cuts. layers needed blending and were pretty basic, again this was what i was expecting. she then began to blow dry hair. she used a comb and parted it on one side and did brush it once she was finished. the only hot tool she used was blow dryer. this was all completely fine, and what i expected. i will say, the staff was very prompt and my stylist was friendly and my issue is not necessarily with her.the shock came when i checked out, and was given a bill for $84.00. after they itemized the receipt, i realized i was charged sixty dollars to blow dry my hair. they would not refund my money because it was ""styled"" despite not using a single hot tool.  i was told that the blow dry that is ""just removing some of the wetness from the hair."" i would have been much happier with the entire experience if someone had discussed this up front."
"i don't like to spend much on my trims. supercuts is nicely priced (i spent $20, tip included). this location is the nicest supercuts i've been in. the venue is newly remodeled, modern and fresh. the staff was very nice and i had no wait time. great place to go for a quick spruce-up!"
"growing my hair out for my wedding in march, but needed to trim it up to get rid of some split ends. told the guy i just wanted a trim 2 inches off at most. straight across the back. i have super straight hair so this task should not be difficult for a professional. walked out of there with uneven hair, jagged ends and 4-5 inches chopped off! i would go back and ask for my money back and for them to fix it but i don't want i lose anymore inches! time to pay someone else to fix it :("
i've been pleasantly pleased with this supercuts.... very friendly and efficient. i have a hairdresser however for in between cuts and basic salon services i recommend this location.
"awesome haircut joint, ask for tina!"
carolyn was awesome. i took my niece to this location for her birthday. carolyn was wonderful with her and took her time to get the cut right and did it with a smile. great job!!!
omg i went today there and i left crying!!! i told the lady i wanted my hair short in the back and longbin the front like a bob cut!!! but nooo she freaking cut all my hair to the shoulder length no long layers or short layers. i'm soo disappointed!!! never again coming back!
worst place to get a haircut. they have people with no training cutting hair . i took my daughter today to cut her hair and i told the girl twice clearly that i wanted only 3 inches cut and in a v shaped in layers. well she kept cutting and cutting because she could not get the the hair cut right. i went and told her she was cutting to much and she said she had asked my 12 yr old if it was fine. who asks a 12 yr old? when i had already told her how i wanted it cut. after my daughter having waist long hair her ended up shoulder length. her name is juliann ozuniga !!warning!!!! do not go here's
this place is great and yesenia is lying she didn't do it wrong it's probably just her because from what i know that hair cut can't be done without making the sides look smaller if she cut hair she would know that so you doing just fine julieann ozuniga just fine.
"always busy especially during lunchtime and after office hours since this supercuts is in downtown surrounded by office complexes. normal waiting time for walk-in is not bad, perhaps 10-30 minutes max since most clients are men and we just need a quick haircut. however they do have apps that enable you to check in ahead of time so the waiting time can be reduced. my go-to stylist is martha; she is awesome and gives excellent service. she ensure that she understands my needs and expectations before she started to work. i'm always very satisfied with her work results.once in a while on afternoon just before the weekend some women came in as walk-ins to get their hour plus full treatment before going out - dyeing, curling etc, that it backed up the whole system and some of us guys just have to cancel our pre-approved appointments. with the type of clientele they have (mostly male, time-conscious businessmen and professionals), perhaps it's best to ensure that there is maximum allocated time per client for special cases like these in accordance with the number of stylist they have, to ensure we all can get good timely service with no pushback or cancellation."
"the supercuts app does not work! i used it to reserve my spot, show up on time and was informed they did not receive my appointment in their system. i showed them my phone app but that did nothing for me. very disappointing!"
"gloria, the only good stylist there is gone now so there is no reason to go back. in addition, they moved it to the allen center food court where everyone stares at you while you are getting your hair cut and there is no glass partition like at hair places in the mall. it is like you are an animal on exhibit in the zoo. if you are curious gloria is now at norba's hair salon (116 pecore st) ."
"i live downtown, it's quick and convenient as long as you make a reservation ahead of time. they are always short staffed so if you walk in be prepared to wait a little."
"good, quality haircuts. pleasant stylists. great value."
"big shoutout to my girl maria molina. ain't nobody touching dis head, but her. she should work 7 days a week, just so i can get a haircut any day i want. :-) jk... anyway, i've gone through several locations and hair stylists before finding maria the great!! i've been in la for over 3 years, and super happy that i have this. my relationship with maria has certainly lasted longer than any of my boyfriends. that search continues! that's how i know she's a keeper. my hair isn't difficult to cut, but y'all don't know how many times people have messed it up. she can carry a conversation. nothing worse than complete silence while getting a haircut. this is the most convenient location for me. they're consistently busy, so i recommend calling to schedule an appointment or use their app to book one. also, this location offers a rewards program. earn yourself a free haircut after so many. one hour parking with validation."
super unprofessional lacking basic customer service skillsunorganized greeting customers when walking in seems to be the hardest things for the employees heresurprised they still can stay open much better and professional services availabile in the neighborhood not recommended
maria c. made me look my best on an important night! black tie event and the night was amazing because i felt good and i looked good. she always does an amazing job and does exactly what i ask for. she remembers how i like my hair but always checks in with me just in case i want to try something different. i always look forward to getting my hair cuts with her. at my last visit she recommended something called a flashback that would help minimize the appearance of gray hair and it was perfect. it didnt look unnatural. i'm not ready to age gracefully and i dont have to now. go see maria c....she is the one with great style and the amazing red hair!!!!
"i should've known better than to go to super cuts in the first place, but i thought how hard could a bang trim be? apparently it is difficult. the woman who did my bangs had bright red hair and pretty messed up bangs herself. she cut my bangs extremely short and made them all crooked and jagged! i told her i didn't want them that short, and she did the complete opposite. i've never had such a horrible bang trim in my life. extremely disappointed. do not get your hair cut here!"
"maria curiel (the little red head latina ) does my hair every time per my request . she's so detail oriented,   patient and a perfectionist ! i come out looking better every time ! she's a little hidden wizard hair gem here and i thought i'd share my secret !"
"maria gave me a great cut. i have a ton of hair and just asked for a trim to get rid of some dead-ends, but she threw in layers and did a nice job! i gave her a tip that was almost equal to what the cut cost b/c honestly, it was so cheap and i was not expecting such a nice cut. i will be back!"
"been coming here for years and always find a stylist that i am happy with and keep coming back.  for the past 6+ months that has been maria c.  she's friendly, got a great attitude, and does an excellent job with my hair.  and can't beat the price of supercuts!"
"richard is my go to hairstylist at supercuts weho .. he is the best , professional , courteous, friendly and most of all he listens and provides me exactly the cut i want ... i would highly recommend richard he rocks!!!"
unfortunately i will not be returning to this location. i normally always go to eric and he is fantastic and always gives me exactly what i want and listens very well. the past few times i have been missing him and i have been getting other stylists who do whatever they want. this past time took the cake and now i am walking around town with a mohawk because she didn't listen to me when i said skin fade. so she took in all the way up to the top of my head and took both sides in. not what i wanted at al and now i have to sport a haircut i literally hate.
"if you need a blow out don't overlook this place! i was in a huge rush and major pickle. no other salons could get me in and all blow dry bars were booked. i called them up with fingers crossed and they got me in!  i didn't know who was going to do my hair when i got there but i got erik!! he was awesome. i have so much hair. and i can say without a doubt, it was the most professional and perfectly executed blow out i have ever gotten. (and i have gotten dozens). it was total perfection. i'm not even joking. he washed my hair super well, separated my hair into pieces and it was done very quickly. dare i say better than a proper blow dry bar??? i would go back and ask for him again. and the price couldn't be beat."
i've been coming here for years but the service is going way downhill.  the new guy who has a buzz was a total jerk.  need to revisit management.  i think this is why all the good cutters are leaving.
"well... i am 30 years old, and i have gotten by far the best fade i've ever gotten in all of those 30 years.  her name is bethany, she is beautiful, talented, and knows how to fucking cut some hair.  hey seriously, i looked at myself in the mirror for eight hours trying to find anything wrong with that haircut and there was nothing, it was perfect.  she is the blonde with long hair and i for sure have a new hair dresser.  i have been traveling to her from korea town but now i'm moving to west hollywood and i'm excited!  go to her!!!!!"
"i had one really good experience and one really bad one so i gave it 3 stars it's an average, if i would have had my bad experiance the frist time i would have never gone back. lady with the red hair messed up my hair cut looked labsided then she cut it super short, thank god hair grows back and grows back fast (: ... she probably saved me money lol but i hate my hair cut this short"
"i love my stylist she does a great job.this review is only for the hair color supplies. how can i have a great result if you don't have the shades in stock. if you are changing the supplier, first have the new shades on hand and then discontinue with the old ones."
"thank you, maria molina‼i love the color and the cut‼ great job with listening and nailing my hair!great location, nice clientele, very friendly staff, clean shop!  don't let the fact that it's supercuts deter you--all talented hairdressers who are conscientious and want to please their clients!  def! going back for highlights with maria m!thanks again for the supercut‼"
"i've been coming here for years, and i was glad when i found richard after other stylists i used have moved on. he always cares about his work and is clear in making sure he understands what i want as he cuts. it's obvious that he takes pride in doing a good job, and i appreciate the work he does. i've driven out of my way to see him and will continue to do so."
"$21 per cut.  $16 tuesday's (add the savings to your stylists tip).had a shaky start but found a particular stylist i like, so i call ask for them and set an appointment time when i need a great cut.  there's a few very good stylists here who do a great job and are very customer service focused. if you find someone you like get their name and call and ask for them next time.  going in randomly is chancy."
this is great place for haircuts and the pricing is a real value. they except reservations and take walk-ins. there's never a long wait. staff are very friendly and customer focused. richard is my regular stylist. he's awesome and always goes the extra mile to be sure my cut is just the way i like it. i highly recommend richard or any of the other great stylist.
"i've literally had the worst cut of my life here.  i've lived in weho for over 12 years.  i've frequented here a few times.  (i guess i forget how awful it is...)  tonight i had an experience that will keep me from coming to this rotating door of inexperienced hairdressers.   where do i begin?  my hair is a ""4"" trim around most of my head - not too hard right?  then i ask the rest to be trimmed the same length.  if this is done correctly i style it perfectly how i want it.  how i want it is that i take a sharp comb and cut a part off of some of the hair on one of the sides forming a sort of strip of the longer hair forming the parted side, with the rest going in the other direction kind of messy.  a crucial step in making this possible is no 'blending' and also stopping with the 4 at the point of my head when it starts to curve inwards towards the center of my head from the side.  (ie shave the part of the head on the sides that is flat; but stop before it starts to curve.)  similarly in the back.  (ie stop before it starts to curve inward at the top.)  its crucial because i will often change my part from right to left depending on how i feel.  evenly cut with no blending.  tonight i gave these very explicit instructions to the girl there.  she nodded her head as if to understand, then proceeded to do a 4 shave all the way up my head past the curve leaving a patch, yes a patch of longer hair at the top - and on top of that the hair left was unevenly cut so there was no switching part.  making a pudgy face look even fatter.  ruining the style people are used to seeing on me probably for weeks!!!! the register asked if i wanted to leave a tip. i said, ""no, it was the worst haircut i've ever had.""  then she had the audacity to say, ""you can come in up to 7 days for a restyle""  restyle what?!?! unless you can magically attach my hacked head hairs back in place to start over... what is to restyle?!?!  i can hear it now, ""ok, how would you like to restyle:  do you want the saving private ryan or the ever attractive franciscan monk doughnut athelstan shave... because that's the only hair we have to work with...""so the bottom line is i have to style it as hitler hair towards one side (uneven hair) till it grows back.  and i have a job interview.  i'm sorry but an apology from the cash register doesn't help.  its like going in for a ball hair trim and walking out with an unsolicited vasectomy.  does an apology really fix it???  how about an offer to come in to restyle??  nope."
i always get a great cut here. both marias are excellent- tonight maria c killed my cut. thanks again guys xo
"i came here on a friday afternoon before rush hour.   i was prepared to wait the 25 -40 minutes as i have read from previous reviews how long the wait can be.  it is highly advised to schedule an appointment beforehand as i noticed customers were coming in after me with appointments which took precedence.  the parking shares a lot with vons and it doesn't cost anything to park.the staff were very friendly and professional.  the atmosphere was pleasant and simple.  on the ripoff scale, typical haircuts for me range from $9 to $30 and this place is on the higher end of $21.  they offer to shampoo your hair at an additional cost which i declined.  some haircut places have a vacuum at the end of the clippers to collect excess hair, this place does not have vacuum so my head was full of freshly cut hair at the end of the haircut.  for the price, you get a good haircut to meet your specifications in a friendly atmosphere.  the wait may be an inconvenience if you decide to go as a walk-in.  they also do not offer retired veteran discount when i showed them my military id.overall, i was happy with my haircut.  this place is legit with 3 stars!"
"i really want to give them more stars but there long waits really made it difficult to do so. not sure i understand the appt. service, 8 have made an appt only to get there and have to 15 minutes more for the haircut? not only that but when you call they'll to place you on hold only to forget about you. then you call back and she will apologize and make up an excuse. but if your able to secure an appt. with trish i highly recommend it, she is really good. other than that avoid this place"
been going before they were even there. always get a good haircut. clean and friendly the place to go for haircut.
my go to place for a great cut at a reasonable price.  friendly and efficient service.   check in on my phone and usually don't have to wait long once l arrive.
very poor time management! make a 5pm reservation and basically sat and waited for more than 30 minutes waiting for my call-ahead / pre-made reservation! explain what the point of a reservation is if you don't get served at the time your reservation is for!
"ok so i really have been avoiding posting a review on this page but i gotta do so now. i live real close to this location so really i go to it the most but i really don't have the desire to go anymore. i would have givin a 1 but some of the hair stylist are really nice. like linda and three others i see in there cutting hair the most. my main complaint is about the girl who takes the reservations with red hair. she never says anything unprofessional but her attitude shows all over! especially when the bussiness is busy. all the times i've been there i have felt unwelcomed by mainly her. she is quick to say there is no availability. doesn't even suggest a wait time unless of course it is a busy day she is quick to say it's a few hours long wait. i've had to sit there and wait on my free days. she doesn't even get my attention to tell me when it's my turn. i've always seen the workers get the next guests, even if she is at the front desk doing nothing but standing there. i came in on mothers day becasuse i am a mother who was having a really hard day. all i wanted was a simple braided hair style cause i had to work that day which i'm am a hostess at a restuarant and was gonna work a long closing shift.. the people before me where walkins! a man and his two kids i believe and only two people were sitting waiting. at the time mainly men and women with short hair who where doing trimmings where getting their hair done & most where nearly finished. when i first walked in she greated me with no smile. this was at 12 or 1pm. i tild her all i wanted was a quick and easy simple style. i told her i need to be at work at 4pm. she appologized and told me she was sorry that i may need to wait 4hours or so because of other reservations. i asked her even if i sit and wait? i told her i was a mother too and it was my day too. i had tears in my eyes cause i was soo sad i wanted to get my hair done. i didn't even have enough time to walk home and due it up nice myself. she said sorry but no. i said thank you and walked out. i crided and ruened some of my make up. i stood there and said you know what i'm not gonna let this un-empathetic lady ruen my special day. i walked back in and she looked annoyed. i told her to please add me to the wait list that i would sit as long as i could. i was hoping someone wouldn't be able to come in for their appointment and they could let me take a place. so i waited. reservations showed up and hot their cuts. then new walk in customers started coming in and were taken right away. i was so upset but kept my cool and avoided telling her how i felt. then 3:30 hit. i had to quickly run home and do my hair myself. i almost called off cause how emotional that all made me feel. she definetly helped my mothers day get worse than it was already starting and she probably helped made that my last trip there. i wouldn't recommend anyone to go there unless they get a more friendlier front desk women who knows hospitality skills and professionalism. even while guests are waiting for their haircuts she doesn't even speak or offer nothing like at least the stylist do when they aren't cutting hair. never heard of a place help reun a guests special day if anything i've always heard wonderful turn out stories but not with her. lol i even always tip real generously after getting a cut even if it wasn't what i was expecting. just the time and effort you hair take to help someone feel good is appriciative ...  but that girl needs more tranning or a replacement. i'm not the problem cause i see plenty of similar posts & its sad.. thank you."
"i've been to this supercuts location twice. my hair isn't overly complicated (shoulder-length and pin-straight), and i've been satisfied with having 2-3"" inches trimmed during both visits. my first stylist, sonja, suggested i try a new product that has worked wonders on my easily tangled hair. today, yeghine cut my hair and she did great job - thank you!next time i will make an appointment. the wait can be a little long here, especially on weekends."
hi neighborsi understand why super cuts only has two stars. wanted to get a hair wash and blow dry for my 14 year old daughter today. it's winter formal after all. tuesday i was walking with her to get an estimate. 30 dollars for wash and blow. when we arrived two hours before the event i was told it is 60 dollars. i felt trapped as it was last-minute and i needed it done. this was way overpriced for the service and go to world cuts in the bristol farms complex for a much better deal and service.
"i got a haircut today by this lady whom i forgot her name. the haircut was good , but as i went to go pay. the lady who cut my hair was packing up to leave for the day which was 2:55 but the receptionist rudely told her to come back that she still has 5 mins.. the lady who cut my hair was still being professional but asking why theirs only 5 mins left the receptionist didn't care and told her to cut another head now.. this bothered me so much because one the receptionist was not professional at all , and also made the lady look stupid and feel uncomfortable when all she was doing was her job. the receptionist is always rude when i go so i wasn't surprised but be professional next time and pull her to the side instead of throwing a fit in front of the guess for her doing her job."
always love coming here for a professional and and affordable haircut. they're always available in a pinch and always give me a consistently good haircut.
"i've had my run ins with bad hair cuts and poor customer service but wow do these people take the cake.the people here have to be the rudest people i've ever met. as i arrived to the front desk, the lady told us our wait time and we checked in. i asked the lady if they have anyone who can texturize my very thick hair and she immediately said, ""your wait time is still going to be 45 minutes."" then i said, ""okay but i just wanted to know if anyone can do that for me."" and her response was ""well yeah everyone here can.""obviously they can't even cut hair because after my boyfriend's simple hair cut (not even a fade or anything.), his hair was pretty choppy after she sped through his hair cut. we thought the lady who was cutting his hair would be nicer but she was just as rude. my boyfriend gave her a 25% tip and she just took it and turned her back to him with just a ""thanks.""she also called my boyfriend my brother even though we were holding hands and our extremely different appearances.(i'm a redhead and he has dark brown hair with darker skin.) that doesn't really matter but you'd think they'd make an effort to pay attention to the people paying for their own perms.tldr;these people have garbage customer service skills and the hairdresser was awful at a finishing a simple haircut."
"first off i really hate leaving negative reviews. second i especially hate ( yes i know hate is a strong word) people with no common sense who don't listen! i stated several times please don't cut my hair too short, ( i'm a male) i wanted to say please don't fuck my hair up!  sure as shit she cuts it too short as well as uneven. and yes i know it will grow back. i can feel my blood pressure rise, oh and she's fucking humming to whatever lame ass song was playing on their shitty station. note to all hairdressers/stylists, please don't hum while cutting/styling a client/customer's hair, wtf how do you not know that!!!she could tell i was getting irritated, did nothing to try and mellow the situation out.zero personality and no service skills what so ever, who the fuck hires these people. and they're everywhere! it's actually my fault for choosing such a low ball place to have my haircut in the first place. thought i'd try and save a little money and it's close to my home.  um...., yeah no! note to supercuts,it would be in your best interest to hire better people. in fact i would be willing to screen your potential applicants. i could tell you in less than 2 minutes if they'd be a good fit or not. however i do understand the caliber of people applying and it must be frustrating knowing that all the really stellar stylists out there would never ever apply to supercuts in the first place. again i really hate leaving negative reviews"
don't count on them to be on-time with your appointments.  expect 30 to 40 minuets delay beyond your scheduled time.  they just can't get it right!
"i got a cut here a few months back by ruth, she's the one with a nose piercing. she was beyond awful. i had asked for a layered cut and before even wetting my hair, she went at it with the scissor. i'm no hair dresser but i do know that you can't cut across dry hair, it needs to be dampened first. i mentioned that to her as she was butchering my hair and she said this is how she learned it in school. luckily, there was a another hair dresser next to us, linda, who saw it all go down and came over and offered to take over. i used to be a regular there but since then i've been terrified of going back. it's not just that she ruined my hair because it does grow back, it's the fact that she was resistant to advice and acted as if she either was superior or just didn't care. i would caution anyone from having her cut your hair."
"you would think a place called supercuts would be able to give descent hair cuts.... i was very wrong! my bangs are not straight  and it looks like a 10 year old cut my hair. the lady was so bad. she never introduced herself, looked like she wanted to go home, did not listen to what i wanted. please reconsider going to this place for a 'simple' trim. go to a real salon with professionals"
"i just wanted to give everybody a heads (smiles) up that carman and this shop is great. i have lived in many great cities and had some wonderful stylistics  do my hair. carman is on my ""mt mount rushmore"" of stylists. do your head and hair a great favor and give this shop a try."
we love sharyl! she cuts my whole family's hair and it looks great! she is very knowledgeable about different hair and which cut will work for you. the shop is very clean and the receptionist is helpful. an all around great location!
"i've been coming here for at least 10 years and have always received the best service, cuts, color, and conversations.  i used to see john until he left, then linda, and now yehineh (prob not spelled right).  all were always kind & professional.  i like to try and call ahead for a same-day appointment.  i never have to wait very long.   linda & yehineh are fabulous.  this particular supercuts has a lot of repeat customers."
"worse experience ever! to be honest, they say they don't take appointments, but by coincidence all the caucasians got called before us even though they came after us. wow. i've never felt so disgusted by a business. they should have said something about the fact that they take appointments. however, we were completely ignored. never ever coming here again. when we left, one of the employees rolled their eyes. so unprofessional."
"i have a strange haircut that is not very conventional - basically all short hair and bangs except for one long braid. i am in the midst of experimenting with it, and every once in a while i need to discuss what would be better with a hair cutter rather than just my peers. but twice already, two different hair dressers at this location have managed to make me feel very uncomfortable. the first time, the lady was very intent on me getting rid of my braid after she had done the color in my hair (the color was done well, though). i decided not to get my hair cut there when she was pressuring me, so i left. but then a few days ago i decided to come back and give it another try, but i was met with a very aggressive lady who would rather not have a conversation about it and became frustrated with my questions. it's true that i was indecisive, but i wanted to know her opinion. in the end, she began to buzz my hair when i was not quite decided yet and it was a bit too aggressive. also, it wasn't very neatly done. basically said, don't go here if you want anything creative done. or if you want some sort of engaging conversation about hair. maybe there are a few cutters here that would do that, but the others are not so good. you might as well try somewhere else."
"hands down the best hair crew in los angeles. i've been coming here for over 9 years and i've gotten to know and love these people.they are all knowledgeable about their products and do great hair. i've had everything done here from highlights, deep conditioning treatments, root touch ups, betty bangs, pixie cuts to layering my long hair.they know what they are doing. there isn't a lot of turn over in staff so the quality stays consistent. its always clean, friendly, with a fun vibe. parking is easy and free! after using their suggested products i will never be using drugstore products again. its affordable, smells amazing and keeps my hair from looking and feeling damaged. there are so many options to go to for hair in this city but i always end up here because i know i will have quality work done at an affordable price. its the staff that makes this place priceless. you can tell they all love their jobs, they all have tremendous hearts and do amazing hair. no snobs, angry faces or divas. professional,  friendly, clean and qualified."
"so the haircut was fine. nothing special but fine for the price. and they said ""you know a blow dry costs more right?"" so my bad for not realizing that it would be more than the haircut itself. the kids cut was 20. the blow dry was 25. 25??!!might come back for a trim for her but will not do this again. make sure you ask for pricing for every thing they offer. wash? ask. dry? ask."
"no wait, quickly helped. the gentleman who cut my hair was marco. he did it very well. i liked the way it turned out."
"this team is amazing, friendly staff, and they give you what you ask.  earn points towards a free cut, i have 264 points lol. thanks guys for all your help. i love my cut, by rob. jacky, mary and crazy tony.. lol"
"i have been coming to this store since i moved to la back in 1999. i think that should tell you a lot right there. i've moved two more times since then and absolutely refuse to go anywhere else to get my hair cut. vickie, the manager, has become a good friend to me. i trust her and her staff each and every time because i know they are extremely professional. i have been to other stores just to check them out such as rudy's across the street. rudy's is fine. no problems with them, but i miss the closeness, the personal service i get from vickie's store. always a smile on their faces, some cheesy 80's music in the background  (the other day they were playing devo's ""whip it""!). but be careful because they will have you buy every product in the store before you leave, the crafty salespeople that they are...ha ha! who cares, right? as long as the service is friendly and you get as fantastic a look here as you would at some glitzy beverly hills boutique. i've never left disappointed and always look like they trimmed 15 years off of my life. how can one complain about  a place that makes you feel and look young again? vickie and her staff are truly the best!"
vickie is awesome! she pampersme with her friendliness and detailedness every time i come in to do hair cut and color. she makes me feel more beautiful after.
"went in to get my mom a new look to lift her spirits up, and we got some help from tonee to find a nice shade to bring some life back into her. i loved the shade and the cut, and i know my mom appreciates it too. so thank you tonee we will definitely be back, you were wonderful and very entertaining! amazing work!!!"
"great service, great suggestions with hair styles and products and overall very friendly. parking can be a hassle with the parking lot not being very big and it can get crowded but its worth the wait."
the manager vicky called my name and took me to the chair i told her if she will give me a second to just go and wash my hands said no problem when i came out she was already consulting another customer and i asked her if i was next and she didn't know because there was other people waiting even knowing tha she had already taken me before so i waited and a girl tony very nice but cut my hair in 5 minutes i paid and left but the hair cut was not even and very short i was very upset so i went back to talk to the manager and that's why i found out tia vicky was the manager and i told her that i was not happy and she got money or of the register and through at me and very pestle walked away there for will never go there again
"please read this !  this is my first & last time in this supercut store !!! i booked an appointment online and went there couple of months ago and i got mary ( older lady with glasses) to get a my hair cut ! horrible experience ! mary's got some attitude & she was done within like 8 minutes and then i asked her to trim my beard a little, big mistake ! i think she has no idea how to do a proper beard trimming as she did it super fast without any protection comb attach to the trimmer.i felt a slight pain in my cheek area after she was finished but nothing thought much of it at that time.after i shaved my beard completely a month later, i found a big red mark on my left cheek and till this day it hasn't completely disapeared !guys avoid this place unless the management gets rid off mary and hire some new friendly barbers who actually knows what customer service really means !!!"
"i don't recommend men coming here for a haircut. the cuts are un-even, choppy, and not blended. i have been to multiple stylists at this location and it has been mediocre at best. the haircuts are not cheap either, with tip my total comes out to 27$. everyone is very friendly and welcoming, for 5 stars for that. i'll go with another location in the future. hopefully management can reach out to rectify the multiple haircuts i've had unsatisfactory results with."
wonderful group all around. tonee is my favorite but all of them are good. great place for highlights or just a haircut. good prices on their hair products too.
"this place is sometimes busy but if you make an appointment online which is super easy and convenient, you should be fine. everybody is friendly and welcoming, from staff to manager. i like berto , very popular, and mary, very down to earth. they will cut and converse with you which i like a lot cuz it makes the whole experience less awkward. don't hesitate to make conversation or certain requests related to your hair style. mary can be a little tough in terms of attitude but once you get to know her, she can be very funny. the hair cut is decent and the price is reasonable, i always pay $22 and $5 tips i usually add. my style is simple i guess , either military or short on the sides and medium on the top with a blend. i have never had an incident when i'm not happy with the outcome before. anyways try yourself and see!"
"tonee did her magic again, made me beautiful and five years younger! she is awesome and caring."
"i've been coming to this location for many years.  tonee does a fantastic job on my cut and style and i always walk out looking and feeling great!   ask for her when you come in, or better yet, call ahead or use their app.  the staff here is very friendly and professional, and they take great care of the shop as it's always immaculate.  the prices are very reasonable as well."
"came in with my daughter, mary helped us as she was combing her hair she is pulling her, saying her hair is tangle and dry. duh thats why we went to get her hair cut, she had attitudedefinitely wont come back. not recommended."
"super bad service  ,i came in girl with curly hair white glasses didn't  even welcome me ,but another girl came in she welcomed her,anyways she signed me in and i told her i want a haircut  and shampoo. i asked her right before she started cutting my hair,if she could do my eye brows  too ,she agreed. well she started cutting my hair  too fast and too rough, so i stopped her and i said please be gentle, than after she slowly changed her speed lol,for my luck,the supercuts  machine that she was using started pulling my hair and it hurts  when that happens, so i told her the machine  is pulling my hair, shes like, wonder y,get a new or ask supercuts for new one ,i noticed she wasn't happy with me so far ,anyways, than my sides were not equally the same so i told her to fix it and uneven so i told her to make it more even and better ,at this time she was not happy and i wasn't either but is not my fault  that she don't know how to cut hair ,or is it that difficult hair?she lacks customer service and detail, i just want a haircut .they charged $20 dollars and they do a crappy job and they expect customer to be satisfy and not say a thing, i don't think so,i will not go there anymore.she washed my hair and dry it and than i was expecting  my eyes brows  to be done and i asked her and shes like oh they turned  the machine off already and i said you probably don't want to do it .not a big deal  but it shows how they treat customers  there .i went to pay and told the guy ,tall ball headed ,she told me she would do my eyebrows  too but than she refused so unproffessoinal. i pulled out 5 dollars for tip but than i changed my mind ,no she didn't  deserved  a tip for the lack of customer  service  and detail and told the guy ,it was a nightmare getting this haircut and she should not cut hair ,she don't know how and how to treat customers. sunday july 8th afternoon closing at 5 pm, girl curly hair and white glasses . the tall guy apologizes.dont go there crappy haircuts .worst worst worst super badcuts."
"i have black chick curly hair and vicky handles it! she's not scared of the texture, understands the wave pattern and makes me feel pretty when i leave. the wash is great because of the water temperature (i know that sounds weird, but trust me), the technique and the vibrating chair! if that doesn't work, put your feet up. i love my cut and i'll be back for trims regularly instead of doing it myself and creating holes (bad girl). thank you vicky for working with your girl! :-)"
"i just got my hair cut at this location for the first time and it was great. i reserved my place online and they got me in as soon as i showed up. marco cut my hair, and although i was a little nervous at first because i've never had a man cut my hair, he was great. he really listened to what i wanted, was so sweet, and executed it beautifully. will definitely come back to him."
"i can't speak for all supercuts, but i've had two great experiences at this location, specifically with vickie. i learned that she's been with this location for 30 years! i had been looking around for an affordable, reliable place to get a haircut and was tired of spending nearly $100 at nearby salons so i gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. both times, i received wonderful customer service and left with a happy haircut. and as with any salon, what really matters is the hair stylist who's working on you, so i recommend giving vickie at this location a shot. the receptionist armando is also super friendly."
"my favorite salon in the world!! is super cuts . mayra and monique are like an artists they are talented and have wonderful personalities to match. for high  lights i trust mayra with my life! that lady knows what she is doing when it comes to hair. she is such an amazing person inside and out. it's truly a great experience with her all around. for hair cut - i just found my new favorite girl , maria . this was my first time working with her and she did a fantastic job with my hair cut . she  knew exactly what i wanted, i think she might read minds. cannot wait to get my hair done again."
"i'm so sick and tired of coming to supercuts and having every single person give me a reason why i shouldn't thin my hair out with thinning shears. i'm 23 years old. i've had this thick hair my whole life. i know for a fact that layers are never enough. i don't need anyone's opinion about how they think it should be cut. hairstylists always want to do what they want rather than what the customer is asking. if i ask for layers and my hair to be thinned out, i don't need your two-cents unless you are going to spend the money on the haircut and the aspirin i have to take every single day from the haircut. supercuts needs to teach their employees not to throw 2 cents in. i've had every single person say something along the lines of ""oh but there's people who wish they had thick hair like yours."" okay and?! i told you i want layers and for you to thin it out - it wasn't a question. anyway... the people are nice ‍ but i'm gonna be going elsewhere. $20 ain't shit. rather pay $60. i've tried about 10 different times at different locations. girl bye.so i went back in and the poor lady tried really hard to make me feel better about the haircut that i was given by a previous stylist. i went to the counter and still asked for my money back, when angie -who cut my hair in the first place- came and said ""well we fixed your hair and you said it's fine so we actually don't give money back"". so i said ""well it still looks like shit so i still want my money back"". angie was definitely very passive aggressive about it and i tried telling her what she did wrong, she became even more passive. i told her that her friend shouldn't have come up to her while she was cutting my hair and she then says ""they are a customer and i talk to all customers"". uh no you say ""i'll be right with you"" and you focus on the customer that you have at hand. she was definitely very passively aggressive. i told her that i've been in management for years and that i just didn't feel like it was professional, to which her reply was ""and i've been in it for 10 years and i'll still be here.""like oh alright then so you can't take constructive criticism? cool.i didn't get the name of the lady who helped fix my hair but she was so sweet. i kept crying and she was really patient."
i been coming here to have mayra cut my hair for a long time.. then my son hair... now my daughter and husband comes too!!! but we are so happy that even though mayra is our for few months.... we have angie to the rescue!!!!!! yes!!! she is amazing and very careful and caring.... just like mayra!!! update!!! i still love our two amazing lady's!! angie and mayra!! they are kind and know how to cut all kind of hair ... that's a plus for anyone to know!
"i had a very pleasant experience at this location. there is a large parking lot right outside so that takes the hassle out of getting a haircut in la! i called a few hours before to make a reservation and they were ready for me right when i walked in. the staff was smiley and the facility was kept in tip-top shape. unfortunately, i do not recall the name of my stylist but she did a fabulous job. i got a 1 on the sides with a fade and a scissor cut on the top. it looks great.  the price was rather typical at ~$19 and they do offer discounts for usc students. you never really know what you're going to get when you go to a supercuts, but i can definitely recommend the vermont location!"
some of the biggest mistakes of my life have been haircuts and it took me awhile to find a place to rid of this anxiety and this place is it. if ur new ask for mayra or wendy they dope ! they're good people.
it was super fast i don't like to be in a salon for a long time and luis was fast and did a good job on my hair and my baby's hair which was his first time. and the girls that did my daughters hair did good too. i will definitely go back with my kiddos.
"i got a good haircut for curly hair and a good price.  was very nice and patient.  then she immediately tried to sell me expensive hair products, and after i paid for the haircut she literally ran to the next customer as if i had evaporated.  i will probably go back, so i hope this gets read and they realize people already know what hair products they want, at least i do, did not like the sales pitch and quick dismissal after i paid.  i'm sorry i gave such a generous tip, she didn't even say thank you."
"long wait times, horrible customer service.   staff doesn't disclose how their system places you in back of the line if you show up a late after calling ahead to allow the customer decide if they want to wait or find somewhere else to go.  staff didn't even apologize.  i've been coming here for years but level of service has gone down.  they have high staff turnover here."
"angie is the reason i go to supercuts. she's incredibly nice and does a great job consulting before cutting/styling my hair. she's extremely talented with so many years of experience under her belt.:)p.s.she's extremely great with kid, especially with my 2 boys :)"
just got a haircut and color at this location . totally loved it! my hair feels so soft and i love the color. would totally recommend angie!
this has become my go to barber spot. sometimes the wait can be long. but they do let you call ahead to put your name in line so when you get there you won't be waiting forever. every time i've been there i've been happy with my haircut. thank you
"i give this super cuts 5 stars and if i had the option to give more i would.the young lady who cut my hair was absolutely phenomenal. i am the type to be very skeptical with trying new style hair cuts but boy!!!!!was candy right. you can tell sheobtains the passion in what she does. she took her time on me and after my hair cut i walked out of there feeling  bedazzled and not to mention ten  years younger.she had superior customer service.she was a great listener, very honest  and went beyond my version of what  was excepted. i am not from this area ,but will be definitely coming back to her.she is like the hair whisper!!!!"
"my family and i had been customers for two years, that is until two highly unprofessional employees made rude and unprofessional comments in spanish about our appearances. needless to say that supercuts has now lost loyal clients. way to go!!! i will make sure that corporate hears from me!!fantastic sams here we come!!"
very unprofessional. i called an hour ahead for appointment and they confirmed it. but when i visited they said they couldn't find my name on system and forgot to enter on system so if i still wanted haircut i need to make another appointment.
"i went right before they closed. alondra cut my hair. i wasn't very sure what i wanted so she was very helpful on figuring out, cut my hair well. she's very friendly and can hold a conversation. i was very happy with the service. she had amazing customer service. i recommend people to go here for a haircut."
love love this place! especially mayra! she's absolutely great! i can't stress this enough always satisfied with my cut!!
i had the most horrible experience today i called in at 11:53 was told there was a 25 minute wait got there within the window and now an hour later i am being cut. the receptionist wendy took to clients ahead me and when i spoke about calling ahead she was downright dismissive.  i have always come here but this might have been my last time. really disappointed
"while looking for a new barber, i decided to just get a quick clean up over here at this super cuts. wendy gave me a nice fade but i was too skeptical to have her line me up hahashe was very sweet and funny. her skills are pretty good and i would probably come back here if my new barber didn't have time for me. definitely a nice store on vermont."
so bad experience. they are not professionals. they are just barbers. the fat woman barber just pushed very hard by using electronic clipper and that really hurts and make my skin red and pain. totally bad experience. would never be there again!
"my son badly needed a haircut, especially in this heat. it was great service and his hair looks great. thank you!"
"guys (and i'm sure this applies to everyone as well), if you're looking for a great hair stylist who pays close attention to detail and ensures a quality haircut, please ask for vasilya. she always does a great job.  she is great to talk to and i can tell she takes pride in her work. i am lucky to have her as my hair stylist. again, ask for vasilya!"
"worst haircut ever. one stylist on duty, five customers waiting as i walked out. perhaps she was under pressure, i don't know. but i'll never visit another supercuts after today."
"i've had good luck here over the past couple of years, but that ended the other day when i was in and out of the chair in less than 10 minutes, with the worst haircut i've ever had.lady, don't ask me how i want my hair cut if you have no intention of doing it.there are some lovely and talented people here. lupe, for example.you're no lupe.adios super ripoff!"
"supercuts is one of my favorite places to do our hair..... specially with alicia, this time unfortunately she wasn't there, so , we didn't have more options.this 1 star is for the girl who made my husband's hair... very bad job!! i'm very sad and angry because she don't have customers service skills!... i was sitting waiting for my turn when this woman for doing the job, at the beginning i was ok, but, then i noticed that she was cutting little bit to much his hair, so i went to her station i told her: please that is fine don't cut more, i will little long there for cover his bold spot.... she kept cutting, i was angry, worried and i stepped in her station for second time and told her: please stop!, i told you don't cut more!... and she rise her voice at me telling me: mam, i'm the professional here and spoke with him.... wrong !!... if i'm talking to you at the beginning you should listen to the wife!... you are the professional, but i'm the wife!, i'm coming here for about 5 years, and i know how he likes and how i want!... now i have to listen his complaints for every single day! alicia is totally different!.. always trying to keep good relationships with couples!!note: how ever your name is, try to be nice specially with couples, one relays on the other, not in you!, that's why they go together, if not... he will go alone! i'll keep going, because alicia only... lesson learned... no alicia, no cut. so sad.sorry for my english:/"
"i never feel compelled to give bad yelp reviews because i have experience working in customer service jobs. i know how awful they are.i always tell myself it can't be that bad. the wait is always 45 minutes, even if you're tricked into thinking that calling before or checking in on the app actually does anything. there are always all these empty stations, and i don't think i've ever seen more than 4 stylists working at once. the result:the stylists end up giving slapdash haircuts. they prioritize those who look the most upset waiting for their turn.this is a simple supply and demand problem. while i was contemplating during my wait, at least 5 different walk-ins came in. they were told the wait was 90 minutes and left frustrated without a haircut. i am not sure why a business would want to turn away customers willing to spend money. hire more stylists for all these empty stations, and customers will not have to wait."
"nothing short of absolutely terrible. the haircut was not even passable. back of the head was shaved 3 inches above where the hairline is supposed to be. makes me wonder if this woman has ever done a men's cut before... got my money back for the haircut (still made me pay for the shampoo even though i was coerced into getting that) but it will be a month before my hair is even long enough for my gf to fix it.... just don't go here. by the reviews, the other supercuts in santa monica is way better. really regretting not going there."
"horrible!! i wanted a blowout so i came here!! there was a blonde girl in the middle of a hair cut, she greeted me and was very nice. then the stylist that was supposed to help me myra ( i think that was her name) called my name ( i think she butchered it) she seems to have an attitude. i sat in the chair and she walked away taking phones calls!! i understand you need to deal with phone calls but don't leave your client waiting!! tell them sorry and take the call!! just just left me in the chair!! she had attitude!! after waiting i just got up and left!! very rude and has no customer service!! she needs to fix her attitude!! also the salon was dirty!! there was hair and candy under the seats in the waiting area!! i will never return to this location!! i'd rather go to dry bar!! myra you need an attitude adjustment!!"
this is the best supercuts i've been to in santa monica. the employees here are all very nice and friendly and greet you when you come in. they take time with you and don't rush you out of the salon as i've seen in other places. they are great with both coloring hair/haircuts. i definitely recommend this salon!
"i have been this salon last weekend.  i did color,.high lights, cut and blow dry by melissa.  she did really great job on me.  i never satisfied my hair in korea town or be very hills, but this time yes.she knows what to do and very creative.  i went out next day with my friend, they asked me where i did my hair.  i told my friend about melissa.  she is the best.i'll go to melissa again even she is little too far from me.  also, i told my boyfriend to go to melissa.thank you melissa!!"
"a simple buzzcut for $30. came home & just noticed, un-even, i should have taken a closer look before leaving. it is what it is, i'll try not to come back."
i love rafaella she's so terrific she needs to be promoted i've only had her for coloring and she's great i'm so glad she was found for me i don't know what i would do without her so if you want someone to do your coloring she is the one to do it she knows her stuff a+ a+ a+
"check in online because it says there is no wait, when i arrive there is obviously a wait and the three women at the register are unwilling to give me an estimate of the wait time. i'm sorry but on a sunday i have more things to do than wait for an undetermined amount of time. a simple ""oh 5 minutes"" or ""it could be an hour"" is enough. i am not going to sit and wait for you to not give me an idea as to when i will be helped. update your online list because it is obvious that 10 people did not walk in in the 5 minutes it took me to drive in."
"the girl that cut, i mean butchered my hair was nice but my hair is a hot mess! i wanted an a-line bob but left looking like a lego piece. whatever! maybe i messed by coming to supercuts."
i get my haircut there at least twice a month and autumn does an amazing job every time. finally i have a hair stylist i can count on plus she's a sweetheart! thanks!!
i am not a very happy camper right now with this place i know i'm not very welcome back here again and i don't care i was taking out of this wonderful persons care for my hair regarding coloring which is unfortunate i highly recommend this woman to anyone and i will surely miss her rafaella she's the only one that i could recommend as outstanding stylist i wish her well in her career. and i thank her for all she did trying to help me out
alicia the manager gave me a great haircut! i finally have an even cut and my split ends are all gone.  she also fixed my fringe and it looks so much flattering now! definitely a thumbs up.
i got a pixie cut and i'm trying to let it grow out. lupe totally knew how to cut my hair and help me continue to grow it out. love her! i always go back for a bit of a touch up so it continues to grow out.
"i went in on thursday september 21st 2017 for a trim and the bleached blonde stylist (as i don't recall her name chopped a chunk of the front of my hair before i had a chance to stop her and have the manager intervene. i even showed the stylist a picture of me with my hair the way i wanted it cut prior to her commencing. i had a video shoot the next day and to top it all off the manager still wanted me to pay full price. i had to ask for a discount and she only discounted $2. i need to get in contact with the regional manager so that she can see what they did to my hair as it looks like a 3 year old cut it. i do not feel i should pay a dime for the cut, infact, i should be paid for potential loss of wages for work that required my long hair. please contact me as soon as possible to resolve."
"worst stylist ever. last night i went to get a fade, chick gave me an undercut. i knew i was gambling with supercuts, but i was just too lazy to go to active barbers down the street. so annoyed."
loved the vibe here! from the minute we walked in we were greeted and given an accurate wait estimate. raphaela is amazing! she did an amazing job giving my grandma a new hair style. her hair had grown out so long and unmanageable and raphaela was able to create exactly the look we had described. i really appreciated that this location was so accommodating in making room for my grandma's wheelchair (we have had bad experiences at other locations).  thanks again for everything! see you soon :)
"okay, so this is my go to spot for a haircut and rocky is my man here. i love this guy. he is warm, super nice, and a great person to chat with while getting your hair done. i typically start with a tea tree treatment and shampoo and then follow it up with a regular cut. rocky knows what he's doing after he consulted with my wife who gave him precise instructions on the cut that she likes on me. rocky has added some finesse to her suggestions and i really like the results. rocky recently had a rather serious accident which left him away from all the action for a good majority of last year. while supercuts made sure i was taken care of in his absence i was so happy and relieved to see him back. he's not just my stylist, he's more like a buddy. and he has now cut my hair, my wife's hair, and my mom-in-law's hair so yeah his style runs deep in our household. happy belated birthday buddy! and may you always keep smiling and bringing joy to people with your magical hair styling tricks. update: rocky is the saving grace of this place. any time he's not there service is awful!"
"second review.  shirley my last experience was ok but once again i find myself in a horrible situation. i called 45 minutes ago and put my name in. they gave me a wait time of 20 minutes.  so when i arrived i checked in just in case. at which point they could not find my name. so here i am nearly an hour from my call. which again i know waiting is a possibility but when you call in advance and don't have the confidence that your proper place was held, it's frustrating.  then the girl at the counter replies to me saying it's been 45 minutes.... ""yeah there are two people a head of you we have a lot of colors today.  want me to take your name off the list?""nope. i didn't ask you to. what horrible customer service. unfortunately this is the last time i will come to this place.  first review was 2 stars.  the staff here was not adequate. if you tell your customers 15 minutes you should at least accommodate someone with 10 min of that time frame. we understand having to wait an extra 10-15 minutes but they kept taking in other customers that they seem to know and said they checked in before hand. well then should that be incorporated in to the time frame provided to the customer. if you told me i would be waiting for over an hour i would have done something else and come back. it was just poor man"
"i've been coming here for the last two years and it never disappoints. rocky, one of the hair stylist has always been amazing! the staff is so helpful and accommodating. glad this location is part of the neighborhood. did i mention rocky is amazing!?"
"araselli is amazing,can't say enough nice things about her as a person and a professional , she did a fantastic job on my cut , it was exactly what i was looking for. will definitely be heading back to her the next time highly recommend making an appointment with her. thank you araselli"
"staff is friendly and does a good job. however, would only go as a last resort. last 3 times i have had to wait over 45 minutes after making an online appointment. if you do come, would highly suggest arriving late as this seems to be how they operate - worse than the doctors office!"
"the worst. mediocre haircuts at best, and the world's worst queing system.i checked in online (at 5:50) and was told that i should be up at 6:30. its now 50 minutes (and counting) after that and there are still two people ahead of me. i get that it's hard to make accurate predictions of wait time, but this is ridiculous. there are only two people working.i was told ""probably another 10 minutes"" about half an hour ago. i'm beginning to forget my life prior to coming here. i think i had a family, but i can't be sure.edit: i just mentioned that i've been waiting an additional 50 minutes and was told (no apology) that ""we can't predict the future"". another customer just said he'd come back tomorrow and was told ""it'll be like this tomorrow too"". get your sh*t together supercuts."
"have had fine experiences here in the past but today was quoted 1 hour for a haircut, waited 75 minutes, and then told there were two more people ahead of me... and there was only 1 person cutting hair in there! had to walk out because i was out of time to spare waiting. please quote accurate times or staff up!"
"the place is clean and modern, and busy. call in for an appointment or be prepared to wait. i thought this was supposed to be a discount barber shop chain, but the prices were actually a bit higher than the local ones.my barber, rocky, was very friendly but way too salesy. i'm not sure if that's his fault though as it sounded like every stylist had to offer at least 10 extra products/services during the course of a haircut. that's an aggressive upsell strategy but should realize how uncomfortable that makes some customers.he did do a good job with the little hair on my head. but i think i'll be going back to the mom and pops barbers that offer similar quality cuts without the sales pitches."
my hair turned out way shorter than i wanted it. i asked for shoulder length and i am now sitting here with chin length hair. i was in tears most of the day about it. she just kept cutting and cutting it's very choppy you can see the hard cuts in it and one side is longer than the other. i'm so disappointed. they said next time i came in they would set me up with a specialist but i won't be setting foot in a hair salon for an extremely long time. terrible experience. :(
god awful. avoid this location. they give you bad information on wait times and bad haircuts after waiting. many other better options in la.
"lost a customer of 5 years today.  i've had countless stylists over the course of being a customer at supercuts; some were/are great and some are mediocre.  the vast majority of the time, the mediocre ones try their best and put forth a great attitude and effort.  today i experienced the worst stylist at supercuts.  every adjustment i asked for she had a rebuttal and reason for why i was incorrect in my judgement.  i asked if she could make a slight change on a fade and she questioned my request because my hair grew a certain way and she was correct.  at no time was she apologetic for any of her actions or behavior.  when i asked to completely remove the fade she completed a half effort job and i had to come home and fix the issues myself.  when i asked to take an inch off the top she consistently questioned why i would do such a thing and how she knew what was best because she understood how my hair grew.  again another half effort there.  the fact is, a bad haircut grows back but making a customer feel uncomfortable and unsure during the entire time, this is how you lose a loyal customer and future referrals.  i apologize to all the great stylists at supercuts because surely they contributed to me coming back time after time.  unfortunately this person is the straw that broke the camels back."
jessica did a great job on my hair. i just moved to the area and was in need of a new spot to just do simple trims here and there. i highly recommend her.
"i have been going to the store in the marina for 3 years. i have my roots and high lights done there. sorry to say i will not being going to this particular  establishment.  i went to get my roots done (about a 2 hr process) . my hair is normally a light brown color with high lights. now my hair is so dark that all my high lights are gone and what is left is like tan high light. (this took 4 hours. )the stylist was a little rough, he used a comb with a sharp end on it to part my hair, he was very hard on the back of the neck. i made a grimace face and said ouch. he said oh sorry dear i will be easy. as he proceeds to the side of my head he swipes inside the ear on both sides. i have so much more to say, but it feels like i'm reliving this nightmare."
"sloppy. no attention to detail on my 6 year old boys hair. i will need to re-trim around his ears and back of his neck. she didn't engage or acknowledge my son one bit!  the only interaction she had with him was to push his head down to crookedly trim the back of his neck.  not to mention she had absolutely no personality. probably said about 7 words to me and my son, total. at the end she handed me the ticket / bill and said here give this to the receptionist and tell her that her scribble said $22. not even a thanks for coming in, have a nice day or bye. ..nothing! then i noticed her apparent, regular came in, a nice senior lady, boom everything changed....she was all smiles and chatty....  night and day!   lame."
"if you're looking for a high-end beverly hills level cut without breaking the bank, you've got to come see rocky. when it comes to getting haircuts i used to dread trusting my looks to someone else so i'd always pay for premium haircuts. a friend of mine told me about rocky at supercuts in the marina and i just had to check him out for myself and boy was i impressed. he not only totally gets me, but we always have a blast brainstorming about cool new things to try. it's a treat to have him bring out your best and you'll have a hell of a fun time chatting with him in the process! this is what the 5-star rating was designed for."
"thank you to rocky for yet again another stellar job on my son's hair!  he is knowledgeable, talented with the clippers and scissors, and very experienced.  rocky is personable, friendly, and good with both kids and adults. my son is so happy with his haircut and says rocky is so nice.  it is very busy here every time we come, so make an appointment to cut down on waiting time."
visiting and had time to get a much needed haircut. went in on a whim and left super happy with the haircut cassandra gave me.she took the time to carefully discuss what i wanted and never rushed into styling. i really liked the outcome and it is exactly what i wanted. thank you so much.
"i'm not giving them 1 star because they truly tried to please me but i already had a real sour taste in my mouth. when i walked in, there were only 2 ladies sitting in the waiting area. they happened to both be waiting for this little girl getting a cut. as time went on, people would walk in and they'd ask if they were so and so and almost immediately take them to a chair that was freeing up. i watched 5 or 6 people come in after me but get taken to a chair ahead of me. confusing for a place who doesn't accept appointments. apparently you can call and ""check in"" an hour ahead....so i sat there for 45 mins before i got real irritated about what was happening. the manager handed me $4 worth of coupons and the guy who cut my hair offered a free wash with my cut. i had worked an 11 hour day and just wanted to get home so i declined the wash. the guy really did work hard to get me out of the mood i was put in. the next problem was when he handed me the little mirror to see the back. i pointed out how my right side was lower down my neck. he tried to fix it my starting in the middle and going to my left side...the side that was already higher. i really didn't want to create an even bigger scene so i just paid(they gave me $3 off) and i left. when i got home, my fiance expressed that maybe i should stop getting $20 haircuts because it definitely shows. i had her fix my neck line as well as get some random hairs that were missed. i'm a guy so i care much less about a bad cut because it'll grow back but man, it definitely is going to affect my decision to return."
"this place is awesome, basically i never had to wait more then 15min. to get a haircut. very friendly.never been disappointed with my haircut."
"i love my haircut! the hairdressers were very professional, and cut my hair exactly as i wanted. only problem was that i had to wait an hour and a half. but they were busy and i didn't call ahead."
"hi , i hardly give reviews but i had to for gina brown in the westwood shop , i used to go to a private barber but decided to try supercuts in westwood and met gina and i been using her for over 5 years , she knows exactly how i like my hair cut and because i have greyish hair and i hate it she does the perfect brown color on me every time , i will not use anybody but her , i think she is amazing and will continue to use her for as long as am around , see u in 3 weeks thank u gina ps: i dont understand why the bad reviews , she is always sweet and i think its unfair on what i saw written ,"
"i'm usually not satisfied with my haircuts and styling. so i don't often go get my hair done. but, i'm really glad i came to this supercuts. i got a fantastic haircut and am very satisfied. wait wasn't very long, but i checked in online. so that might have saved me some time. service was fantastic and the lady cutting my hair had a strong attention to detail. i didn't catch her name, but she had a tattoo on her chest. thank you supercuts for a wonderful haircut and you'll be seeing me again."
"the worsti took by 3 year old son there today, and i have never ever seen such pathetic service.lousyi feel bad for my son, i could have closed my eyes and done better.there are empty spaces and long and out shape.shame on you guys for hiring no experience person.last time for me"
absolutely worse experience and trash haircut i've ever received. i literally walked out mid cut. the lady (gina) who just cut my hair literally took about 10 minutes and was done. no edging or anything to clean up the little areas. she also went much higher after i told her twice not to go too high on my sideburns and actually pointed at where i wanted them. she said they were both the same length which clearly they aren't. had to go to a barber nearby and chose supercuts as only option because i'm away from my usual barber. attached are photos. i never leave reviews but this was crazy!
"the staff is friendly and facilities clean. however at the end of the day the review should be about the haircut- that is where supercuts in my experience always falls short. go in for a basic crew cut and they can't get it right ( hair sticks up in the back and is uneven on the sides of the head).as a national chain they have a lot of employees who only cut hair for a few years then move on- not the same steady hand or experience as a barber who's been doing it for a decade...yes they can cut your hair, but so can your 8 year old niece with kiddie scissors, you want a quality cut go to a barber"
"we walked in with my 4 year old son.  hoping for a little touch up around the ear and neck.  the young african american young lady we had, i think was working with out a license or cheated her way through beauty school.  she had no clue how to use the electrical scissors and make a straight line.  my son's left and right side burns don't match at all.  we told her nothing from the top and she cut the front of his hair so much and so uneven, he looks bald.  i'm literally in tears.  if it wasn't for my husband, i would go in the store screaming.  shame on you in that store"
"i am so fortunate that i walked out instead of letting gina cut my hair. consistent with other reviews, she immediately demanded to know what clipper guard to use and seemed shocked that i didn't want the clippers. when i started to explain how i wanted my hair cut, gina cut me off demanding to know how much to cut off. i told her that i wanted the length of the front of my hair to be 3 inches, and she said, ""i don't know what that means.""when somebody's rude, doesn't listen, and doesn't know what ""3 inch length in the front"" means, it's time to walk out. so i smiled and walked out while she glared at me. then i came on yelp and saw that gina has racked up 7 1-star reviews with consistent comments about how she doesn't listen and cuts poorly. i went to the supercuts on pico & sepulveda instead and got a fine haircut from ydera."
"this place absolutely butchered my hair.i've been going to supercuts for years in other cities. this was by far the worst haircut i've ever had. it was so bad, i refuse to go to a walk-in place from here on out. only salons for me. my experience: i walked in, and there was one lady sitting on the couch in the waiting area. one person ahead of me is typically not bad. i check in, and turns out the lady sitting on the couch was the stylist. she walked to a station with me, and had no clue what she was doing. she was scrambling to find razors and scissors. she even selected things out of the ""soiled"" drawer. it was evident she had never even cut hair before. unfortunately she already started the cut on me...without asking, she cut my sideburns completed off and turned them into a straight line from the top of my ear.... how is this even possible. i quickly realized this girl had never even been through proper training before. there were a number of other things, such as randomly blow drying me when she didn't need to, not offering a shampoo, not asking if i wanted the back square or round, and not knowing how to do a fade without leaving multiple lines. it is absolutely incredible someone like this was even allowed to cut hair. i am honestly considering shaving my head. my sideburns just look silly right now, and people have already told me so. no more chances for me. i'm paying for a salon from here on out.do not go to this location"
"my first time at this supercuts location. i stopped going because i had a lot of bad experiences with supercuts in the past so i was skeptical of giving them one more chance.. i came into the westwood location, was greeted kindly and waited a few minutes. this sweet lady gina gave me a haircut and it was amazing!!  it did not take long, and she fully understood what i was looking for!! i am very happy with my cut! i will def be back!! thanks gina!!"
this was the worst haircut ever. stay away!!!!  i did not see the reviews before but i wish i had. now i am stuck with a terrible cut. you cannot trust supercut chains anymore.
natasha is simply the best. i first met her at the pico location. i'm super picky about dying my mostly grey hair and each time she's done a fabulous job working with me to pick the color and then applying it beautifully. the color does not fade and the only downside is because my hair remains so healthy it grows out super fast
"thank you so much veronica, i was so scared to try supercuts but you gave me a wonderful hair cut, couldn't be happier. my spoiled beverly hills tushy will go to supercuts from now on. thank you v"
"the only place in la what was not completely booked. korian (koco) did a great job of making me feel comfortable and really trying to understand what i wanted in my haircut. my hair was already a bit short with a blunt cut at the end. she explained what she was doing, before cutting my hair, which i absolutely adored. no hairstylist had ever told me that i could get my hair layered and not cut off a couple inches off the ends! there's plenty of parking in the back, which i recommend. my haircut was around $20-25. if you are going here, call and book koco!!!"
"i had a great experience here, apart from the palpable hesitation when i told my stylist how short i wanted my hair. the service staff was friendly and helpful. and even though she kind of tried to talk me out of my idea, she was still very attentive to my desires and it worked out in the end. not sure why these reviews are low-- it's supercut, not a private salon. good experience though, i will probabaly be coming back"
"in this review, i refer to the supercuts on 1650 westwood blvd. los angeles, ca 90024 with the phone number 310-470-1558.awful, awful service at this store falsely calling itself supercuts.  i called the headquarters, and they said this location is not under the supercuts umbrella.  don't be fooled!both the stylist and the cashier had a nasty attitude, treating me with contempt and disrespect, and as if they were doing me a favor.  after this horrendous introduction, i received a sloppy haircut, and now my hair is unkempt.  i mentioned this experience to one of my friends, and she promptly told me that she had also received a bad haircut at this location.  i will never set foot into this store again; it is one of the worst experiences i have ever had.  1 star is far too generous."
"firstly i worked for supercuts for 25 years as a manager and educator , my daughter lives in westwood and needed her haircut , since i live in another city with  no equipment with me , i called ahead for a wash, cut and blow dry , it was clear the stylist did not want to do any blow drying today since she quoted me 35 additional dollars for a total of 61 dollars for my daughters shoulder length layers . 21 for the cut , 5 for the shampoo , and 35 for a simple blow dry ?, right...pure laziness . all those years i served my clients fairly with a smile and without complaint and to get this, truly infuriated me . so we walk out with wet hair when all we wanted was a simple blow dry not a extravagant updo , because there's no way i'm going to have someone with a bad work ethic rip me off ."
"i will not return to this location nor have gina a short mexican woman touch my head again. she did not listen to the instructions given to her, had to be told to cut around the ears, but did not trim the eye brows, plus did not comb my hair. charged me $21.00 then had the nerve to ask for a tip. i believe this woman belittled me with her colleagues  behind my back after i left the location. i recommend not to attend this location unless you have a established hair coiffure."
worst experience i have ever had at a supercuts with staff and professionalism and cut!!! i will never take my boys there again. both stylist were complaining about my boys hair to me . although one did a decent job cutting my son's hair gina was complaining about me in front of me in spanish to the other stylist not knowing that i understood every word! she didn't want to cut my son's hair and tried her best to mess it up! and at the end when i tipped both stylist although i was not happy with my experience and hair cut the lady who rang me up complaint about the 15% tip i left each!
"waited for 2 hours even though they said the wait was only 15 mins. shame on you! when it finally came time for the haircut, it was shockingly mediocre, yet not at all cheap. terrible place. would not recommend at all."
"first, get more than 3 dang parking spaces. second, lovely customer service from 3 younger short ladies. smiles and said hello when i walked in. it's all downhill from there folks, some lady who honestly was probably drunk, came straight to me for a haircut, skipping the little 16 year old who had been there before i (i came to find out). then she cut my hair trying to be as fast as lightning. i'm guessing she was off at 4:30 or something. she then scraped the back of my neck with the same buzzer she cut my hair with. i'm pretty sure you have trimmer you could've used. as my neck sits here and burns from the crappy cut i received. also, the line up is crooked anyway. rrrrghh, why did i leave a tip.."
"i loved this place. i didn't make an appointment, i just walked in, and i didn't wait very long (i got lucky). blanca trimmed my hair. i was so desperate for a cut. she fixed my hair right up! i love how much volume it has now. thank you so much! i will definitely return for my next cut! highly recommend this location!"
"good luck to anyone trying to get good service here! worst customer service i have experienced in a long time... and to top it off it's happened a few times (should've written this review a while ago, but have tried to give them the benefit of the doubt). good luck trying to call ahead and get an accurate account of how long it will take. sadly a few of the stylist do a great job of cutting mens hair but the device in trying to get to a chair is horrible!! tonight i tried to walk in and was happy to see at least two stylist i am familiar with... was told i could write my name down and it would be 45 min. so i go run errands and come back to have to wait again. *also one time a lady was either so incompetent or rude that she tried to give me a mo-hawk and when i tried to get her to fix it, she handed the machine and scissors to another stylist. they couldn't even really look me in the eye as i asked how long it would take. hate to be impatient but this has happened before when i need to catch a flight out of town and this was the last straw... my kids hadn't eaten dinner and although i really needed a haircut, i can't stand when people can't be curtiss enough to keep an ""appointment""."
"i called to make an appointment for my son. i was informed that they do not take appointments, just walk-ins. so i just took my son in after school... there's an hour wait. then she asks, ""do you want me to put you down for that time?""what?? ""i thought you don't take appointments,"" i said. ""well, we take call aheads,"" she said. ""and why didn't they tell me that when i called to try scheduling an appointment?"" i asked. ""i don't know.""ugh."
"horrible service celia is a horrible rude stylist if you can call her that , she has no manner she is rude to her customers especially if young , my son went in to get a cut he asked for a 2 then decided for a one she right away said w an attitude an intimidating tone "" you asked for a 2 "" sideburns?????long or short ? he was like huh , she said these long or short w an intimidating tone  as well , i complained to clerk and she said yeah she is rude ..... i say management get her out if you don't want health dept there as well due to unsanitary issues that were noted $18 dollars down the trash and a 13 yr old who said yes she was rude but what could i do ... she's an adult? because mind you i have taught my child to respect his elders but this lady should be let go please contact me for more info management ilozano1616@icloud.com"
"i moved out to downtown la a few years now and it's hard finding a great hair stylist. i decided to give supercuts in downey a try because of the rave reviews. i went in yesterday morning and i'm glad i did! i happen to get my hair cut by the stylist blanca (whom i read the great reviews about prior before). not only is she great.. she's fast, very friendly, and i absolutely love the style of cut she gave me!!! :dnot only am i excited for my new cut.. i appreciate the friendly staff, the reasonable price and how well organize they are with their valued customers..thank you blanca!!! you're awesome! definitely will be seeing me again for a next cut :)continue.. i came by tuesday, but blanca wasn't there! i took a risk in having joanna cut my hair.. and i'm glad a did! love my cute asymmetrical short bob! not only did you bring bounce to my hair, but i no longer feel self conscious in leaving my hair down. thank you joanna.. you're awesome!!!!"
"parking is a major issue with this location, and not making appointments.  you can call 45 minutes before to be put on the list.  i always like the cut.  usually we have the same stylist. they take mastercard and visa, but not american express."
"i will never go back to this place!!! i have never been humiliated in my life like i did !!!! i went yesterday because my 6 year old daughter needed a trim and i took my baby with me because i had called ahead of time and they told me they would have a stylist available as soon as i came in. while my daughter was getting her hair cut, my little one was walking around and i was supervising and making sure she didn't touch or get anything. the stylist joanna so rude told me to make sure the baby didn't touch the product, and really got upset because i was already watching her and shes just a baby. i felt shamed-mom, she yelled it out in front of everyone that was there. then another stylist opens the door knowing that i had my 1 year old and i asked her if we can close the door because didn't want her to run outside and get hit by a car. she told me she didn't care and that i should hold her. basically told me to tie her down like a animal. never again come back again!!!! i will be also contacting corporate office. what i don't understand why i was treat so poorly and still want my money !!!!  honestly i would want a refund!!"
"stylist are always a hit and miss and to top it off you always get someone new, for some reason they can hang on to employees here. the wait and the customer service are the worse!even if you call in ahead you are bound to wait at least 40min after your estimated wait time. i always try to give places a second,third chance and this specific time lace has always been bad! so i would suggest you try some where else to  have a better experience."
"update: called back the next morning and the manager blanca offered to fix my hair. i hurried over before leaving town and she repaired the mess that was done to my hair. because of the other lady, it was straight on the right side, slanted in the back and two different lengths on the left. she mentioned the lady that cut my hair said i wanted a slanted cut. well, her employee *lied* to her cause i specifically told her i wanted a simple straight bob. even if i did want a slanted cut, in what world does that mean straight and slanted in 4 different lengths?! anyway, the manager was friendly and gave me the perfect cut even though she had to trim it shorter than i initially wanted it, but it was necessary to fix it. couldn't be mad at her, not her fault another employee rushed through my hair and didn't care enough to make sure it was even. while i'm glad she fixed it, i still won't be returning. which is a shame cause i used to get my hair done here all the time years ago when i worked nearby.added one star since the manager made things right. had some issues reserving my appointment time on the website. kept getting an error so i just walked in. they said my time did go through and i was next. i wanted my bob trimmed & re-shaved in the back. i believe it was the supervisor on duty that cut my hair. she asked if i wanted shampoo and condition, i said yes so the shaved bits would be shampooed away from my hair. she sprayed down my hair then cut it at the right length i wanted. she showed me the back to make sure it was short enough. during the shampoo she asked if i would like a blowdry & style, i said yes but she said she didn't have time cause she wanted to take another customer to do a hair cut on him. what?! why? i was there first. asked me to wait 20 min so she could cut his hair then finish mine! i didn't want to sit around w/ wet hair so i declined. came home to dry it myself and noticed the cut is so uneven! one part is almost an inch longer than the rest. see the photo. worst hair salon experience ever!incomplete hair cut and unprofessional attitude! i only came here cause my usual stylist was busy the next few weeks. never again! now i'm going to have to try and even out the cut myself, and it's already short eno"
very disappointed i do not recommend this place. i came here looking to get a blunt over the shoulder haircut and i ended up with a mushroom bob. not only is it not what i asked for but it's also very uneven. now i have to wait until my hair grows out to recut it. i believe the lady that cut it was named ana but i have to double check. my hair is curly and i didn't notice how uneven it was until i got home to straighten it. now i'm stuck with a mushroom head. i rated 2 stars because she was friendly and minimal wait time but the cut she gave me is really bad. if you must go to this location i would suggest a different stylist for this type of cut. i am adding pics for reference.
"i love this spot! i keep my hair super short with a tight fade and let me just say blanca can get that done in a quarter of the time it use to take my barber to do it. i always check in on-line cause it's easier to reserve your spot. with the reservation i may wait no more than 5 minuets once i arrive. keep in mind, this place is always busy, which speaks volumes at how good these girls are. in addition to the good service, it's always a good time chatting with these girls. they are all super cool and funny but most importantly efficient. i've now turned several friends (male & female) on to this spot. so far we've all been good. thanks again ladies and see you in a week!"
"i have been a customer for this location for years. they have great staff, clean salon, great customer service. i started using the online reservation which saves me time because they are a very busy store. defiantly try their tea tree experience. highly recommended. a++"
this is a great place to get your hair cut.  the service and people are very nice.  blanca is awesome!
"i love their service, i came in and blanca huke me up.. i came out looking very pretty. thank you so much. she's the best. come to super cuts you wont regret it. money worth spend! thank u"
"extremely rude, uneducated so called stylist. joanna rodriguez has the worst attitude. she acts like she is doing you a favor by cutting you hair. someone should really pay more attention on how customers get treated at this super cuts location. i did not even get the haircut i wanted because of how uncomfortable she made me feel. i just wanted her to get her hands off my hair already. i strongly suggest you to go to the one on lakewood."
"these girls are amazing! each & everyone of them. they are dedicated to their customers and service. super helpful. they listen to the customers needs. i have to admit my first initial visit was rough but for some reason these girls are awesome and aren't the same. totally personable. yes the wait is long, but that's expected. why rush especially on a hair cut? please don't rush on me. i will be back :)"
"i used to go here a little, but that's until the last woman who cut my hair about 8mos ago, left a huge long piece of hair without cutting it. i didn't even notice til i got out the shower and combed my hair out. how the heck can you possibly miss that? never going back. plus, they take forever, and that's probably because they are too busy talking and not cutting hair. no thanks."
got my hair cut and colored and blanca did an awesome job and color came out perfect!!  the store is clean and all the staff is very friendly totally recommend!
"let me preface this by saying that i have been getting my hair professionally highlighted and colored since i was a preteen and am now 29.  also, please note the pictures i have included. i wish i could include the sinking feeling i have walking in public but my lengthy review will have to do. i am naturally blonde but have enjoyed keeping my hair super light with some slightly darker (medium brown) undertones... or as i was informed by one of the stylists are ""low lights."" well, i showed them 4 pictures of extremely blonde hair as the reference for how light i wanted my hair and one photo with the blonde & slightly contrasted shades alongside the blonde. long story short, my hair turned out way darker than when i walked in. it is currently a light brown from the light blonde that i was. i was charged $220+tip for a bunch of stuff i didn't agree to (deep treatments and 2 other things that were never explained to me). i was so upset that i couldn't formulate my questions right and every single girl who worked there made me feel worse by saying that it was my fault for getting low lights, that that is the reason my hair is now brown. no one had a consultation with me. no one showed me a sample of what colors they would be using. no one told me prices and when i asked, the response was ""we'll have to see..."" they made me feel so bad for coming in at 3:45p on a saturday, too.   (i left at about 7:15) i felt unbelievably uncomfortable because they made t known that they were so busy and that their manager who scheduled my appointment messed up by saying okay to me. two girls worked on my hair but neither of them told me what they were going to do. then every single girl was rude, defensive, and accusatory towards me about how dark my hair turned out. i feel so gross about how my hair looks (even though they kept saying ""it's beautiful! it's beautiful"")... i can't come back to have it ""fixed"" because i will be undergoing a surgery and out of commission for 3 weeks (which is after the amount of time that they will fix it)... and they won't refund me for the insane amount of ""extras"" that they added to my bill without my knowledge. i wouldn't have agreed to paying it in the beginning if i wasn't told that the manager could probably refund a portion of the bill and if it wasn't past closing when i left (i was so disappointed and shooken up that i couldn't even argue the price with them.). just be extreeeemely careful if you have naturally light hair and want highlights.  i can't get over how poorly these people treated me. from beginning to end i felt uncomfortable then disappointed and now like someone stole from me. i usually spend my money on high end salons like luigi bruni in michigan and charles ifergan salon in chicago but this is my mistake for trusting a low grade hair place like supercuts.  and when i mentioned what my cousin (miriah from charles ifergan salon) said about this places process, the rude manager, blanca, shut me down and said that everyone does hair differently so her opinion doesn't matter. well, hers does considering she's a upstanding colorist that makes supercuts look like the lowest grade hair establishment. don't go here.if they make a mistake you will have to pay... quite literally... and you will pay the price of an actual upscale salon that makes you feel good about yourself... now embarrassed."
every time i walk out of this store my hair is healthy and beautiful. blanca's been doing my hair the last couples times and she's a great. amazing colorist! very nice and professional :)
"i didn't have time to go to my person for a haircut so i went to supercuts by my work.  ana cut my hair and she did a great job!  the only downside is that they are very busy and only two stylist were there and they have to stop what they are doing to either answer a call or speak to a walk-in.  supercuts, you need an receptionist for your stylist but overall, ana is the person to go to for a great haircut.  gina jackson"
"i walked in yesterday 15 minutes before closing and i was told that i was going to be serviced. the 2 stylist finished with their customers at the same time. neither one wanted to approach me or acknowledge me. i stood up and walked towards them. i said i'll just come back tomorrow since you're closing. neither one said sorry or thank you. i've been there before business hours and let's just say that they've opened late before. if you're gonna open your business late, do you think it's a good idea not wanting to provide services to late walk ins. the only bad outcome for me leaving this location is that i won't be helped by ana. ana gives the best haircuts. shame!"
"just got the worst hair cut off my life. they forgot to fade half the side of my head, so it looks like i'm wearing a hat. had to pay $50 so someone can come to my house at 9pm to fix this, because i can't got into the office like this. likely going to appeal on credit card, this is ridiculous."
"went in today with my boyfriend, he got his haircut by philip. when asked to cut the top a little shorter, he immediately corrected my boyfriend. he was very rude, normally the staff is very welcoming and super nice. avoid philip at all costs."
1st time having my twins get their hair cut @ a super cuts because it's difficult apparently to just trim ends when their hair is down to their waist ... but not for ana ... she did an amazing job and didn't rush . she was very pleasant and my twinkies loved her as well . we will definitely be back because of her great customer service and professionalism .  thanks for the great experience ana !
"yea it's nice with the app and all, but if i'm going to pay almost $30 for a haircut i'd expect them to at least have a 7"""
"the young lady with short hair who cut my hair was very nice and outgoing but the she did a terrible job cutting my hair. 7 people now have made fun of my haircut, heck even my 10 year old son made fun of my crappy haircut. the cut is so bad that i considered buzzing my hair. i will never cut my hair at supercuts and i'm disappointed that a place this ""reputable"" has such crappy ""hair stylists"""
five stars for phillip who not only gave me one of the best haircuts i've had in a long time but also gave me some great tips for making my thin limp hair appear fuller. i even bought a product at his recommendation (a root lifter) which i never do and so far i love it!
"don't understand the concept of appointments... i called m made an appointment in advance and was given one for 3:20pm, get there at 3:10. my stylist was still finishing up with someone so i waited. he then calls the person who walked in after me. so i asked them if it was gonna be a while, i was told i had to check-in once i got to the salon, so i checked in and was told i'll be next. but a guy who just walked in with no appointment was attended to at 4:15 , while i have been waiting for almost an hour. trust me as a small business owner i'm the last person to leave a feedback like this, but i don't appreciate a business who don't value their customers time. i won't be coming back here again nor would i recommend anyone to go there...."
"elle (or el) probably is the worst stylist i've ever met. she seemed like she just had drugs or something, very frustrated by the hair on the ground, she kept complaining and using a blowdryer to blow the hair away. she's impatient, unfriendly, and of course my hairstyle is ruined with an uneven edge. i'll never visit this store again."
"5 stars to alfredo - 3 stars this locationnot to knock the other stylists but alfredo has been the only one who consistently give me a cut as i expected.  i may be bias but i feel my request is closer to the simple spectrum, i've had other stylists shave off my sideburns leaving an awkward gap between my head and beard.  he pays attention to detail and something he does that i never expect out of anyone is he remembers who you are and details about you and your life.the store i give a lower score to because not only do they charge a higher rate the my older supercuts but they also tack on a $2 ""request"" fee.  honestly no one would be requesting if everyone delivered.to be fair the 3 people that had given me a bad cut haven't been at this location for quiet some time but i'm in no hurry to replace alfredo."
"had to get my whole head shaved at the end of the cut because some woman who works there doesn't understand a crop goes down, not up like a pseudo-mohawk a 7th grader would have. it was just completely unacceptable, and the woman was beyond rude, rolled her eyes countless times and was completely careless. i will literally never go to another supercuts again. just shell out the extra $20 to go to floyd's or better yet support your local shop, your hair is worth it. i could have done a better job on my own using a lawnmower."
"five stars just for yoko alone! i wasn't blown away by my first cut here months ago, but tonight i had the luck to get yoko for the first time. she was absolutely meticulous and very skilled on my long unruly hair.at supercuts, the basic haircut (priced here at $21.95; locations vary) usually do not come with a wash unless you pay for it (the wash-plus-cut package here is $25.95), so they usually only wet your hair with a spray bottle before cutting. yoko saw my mane condition, and instead of just spraying my hair down, she took me to the back sink area to fully wet my hair as well as apply conditioner and later detangler so that she could get a better cut.be warned that this supercuts location is very busy, and their online ""check-in"" (which holds your spot in line remotely) wasn't working tonight, so i called in and was told it was a 40 minute wait. it ended up being more like a 60 minute wait, but i stopped in and then came back again. the good thing is that the clientele here is almost all male so their cuts go pretty quick with the two stylists yoko and monica here, even when there are three people in front of you.special requests for a stylist cost an extra $2, but may be worth it for yoko. monica is also pretty good, but yoko goes the extra mile!tip: right now there is a $2 coupon online for one-time use when you sign up for the supercuts emails for this location."
"they made us wait for an hour and a 1/2 but told us 45 minutes wait. didn't apologize. my son had long hair and wanted to cut his pony tail. he went from long hair to short hair but hairdresser wouldn't allow us to photograph it even though i promised hair dresser wouldn't be in frame. such bad attitude. then she butchered his hair and it had uneven lines. i should have known she was terrible from the cheap dye that covered her middle age grays ,epic fail trying to look like a millennial."
"don't go here, you'll be ripped off. bad customer service and even worst hair cut service. overpriced and unhappy workers. the front desk lady needs an attitude check. going back to the barber shop because this place is garbage."
"thanks to sarah for my shampoo, haircut & blow dry. another thanks to ceci for recommending me. they both made me feel comfortable, inviting & very relaxed. i was unsure if i wanted to show up due to losing a lot of hair after my 2nd pregnancy but they reassured me that i had nothing to worry about. nor did i need to feel embarrassed. as one of their first time clients they couldn't have treated me any better. thank you girls! until next time."
i have to write a review after phillip literally made a whole in my son forehead . my son ask for a faded haircut . his hairline is back about 1 inch . my 10 years old was so upset . can't be fixed so at least i got my money back . will never go to a supercut salon
the wait was short considering i walked in around 5:30 pm and elle was fantastic. i haven't gotten a haircut in about two years so naturally i was nervous but she did a wonderful job. i would definitely return.
"this location is always understaffed, leading to long wait times. stylists are qualified but whomever sets the schedules is obviously oblivious to the fact that customers are not being served ina reasonable amount of time. one should not have to wait an hour to get a haircut at a supercuts."
so i've been coming to this supercuts for many years and there's only one person who i will allow to touch my hair and that's ana! she is is the greatest when it comes to cutting hair! she listens to what you want and how you want it and she will ask you step by step if it's okay or if that's how you want it! i recommend this place if you need a quick hair cut but ana is your go to girl!
"honestly, i usually always go to the bigger salons. but it was a sunday and i needed a ""trim""(like 5 inches kinda cut). they were fast, professional and good. i'll come again for my trim. happy they're around."
"three attempts here before i'm moving on. stylists, on the whole, seem outwardly pleasant and helpful, but the atmosphere is not managed. by the nature of the business, walk-in clientele are on parity with those taking the opportunity to""check-in"" prior to arrival, meaning if you have a time given you when calling or online, treat it as a nice gesture. thee is no such obligation to honor it here. want an appointment so as to work around your life, go elsewhere. fair enough. want to attempt to manage time here, forget it. there is no real incentive for checking in when others can come in off the street ahead of you based upon a complex algorithm only the reception staff know. i want to like this place. however, if waiting 45 minutes on average is a problem for you, then move to a place with an appointment system and develop a relationship with a stylist that is harmonious with your needs."
"jose, the manager, is amazing! i wanted my hair shaved, but still feminine looking. i had a photo with me, and he completely ""nailed"" it! this is a cut i was just about to pay $85 for at my regular salon, but i took a chance while waiting for my husband to get his haircut.i couldn't be happier with the results. in addition, jose and i had such a good time while he ""nailed"" each section. the most impressive part is that he walked me through what he would do before approaching each sectioni'll be back!!!!!"
they open at 8:00am and are conveniently located downtown. very few places are open this early. this is a great way to get a cut before work.
"my new dtla spot for haircuts. priced well, service is awesome, jose is rad and always take the time to listen and understand what im looking for. quick, clean and relaxed atmosphere. im always a walk-in but they seem to find room for me in a timely fashion."
kim does a great job every time i come here. two thumbs up for service and two thumbs way up for listening.
"i am a student and needed to keep my costs down so when i arrived i asked how much it would be for a haircut and they told me $26. the stylist took me to my seat and asked if i would like my hair blowdried telling me i would be charged $30 and if i wanted my hair shampoo'd to she would charge me $6. i expected the total to come to $36 but received a bill for $62. i was surprised and asked how it jumped so high and they became defensive, telling me i was told of the prices. i do not feel they were very clear.  i would never in a million years expect to pay more for a blow-dry than the haircut.  they should have been clear and when i asked about it, i didn't appreciate their defensiveness. i called corporate and the owner was supposed to call me but never bothered. i would have been a returning customer if this hadn't happened but not now."
"so my barber of 3 years up and quit without telling me so i was left without a stylist. searched yelp for locations in downtown, surprisingly supercuts had the best reviews by far. took a chance and had allison cut my hair, wow i was impressed! she did an amazing job! definitely returning, the cut, the fade and the blending she did on my simple 1940s combover is impeccable!"
"price is a little higher then where i'm from but understandable for being dtla. jose did my hair and did an amazing job, great to talk with. very fast service with online check in"
"i came in for a small haircut and a trim on my bangs. erika wtf is this. seriously dude she just went ham on my bangs for $26. prices went up by the way, it's no longer $23"
alison is absolutely awesome! my friend who did my hair for me moved away and i've been bouncing salons and stylists since then. i mostly do my own hair (mediocrily) so my trips are few and far between. i first went to alison a couple months ago and she was the first to actually give me a cut i left happy with. since i had a good experience the last time i came back to her today and she remembered me and bits of our conversation from months ago. her personal approach and great conversation keeps me coming back. (plus the fact that she knows how to cut the way i like it). highly recommend!
"called in about 2p saturday to make an appointment for a shampoo, cut and style for my long, course curly hair. i'm pretty bold when it comes to my hair. i've shaved it, bleached it on my own, colored it own my own, had pretty much ever color in the rainbow on my hair. for the last four or so years, i've kept it natural from dyes and only trim. aside from using protective styles (braids) i really haven't done anything drastic to my hair...that is until 3 weeks ago. bored at home, i decided to cut my own bangs. what a failure that was! my hair is curly when i cut them and when i straighten it it looked horrible. when i made my appointment, i was assigned to allison who was totally understanding of my hair experiment. she was talkative, energetic and incredibly friendly during my visit. jose was also there being the vibrance of the salon. at the end of my cut and style, allison made my hair look absolutely incredible!! received lots of compliments on her work that evening. wow!!! so ecstatic with the result!!! she really has the magic touch. 10/10 would recommend. thanks allison!!"
"two thumbs up for jose. efficient, clean, careful, and precise with his cuts. he always follow instructions perfectly to the way i want my hair cut"
"i've been coming to supercuts for about 2-3 years now. hopped around a few times to other salons and barbershops, but none were as consistent, friendly, and fast as supercuts. i didn't mind who cut my hair in this location because all cuts ended up surpassing my expectations. recently walked in just to get my sides and back cut to a 1. jose spent extra time and care, and at one point, i swear he was about to strain his eyes focusing on my fade! i felt as if he used 7 different tools to cut my hair. love my cut and obviously will be back."
they did bad haircut on my son! they don't ask for details about hair cut. i am very disappointed from their service and never going back to any supercuts again!!
came here on a monday afternoon and it was very busy but the workers move quickly and i found myself with a cool cut pretty quickly. they really took their time to help me look good. the app to check-in is helpful as it can minimize wait time if you check in before you show up. it is a bit pricier than a great clips or fantastic sams but i feel you get what you pay for. i was happy with the cut and will be returning
"keep in mind that i can only speak to the eyebrow waxing service, but the whole experience has always been positive for the past 2+ years for me. diana is forever and always my favorite--she is so sweet and fast yet everything looks exactly as i like it. i have huge naturally arched eyebrows and prefer to just get them cleaned up a little bit than to get the spider eyebrows that i was always envious of and wanted back when they were in style in 2002. that being said, this location only really does ""clean ups"" and not so much styling/definition. for me, as this is all i want done, the end result has always been comparable to whenever i've gone to some fancy spa for $30+ per wax. the timing is fine, i've gone all different times of the day/afternoon and am always in and out in 30 minutes total."
"couldn't find another place on short notice to get my hair done. the place is nice not really busy. the girl that cut my hair did a good job i think her name was wona. i think their pricing for color is stupid. my hair barely goes to my shoulders and they charged me the most expensive price for ""long hair"" the prices are no better than other salons in downtown so all in all if you are in a rush and can't get an appointment for another place it works."
"i always use kim when i head into this location. she is wonderful! i've become a regular because of her service and consistent haircut. wait times vary, but i've never waited longer than 20 minutes.  parking is street only or if you use the grocery store next door, you can get it validated for 90 minutes free. that's always my move."
"i would love to give a shoutout to my favorite hair stylist jose, for always perfecting my hairstyle and entertaining me with all jokes while getting my hair look flawless. he is undeniably professional and the finish always look the way i wanted. i have had many great customer experiences with them as jose has been my most favorite stylist for almost three years now. if anyone wants to get their hair done right, jose is the right hairstylist i would highly recommend you! although there are some other nice stylists, he is just exceptional and fun!xoxo."
"nice place. my reservation is always honor. mara my stylist, was born on my birthday also. she does a good haircut, as requested. always look forward to the hot towel finish. there is a super cuts app, you can download. i always use it. good place."
"absolute worst customer service ever!  i decided to give it another try as the last nightmare stylist was no longer there.   so i go in for a simple quick hair shampoo again and the woman who washes my hair tells me not come back again because she is ""not allowed "" to scrub my head harder and give 3 shampoos because it is a waste of her time and energy!!!!!!  r e a l l y?????  no class or professionalism at supercuts fort lee.  never again!!!! boycotted for good!!!! doesn't even deserve one star but had to write this review"
i usually get cuts color and hair treatments here for past 4 years and all the girls are friendly and they all are professionally experienced. they know what they're doing and what customers want. great easy location too
claudiana rocks! my husband and 2 year old son go to her and she does a great job every time. i'm not crazy about their way of taking appointments but that's not her fault. she always has people waiting for her and she does a great job organizing her clients while giving great customer service. i hope she stays forever!
"trashy example of customer service. ive been taking my kids to supercuts in hackensack but their stylist was not there, so i went to fort lee's location and checked in online and it said no wait. i get there and i get a rude introduction. apparently, if youre russian, youll receive preferential treatment. once the stylist finished the previous customer, she takes a crazy amount of time to get the guy on his way. at 40 minutes, i stood up and told my son to lets go. here she comes..... im coming, hold on! and shes shouting as were walking out! needless to say, my 2 year old was not amused with this crackpots attitude. im disappointed in supercuts as a brand and for hiring that waste of oxygen."
"terrible service. staff is terrible. they are rude and insulting. the only person i enjoyed moved to hackensack and i tried going after, but they are just so rude. i will never go back again."
cheap. rather dirty. ever hairdressers themselves. don't have haircuts. $14 bucks for a haircut. had to wait for 45 min.go elsewhere if you anything more than low price.
"i walked in 30 minutes before closing to get a haircut and was taken care of by alyssa, who said she's been working here for seven years. even though i have a short and simple hairstyle, she did a great job and only took fifteen minutes! i was so impressed that i made a yelp account to write this review. will go here again."
i took my son in for a haircut and it came out totally wrong not how i pictured it or in the magazine photo which i've shown to the stylist. back of the head groomed and trimmed nicely but what happened to the front or side profile? we were pressed for time for another appointment therefore couldn't fix the problem. alyssa cut my son hair very quickly that day. i don't think i'll be returning to super cut any time soon.
"get your story straight. elizabeth made me have two people cut front of me who didn't have appointments with yin that day because i refused to get a haircut with her last min on the walk in. she straight up lied and said that guy called in advance and yin confirmed that guy didn't call or did he even ask for her. she made me wait because i denied her that day after i said yes to her at first and then declined because i remembered the previous garbage haircut i got from her about a month ago. the fade was so bad, i could seriously do it better with two mirrors. you want pictures? cause i have it. after i got the hair cut, i walked to my car and realized it was so messed up, i walked back in so that she could fix it . to make it even more entertaining, i went home took a shower and it was still fked up. i took a picture for humor.  false review ? again the 2nd visit: i made the appointment on the app after i declined and made it with yin. i was the next person to get a haircut and magically two walk ins that came after me got a haircut with directly with yin. ( yin had no appointments besides me) the reason was that the guy "" called "" which was a lie by elizabeth cause the guy who actually called for a walk in (not request for yin) came in about 40'mins after that walk in guy got the hair cut with yin. there was like 4 people cutting hair and 2 of those girls just standing around. why did elizabeth straight up lie and put the 2 walk in that didn't request yin with yin and the best part the walk in that came after me didn't even call( wrong person), while i was clearly waiting for her for and only her ? and while 2 other girls just talking and doing nothing ? what is your name? let's escalate this. you either have to be elizabeth or just ignorant and you don't have a clue what the heck is going on."
"worst haircut i've ever had in my life.i question this person's credentials about cutting hair...she just pulled out the trimmer, played around with my head, then used a scissor (3 slices). down... took 5 minutes or less.i didn't even want to pay for this, i actually had to go to another barbershop, to get precise cuts after. she failed every category within cutting hair. do not come here."
"i like that they have the same stylists working there for years. my favorite ones are donna and patricia. my only complaint is that this location is so popular the lines are sometimes long (call beforehand to put your name down). also, the last two times my haircuts turned out to be asymmetrical, which luckily gained me lots of compliments. i tried edgewater location for a change, but it was a disaster, so i'm coming back to fort lee. also, fort lee location is corporate so employees get health benefits, which is important for me from social compliance point of view.supercuts are great for wash and haircut only. anything more, and it gets more expensive and rushed than regular salons."
will never go to this supercuts again. asked for a 1 inch trim on my hair and received about 3 inches off which is fine. then the lady proceeded to try and give my front layers without my permission. the end result was an extremely uneven haircut. i'm not sure what she was trying to do because i do not have layers or a face frame at all. it looks like she just decided to chop an inch off without angling it at all. other pieces at the back are also unevenly cut.
"i check in on line, jen hooked me up, took the time and put the workmanship i expect when i get cut up.  thanks, i will be back next time i am in the area."
"had a 6:30 appt and waited for a half hour. i walked out without getting my haircut.  i wasn't waiting for anyone in particular so there were two women free. one just stared at me from the back of the store after she was done cutting a young man's hair. then once the other women freed up she spent about 20 minutes ringing up a customer because the reception girl was not competent enough to ring up a customer. instead she just kept yapping away with a person who wasn't even a customer. this place is awful, they are lazy and rude. i could understand if i was waiting for someone to finish up but they had no customers for a half hour while i waited way past my appt time."
"i was going to the supercuts in fort lee because jen was there and she was their best stylist in my opinion. well, she no longer works there. i was told by ""management"" that she quit. she's the only stylist who i'll allow to cut my hair. if anyone knows what happened, please post it here and if jen is working somewhere else please post that info here too. i would like to know and so would her loyal customers. thanks."
"with supercuts, you never know how good the skills of the person cutting your hair is going to be. this doesn't concern me too much as my needs are simple and the rare bad haircut grows out pretty quickly. what irks me about this supercuts is that on two separate occasions the person checking me in neglected to tell me that there was an hour's worth of customers ahead of me who had called in. (there were only a couple of people waiting in the store.) after a 40 minute wait today i mentioned it to the employee and she then told me i still had a wait. when i suggested the wait time could have been communicated when i first came in she rolled her eyes. at that point i left. there are lots of other places to get a cheap haircut without having to encounter a long wait and an attitude."
"this place is great for my needs.  i think when people come here they can't expect a lot.  if you really cared about how your hair really looked then you wouldn't be coming here.  let's face it if you are coming here, you are coming here to save money and that's it.  my haircut is easy to cut and for 14 bucks it's perfect.tips, call about an hour in advance and have them put your name down.  this will make the wait a lot shorter."
"this is a nice supercuts but this review is for their stylist, melissa.  i've been coming to her since november. she is a very good listener, understands how i want my hair cut, and is a joy to be around.  she cut my husband's hair as well and he was also very pleased.  i finally found someone i can trust at an affordable price!  i have a very short haircut and it's a struggle to make it look feminine and she nails it every time.  love her :-)"
"having written this nice review below, i got butchered by my regular barber here. god, i look like hell. :-("
"amazing experience. mimi, the woman who cut my hair was very friendly and made me feel at home. my hair came out better than i could have imagined. i liked the product she used in my hair and she even gave me a discount."
always take good care of me & family.  nothing pretentious.occasionally i get coupons & hair products on sale a lot.no complaints!!!
"so i went here on a whim a few days ago while shopping bc i really needed my hair cut but with christmas around the corner i really didn't wanna spend that much on just a trim so i saw this place and one of the girls was available, megan. she was so nice! so sweet & so good! i got a blunt cut & honestly was a little worried i'd notice some unevenness days later (bc blunt cuts are actually harder bc u can't hide it in layers) but i didn't it's amazing! i will be goin back that's for sure love this place! not to mention super clean too!! awesome thanks again!"
great experience. place was clean and had a good vibe. most importantly got a perfect hair cut. happy that i found a place so close to where i work. definitely will be coming back
"i had a great experience at this salon! megen was accommodating, professional, and creative! i had no wait time and walked out with the perfect hair style. i highly recommend megen and this salon location! you won't be disappointed!"
great place! everyone is so nice & friendly! i called ahead and didn't have to wait ( i loved that) megan cut my hair perfect! she is so sweet and very friendly and easy to talk to. i will definitely be back!!
"i am taking back my good review for supercuts in upper montclair. it was very upsetting to hear they pushed my hairdresser out. mark is a great hairdresser. he was excited to get an opportunity for advancement last time i got my hair done. he was then overlooked for his promotion.very upsetting.the managers in this place always have unhappy faces and act like they are doing you a favor. mark always has positive vibe. he acts like you are the most important person when you get your hair done. i asked him why he was rejected for his promotion. the manager of the nj area told him he was not fast enough. that is a complete lie. he does my face frame in a very short time. it's always perfect. the other hairdressers take over a half hour and never get it perfect. another friend of mine told me he gets his hair done in 5 minutes.  i recently found out he goes here too. he was also very upset when i told him.when i came in to get my haircut, mark was working with a girl who could not do the face frame correctly. he came over and fixed it for her. he was very professional and worked with her as a team player. he did not make her feel any less qualified in the way he went about it. those were great management skills. ever since i have been so happy. every time i get my hair cut i get compliments from everyone after my haircut. even strangers at the supermarket.i came to find out that many other people i know have discovered mark. he has a big following.i have been going to this location for years. every time i get a good hairdresser they leave. i had started with danielle who left. david was my previous hairdresser. he also left and moved to a high end salon which i can not afford. i found out he comes to get his haircut with mark too!!so mark wanted to stay and make this job a career. it helped local people to have a great hairdresser for an affordable price in this bad economy. life is hard enough. now i have to deal with this!"
"i called early on a saturday morning, seeing if i could get an appointment, and i was able to come right in for the first appointment that same day for a dye and trim.  this was huge for me because i have a pretty busy schedule and can't always make appointments so far in advance.  the staff was courteous and professional, the place was very clean and they did a great job on my hair.  i will definitely go back.  highly recommend!"
"i know it's a $15 haircut, but does it really have to be that difficult? have been going to his location for over a year and they used to be really good. however lately something has changed. this upper montclair supercuts location now has everything: bad service and incompetence. horrible attitudes by staff. like mcdonalds but with haircuts. there are so many competitors and other supercuts locations with hair stylists that take pride in their work unlike this location. unless you prefer crappy service and bad haircuts i don't recommend this upper montclair location."
"great salon, clean, and efficient. i used to come here all the time until my schedule changed.vera did a great job with my haircut!"
i loved the way alex cut my hard to manage hair. now she has moved elsewhere. would be great if anyone can forward her my email so that i can find her.
"we walked in there at 6:40 pm and were told that they were closing at 7 and couldn't take anymore haircuts. i explained that there was still 20minutes left and the cut was for my son who is 5 and takes about 10 minutes to cut his hair. they then told me that there was another person waiting but when that person said he wasn't actually getting a haircut (was waiting with someone else) the woman reluctantly said she would take my son. while my son was getting his haircut another hairdresser berated me for showing up so close to closing time and that their policy was not to take customers 1/2 before closing. he explained that there is a lengthy process to cleaning up and shutting down (aka we are lazy, hate that we actually cut hair at supercuts and want to be out of here at 7 pm sharp). it was clear that he was being nasty after getting a lousy tip from a previous client which he loudly complained about just moments earlier. i told him that there was no clear explanation about this alleged policy on the website and he told me i needed  to be more prepared. thanks for the life lesson mr supercuts and i am sorry that this will be the only job as a hairstylist you'll ever get. on a side note, my son's haircut sucked and the woman barely cut anything off. stay far away from this supercuts.. agree with other reviews aboit incompetence and horrible attitudes. they have major chips on their shoulders and take it out on customers."
very friendly atmosphere. unlike it used to be. its a convienet spot based on where i live. with the new staff came a new upbeat atmosphere. great place. great cut!
"i've been here four times and i've had excellent haircuts every time. a special shout out to vera, lily and cara. shop is clean and the staff is friendly."
"my worst haircut ever!! the young lady who cut my hair spent almost an hour and obviously she has no idea how to do the job right, i need a wig for at least two months.never this place again!!!"
"great for what it is.  this is not a high end salon, no do they claim to be.  plenty of stylists are always working, i lucked out and got one that i like, however i'm pretty sure you can request someone specific if you like.  it is very clean and everyone is very nice. can't beat the price for the results. they do not take appointments but if you call ahead they will put your name on the list."
wow. i feel like i should have paid them more for the haircut and color they gave me. it was one of the best i have ever had. jordyn (sp?) was my stylist and she was amazing. she listened to me. she talked me through everything she was doing. she created a custom color for me that was the best i have had. people can't stop raving about my amazing a-line bob. i adore this girl and will totally be back!
"worst place. i don't ask for much when i get my hair cut, just a basic trim with layers. this time around, i was told that she ""won't cut my hair like that"" and cut it the way she thought was best. i explained i've had the same cut for years, and she said that she refused to cut it that way and if i wanted a cut, it would be a basic trim. i could not believe how rude and unprofessional my experience was, and given that my hair now resembles a wet dog, i definitely won't be coming back."
"dont' let a girl named sasha get within a mile's radius of your hair. not sure it she still works there, but she could make a lawn cry after mowing it. to add insult to injury, she has a hard time listening and following the customer's requests. somebody please form a coalition and stop her!"
"they ruined my hair.  i will never be going back here.  they dyed my hair with black permanent hair dye (jet black) when i asked for a semi permanent dark brown.  they messed up and tried to add more brown tones, but they dried out my hair, it turned red.  service is terrible, they gossip about their customers (they spoke about me when they were doing my hair, two stylists were whispering nasty things about my hair).  just rude.  and expensive!  don't let that one dollar sign on this yelp page confuse you.  i have long hair, but to wash, color, trim and blow out my hair costed me $200.  go to bangz, they're (surprisingly) cheaper, cleaner, friendlier and they know what they're doing!"
"this is near my work so i like to come in for a trim on occasion (that being twice now). i've had good experiences both times. when i went there was no wait, but there was only one hairdresser working, so if you come at a time like that you can get stuck waiting for a while.granted it took longer than i expected, but my hairdresser was very thorough. my hairdresser (lindsey according to recepit) was friendly and took the time to cut my layers and make it look really nice. it wasn't much of a change length wise but it got rid of the heaviness of my hair without drastically changing it. and the price is definitely good. i can't speak to more complicated style proficiency, but it's good for what i need and it's next to some shopping and some eateries so it's easy to squeeze it in while running errands."
"oh my god are they slow. if you've got an hour or two, probably a good place to get your hair cut. check in online, if not people that come in will keep getting called in front of you. not a problem normally, but since they cut hair in slow motion...it's a must."
"i walked in without an appointment so i didn't mind the wait. while i waited i went on yelp to peek at the reviews. was a little skeptical seeing the more recent reviews since they were negative. ashley cut my hair and she did a great job. she was friendly to talk to and did exactly what i asked for. the other girls there seemed nice but i can only speak for the one who cut my hair. i'd happily return, can't beat the price!"
i came in for the blow dry and while people were super nice they had no idea how to do simple blow dryi left with flat hair that looks like i have asked my baby sister to do it and they put tons of oil on it so will have to wash it as soon as i get home...
"stephanie, was a very sociable kind worker that took time on me and my boyfriend hair. very friendly and great personality."
"i get a very simple haircut. 3 on the sides, 4 on top, straight across at the ears. my haircut was exactly like i wanted. the store was clean and well lit. the stylist was polite and quick."
"whoaaa dhaval...!! thats exactly opposite of who marquita is. one of the best hair stylist i have ever seen. she is very friendly, takes her time and very professional. she suggested some products for my hair and turns out they suite best for me. i have been going here from past one year and always had best experience with marquita. highly recommend her people who are going for the first time!"
"needed a nice haircut for an upcoming holiday party. walked in and got a stylist named marquita. best cut ever! the girl's got skills. she was way cool and very professional. i had to write a review because i don't know what dhaval d is talking about. people might read that and go in with the wrong attitude. marquita took her time and was extremely friendly and thorough. you can tell that she loves what she does and takes it seriously. she also played great music the whole time. long story short, i look like a f&@king stud. totally going back to her."
rude and unprofessional.  the employees would rather converse/gossip with one another than do their job.  i've been there 3 times (only because the haircuts are relatively inexpensive) and something went wrong with each visit.  i won't be going back.  don't waste your time or money going to this establishment.
"worst choice ever!!! got one star because they need it in order to write the review.   brought my 12 yr old son to get a trim and patricia starts cutting his hair with obviously no clue on what she was doing.  the 2nd hairdresser takes her scissors away from her and starts cutting his hair.  i felt better as it was obvious the first one didn't know what she was doing. but then people came in and the 2nd one left him to take a new client.  patricia tells me he's done, he puts on his hoodie, i pay, tip patricia and when i get home this is atrocity he was left with.    a 3 yr old child with scissors on his hand for the first time would've done a better job.  the head looks like if it's split in half with double the amount of hair on one side.    it's obvious, that if this so called hairdresser thinks thats even, she either needs to get glasses or go to beauty school for the first time.  i was forced to come back and get someone else to work on his hair and try to fix the damage.    i donot recommend this place.    first and last time."
"not your average supercuts! like most guys, i wouldn't go here if it was the last place to go, but i needed a haircut in a rush so i had no choice. ashley cut my hair the first time i came here, since then she's been the only one to cut my hair. very professional, and very good haircut, wouldn't go anywhere else."
i came in for a haircut since the last one was uneven and i was greeted by cassandra.  she was a very nice and listened to my concerns.  i felt and looked great. i love her attention to detail.  definitely coming back.
"won't be back. checked in for two people at 2 pm for 6:30 appointments. did both check ins at the same time. got my haircut and they tried to skip the other person and even argued with us about it. if it wasn't for the nice gentleman letting the other person go ahead of him, like the system should have done anyway, we would have walked out. don't bother wasting your time here. so slow as well."
"beware of the stylist marquita!! extremely rude, arrogant and also messed up my hair. i am not the one to write bad reviews . . i usually let it go as ppl can have good and bad days. but this time i was royally pissed off . . i have been going to this place since past 3 years and most of them have been pretty good. but this lady was something. . she went on sooo fast like she was trying to break a record for fastest haircut. she screwed up my sideburns. you don't mess with people's hair!! my usual stylist was felicia but was told she no longer works there so i thought might as well go along with someone else... what a mistake!!"
"when i go to a supercuts location, i heavily rely on yelp reviews to pick the right hair dresser/stylist for me.  so when we moved nearby, i relied on none other than yelp reviews to figure out who i wanted to cut my hair.i got my hair cut with lindsey and she gave me the most perfect adorable haircut when i was going from long to short hair which was a drastic change.  she is awesome at her job and knows her stuff. she also consistently asks you for your feedback on if her hair cutting is looking the way you want.  my hair is super curly and because i alternate between curly and straight hair, the cut has to be at a certain length for both styles to work.  lindsey always gets it right! she is the only one i go to at this supercuts and i have always left happy."
"supercuts is my go-to place for my hairstyling needs and i was excited when a location opened in secaucus. lindsay was the first to cut my hair over a year ago and i'm happy to see that she is still there.jillian was my stylist for my recent coloring needs and she did an excellent job with my highlights and understood my love of red. she helped make the time pass with great conversation and made me feel like a vip.the ladies are friendly and take the time to listen to your hair wants. i have no problem letting them make recommendations and getting a little creative.give them a try, you won't regret it!"
"lisa has been cutting my hair for a couple years, and she is the best one they have.  there is always a line for her to cut someone's hair, thank you lisa."
"i've been going there for a while always had excellent service. the place used to be open 9-9, but a sign on the door now says due to staffing shortages they're open 11-7. michael cut my hair he had no idea what he was doing! after i left i got an email from them asking me about my experience. i totally blasted them & gave very specific examples of why i was unhappy. never heard back from them. they just lost a loyal customer."
they don't know what they are doing. they cut hair unevenly and now i have to go fix it some place. never again!they offered to not take a fee for the haircut .. which does not fix anything.
warning! this review comes from someone who has visited this salon quite a few times and has constantly had only bad experience. unprofessional and inexperienced people cut and style hair here. they somehow make your hair look way worse than it was before! long waiting time and extremely poor management adds to the fury! beware of one mr.michael who ruins the complete look of your hair. he has a bad sense of hair styling and gives a very uneven hair cut.think twice before you lend your hair to him! both me and my husband have been returning customers as it is the closest to our home. but we have realized that it is time to look out for a better salon that makes the whole experience and money spent worthwhile.
"i was looking for a place to get a haircut and i had never been to a supercuts before, so i decided to try things out. it was during the afternoon so there were several other people already waiting. they have spots to sit up at the front and back of the store to wait.  i ended up waiting about 20-25 minutes to be called. once i was called, the haircut was done relatively quickly and it went very smoothly. typically i get buzz cuts or beard trims so the kinds of haircuts i get are relatively easier to manage then most. my hairstylist was wonderful and was very accommodating. if i'm in the area again, i might visit. the facility isn't as clean or flashy as other places but it gets the job done."
"disclaimer: i didn't get a haircut.checking in online is literally the same as walking in off the street. you should ask them what the difference is if you want to be amused.i ""checked in"" at the time i had chosen online and still had to wait. and wait. and wait. and then i had to leave because this is new york city and ain't nobody got time for that. i'd rather pay more at a salon that is organized to get a better cut because my time is money. and all i wanted to do was donate 9"" to pantene beautiful lengths! byeee"
"wait time is wildly inaccurate. sat waiting for a half hour past my check in time when there ""zero wait time"" listed. had i stayed it likely would have been another half hour!!! whats the point of having the checkin?? beyond that, employees were extremely rude and dismissive. dont bother giving your business to this place."
"horrible experience! horrible!the black woman working there is a racist.  she had such a attitude to me since i came in. i am not expecting a good survey, but at least you can give some smile. she treated me like some homeless people begging for her to get a haircut. and i gave her my phonr number, she had that disgusting look on her face and said where is that at. itold her philadelphia, then she shaked her head. i was like wtf is that supposed to mean. afterwards, i sit on the chair and she asked what do i want for hairstyle. she still talked in an attitude which made me so confused and uncomfortable. i have never been there before but i swear i will never go there any time. she kept shaking head and her facial expression was so disgusting when i show the picture of the hairstyle i want. then she kept asking me what do i want her to do. i had a scar that i want to cover, but for some reason she said she cannot do that. so i walked out. i am so sick of her attitude. there are plenty of barbers around here.i will never recommend anyone to go there. also, i regret even step into the barbershop because of the horrible experience.honestly. i do not want to give 1 star. it should be negative."
"as others have mentioned, there is no point to checking in ahead.  for the 4th time in a row, i've show up for check-in at least 10 minutes ahead of the check-in time and at that exact time, they take someone who has been waiting, but did not check in.  10 minutes after, they called me. haircut is always fine, but not worth the frustration."
"i needed a refresh to my good haircut and couldn't wait for my usual stylist appointment, so i stopped by supercuts at university place.  waited 3 minutes and was seen by shana.  i explained that i wanted a trim and shape up, she was ready to start cutting. i told her i'd like a wash first.  the shampooing was fine.  we made a little small talk, she said she's been cutting hair for 10 years.  great, i thought.she began cutting and seemed alright. i told her i'd like a bit of fringe in the front, just some wispy bits, nothing heavy.  she sectioned off the front, and showed me, i had her reduce the section, reminding her i just want some fringe, not bangs.  i showed her the length, to the middle of my nose, nothing short, just some bits.  she began to cut.the next thing i knew, she stepped to the side, pulled out the hair dryer, fluffed with her hands, no brush, for 3-5 seconds and said we were done!  the first thing i saw in the mirror was me with short bangs above my brows!  omg and wtf i told her this is not what i wanted, or asked for!she said, ""i cut to the middle of your nose like you said.i told her to blowout the rest.""""oh you want a blowout?  i thought you just wanted a cut. that's more money!""she excused herself and scurried away to rinse another customer, leaving me in the chair.  the rest of the cut is fair, not good.  the new bangs she gave me do not even blend with the sides.  moreover, the cut looks like something from the 1970's.  i decided to get up and settle the bill and go.how does a hairstylist make a living not listening to the client/customer/guest?!?stay away from shana at supercuts in the village"
"maxine was the best. she not only gave me a great quality haircut, but she was incredibly entertaining. for $23 i felt like i got a haircut and a show. i will definitely be returning to this salon in the future. can't express how friendly the service was"
worst haircut. simple men's trim and tyrone sent me out with wet matted down hair.   only after returning to work and my hair drying  did i learn that he had done such a poor job that my co workers had to share with me the bad news.   he clipped the sides with a #2 bit forgot on the left side to blend it in to the top.   this left an embarrassing and ugly haircut.  i hope that this was merely a case of tyrone being incompetent or not caring about his work.    he would not speak to me but instead gossiped continuously with his co-worker.
"i came in as a walk in and was told it would be a 15 minute wait but i can back before then and the barber, tyrone was waiting for me.he gave me a wonderful haircut and was really pleasant to talk to. haircut came put exactly to the picture of what i wanted.  highly recommend.in a city filled with barbers it's hard to find a good one, respect!!!"
"everyone here is great. they are all dedicated workers and will try their very best to meet with customers expectation. you describe what you want, and they will help you along the way. my favorite, juana, is a very kind and very happy person. she's very good with children so for those parents who want someone who's going to do well with your child's haircut, i definitely recommend her! irene is also a very lovely worker here in this establishment!"
"went in for a blowdry and the guy there did a good job on my hair. it was a pretty high price, though ($37).the reason i'm giving 3 stars instead of 4 is because when i tipped $3 (which is the usual amount where i'm from) the guy who styles me said ""no offense but in the 10-20 years i've been doing hair i've never been tipped $3"". i guess the usual tip amount in the us is higher (he said its usually 5-10)? it made me feel really bad, but i had already paid and didn't have cash on me. slighty rude of the guy, though, but it was a good quality style."
"tyrone @ supercuts, university place is the very best cutter, stylist i ever had!!i found him in westchester ny and now traveldown to greenwich village for a haircutas he is the mgr in university place store!"
black people should never stop here even if you are desperate. not a good experience. the woman that just cut my hair was awful. she didn't take time. didn't try to blend and left bald spots. she also kept poking me in the head with clippers. i knew better but decided to just end my day with a terrible haircut.
"i called ahead for my appointment - i waited about 10 minutes on arrival and was placed with a stylist. she listened to my request (a simple, unlayered, blunt bob) and followed through perfectly. i paid $27 and couldn't be more pleased... especially as this trip was to correct the work of an overzealous and inattentive stylist at a trendy salon in bushwick. i'll be coming to this supercuts from now on - nothing is more valuable than someone who is willing to cut you hair the way you ask!"
i originally had an appointment with another salon but the man working there wouldn't cut my hair because he thought i was a woman. after that experience i decided to try my luck at supercuts and was not disappointed. i was seated after about five minutes of walking in and got exactly what i wanted! the stylist i had was very nice and had my hair all done in no time. i would highly recommend coming here and with their prices it really can't be beat!
"i had a long wait time, but this wasn't their fault. it was very busy and i didn't have an appointment.tatyana did a fantastic job on my cut! i love it. as others have mentioned, the place isn't super clean but i don't think it's unreasonable for what you pay for either. the stylists tools are cleaned after ever guest and that's all that matters to me!i will return. for people who are no fuss with their hair, you can't beat the ease and price!"
"i usually go to another location which does my hair perfectly every time but i  had an appointment a few blocks away so i had to settle for this one. went in on a monday at 1pm and was the only customer. the two stylists there were annoyed and weren't doing anything. explained what i wanted and showed the stylist a picture and she swatted the picture away saying ""yeah i know"" without looking at it and rolling her eyes and sucking her teeth. all i wanted was a wash, trim, and blow out of my long layered bob and bangs. she cut it too short so now its all one length and blew it out and curled the ends under. i left upset and looking like a mushroom. phone kept ringing and she and the other stylist kept complaining about this phone meeting they were going to have at 4pm and refused to answer the phone the entire time i was there probably to avoid customers. the place is also dark, drab and dirty. was asked to set my purse down on the floor by my feet while sitting in the chair when i spotted what looked like thick dried coffee or chocolate splattered on the walls under the table and floors that no one bothered to clean. i then picked up my purse and held it on my lap the whole time. they also don't dust, sweep or mop the floors. filthiest salon i've ever been to."
"i was so happy with my haircut here recently.  i went at lunch time and there was no wait.  i was taken right away, and i usually get simple-type cuts.  but even then, many places don't do it right.  how hard is it to layer?  well, the girl i got knew how to layer and framed my face so nicely.  she did a great job.  i have had the best haircuts in my life at supercuts and great clips and the worst at high-priced salons.  i never have coloring done, so i can't speak to that.  i also don't have contemporary/trendy/experimental cuts, so i can't speak to that.  i know it depends on the stylist you get, because i've had some blah experiences at these places too, but this was a great cut."
"had the sweetest lady trim my hair today. she gave me a clean, even cut in no time. thanks supercuts!"
"i go to this place because my cut is simple: #1 on my entire head. if you go after 7pm on weekdays you get half off.  i have been here twice and have had something negative both times.#1 i got my standard buzz cut and was looking great. the barber was finishing up the back of my neck when she decided to _really_ dig in. my nexk was nearly scraped raw. it burned when i touched so when i got home i had my wife look at it and there were visible parallel scratch marks that broke the skin, traveling from the base of my neck to my hairline. i was sore for a few days.#2 i arrived at 7pm and there were 4 busy barbers, 3 waiting customers. i was set to see a movie at 8 and my cut takes about 5 minutes, so i figured i had plenty of time. i was wrong. if the barbers were a bit more efficient i would have made it, but each one took a 10 minute break between customers. at 7:45 i was next and a barber had finished her customer. then decided to take a break and didn't return. she was still in the building, just not cutting any hair. i had to wait until 8:05pm for the next barber to finish her customer, and finish her break before getting my cut.i know i could call ahead to minimize the wait, but i don't really mind it. i do mind the laziness of these barbers though. i bet that they get paid by the hour instead of by the client, so there is little incentive to speed things along. even with the half-off pricing post-7pm, i am still going to look elsewhere for a place to take my simple cut."
"if you just need a basic haircut, i've been to supercuts a few times and it's been a great option. most recently, i went right when it opened and was taken right away. i have straight hair and asked for two inches trimmed off and got exactly that (i've been to fancier places where somehow 2 inches turned to them cutting off 5). the hair dresser did a great job, it took 15 minutes, and, even with a 20% tip, the total cost was less than $30. i feel embarrassed thinking i used to get the exact same cut for over $70! i'm confused when i see people putting 1 star review for supercuts when they need their hair dyed/wanted something fancy because i would never go here for something like that, but for a basic cut, it's been perfect!"
"this place is awful. i was last here years ago and got a really bad haircut but supercuts is so close to my apartment and so convenient. this time around, i just needed a few inches cut off my hair but while i was waiting i saw the manager be super rude to ppl. one customer was explaining what she wanted and the manager was so rude. the manager made a snide remark about results and the customer being picky. then an elderly guy asked the manager a question about the charge to his credit card while he was being rung up and she was so rude, i cringed. and then i left. get your haircut somewhere else. customer service is last in this place."
"the worst horrible haircut in my  life, the cut was great but the idiot sprayed my hair with a thinning solution that all but destroyed my hair, if it gets any thinner i will be bald and then i  will sue super cuts."
great haircut gladys did an awesome job and she also have me tips that were very helpful. as the saying goes you get what you pay for so keep that in mind. i've been getting my hair cut at supercuts for as long as i can remember and i've never had an issue. but i'm just one little ole person what do i know.
went in for a fade and trim on top and walked out with choppy hair. it was near closing on a friday and i had to ask the stylist twice to blend the sides in better. she was pleasant but should not be cutting hair. i had to go to another barber the next day to get it fixed.
"surprised at all the negative reviews below.  this is a cheap no-frills place... and it was totally fine as such!  walked in and asked for a roots touch-up.  yvonne was available, she immediately quoted me the cost ($40) and took me in.  she was nice but not super-chatty which was just as well.  the whole thing (coloring, washing, brushing and styling) took about an hour, and she was gentle combing my super-curly easily tangled hair.  she did a nice job with the color, too.i have a feeling people with negative reviews are expecting something along the lines of fancier salons... while this one is market with one dollar sign for a reason.  my expectations were perfectly met.i'll gladly be back."
"whatever you do, do not let maria cut your hair. she gave me attitude the entire time, even though my cut was nothing fancy - i only came in to trim the ends and touch up the layers. she acted like i was asking for the most elaborate and complicated style she had ever seen and argued with me when i explained that i did not have an angle, i simply was growing out bangs so it appeared to be an angle. the worst part, however, was when she flat out told me, ""well i don't like it, but if you do, then whatever."" maybe stylists here should be advised to keep unsolicited advice to themselves, especially when it's rude. if you're going to offer criticism, at least a. wait until i ask for your opinion or b. offer a suggestion for what you think, as a stylist, would look better, instead of just telling me that you don't like my cut... especially considering you just cut it. also considering i only got a trim, she was essentially insulting my hair in general. other than that, be prepared for a long wait, filled with watching the stylists chat about what they're doing that night, while no one's hair is being cut. and beware if you have a cartilage piercing! mine was not so gently ripped out with a comb. take it out beforehand (shouldn't hair stylists know how to handle those?) unless you want an additional hole in your ear."
"i thought i was getting a good deal for getting to the tips of my hair dyed deep red. the stylist seemed to be working on more of my hair than i had asked for, so i confirmed what i wanted and showed her a picture, and she said she knew what she was doing. i left with 3/4 of my hair dyed a terrible orange red, and she charged me $20 that what i had originally wanted for some ""extra process."" i went home and dyed it back to my natural brown. tl;dr you could dye your hair better in your own sink."
went in for a straight trim across the bottom - no layers or angles. came out with two completely different haircuts on each side of my head. not sure i can rock this look.
does this look even to you?? clearly the hack that provided this cut thought it was perfectly even. by far the worst haircut i've ever received.
"one of the worst things about moving somewhere new is finding a decent hairdresser that won't charge you a small fortune. so i thought i would give supercuts a go because i'm generally not fussy with my hair, it's just around the corner and i'm on a budget. i should have known better. i don't even know what the stylists name was - she was blonde, surly and didn't even say hello or ask how i was. that's bare bones politeness in my opinion. i prefer not making small talk when getting a haircut, but general pleasantness should be expected. anyway - i would forgive all that if it weren't for the monstrosity of a haircut this woman bestowed upon me. it's completely uneven, hacked into on one side so much that it looks like a four year old took to one side of my head with some kitchen scissors. the ends have been chopped so bluntly, it's hideous. for the style i asked for, she should have done that zig-zag type technique on the ends. absolutely no texturing to thin out my thick hair and give it some shape through the bulkier bits....nothing. and the way my hair sits, it literally just looks like she forgot to cut the back bit. i look like i'm growing out an awful bob-mullet hybrid. the only saving grace is that i can still fit my hair back into a pony tail to hide how awful it looks when it's out. i shouldn't have walked out like that, but i didn't realise how bad it was until i got home and examined it closely. it's truly the worst haircut i've ever had. and for someone who really isn't fussy about their hair...that's saying something. i even cried because it was so damn ugly. i've tried a multitude of ways to style it, but it doesn't matter what i do...it just looks terrible. i'm going to have to get it fixed by someone else now, so instead of just originally paying someone a decent amount to cut my hair properly, i have now wasted almost $30 to have some stink eye hack ruin my hair. i'm also going to have to cut it much shorter than i originally wanted to fix what she's done. thanks a lot supercuts. never ever ever again. i would probably only recommend this place to someone i hate."
"i'm one of those girls that does not care about my hair. it's long, very fine, i don't have a lot of it, and pricy haircuts in the past have not made a huge difference in terms of the look/feel. as long as i get an even haircut with subtle layers, i'm happy. with that said, i really like this place. there are no extra frills unless you want (and pay) for them. every stylist that has cut my hair here has been pretty good, and none have had an attitude (i've been coming here for two years). keep in mind that they are not going to be as experienced/skilled as stylists in more expensive salons, nor should they be since you're only paying $21 for your haircut. this is the place to stop in for a trim or simple cut on your way home, not the place to go from waist length hair to a-line bob right before an event. if you keep it simple and don't have unrealistic expectations, you will walk out with a great haircut (and damp hair unless you want to pay extra for a blowout)."
"so many places in the city overcharge people for a simple haircut. not this place.  i got a wash, cut, and dry for a flat fee of 47 dollars.  there was no one there so i was immediately taken and the woman was so nice and she cut my hair to my liking.  a bit hesiate to go in the beginning because of the reviews but glad i went anyway"
she ruined my hair!!!! i said i wanted to keep length and she cut all of it off! livid!
"there are so many bad reviews that i feel like it's important to share my experience. i went for a wash and cut. gladys cut my hair, and was very professional and friendly. she also did not rush through the cut and did a nice job. i have no complaints."
"incompetent. went in for a trim and the person wouldn't do it. all they did was cut the bottom, not the layers. she never event touched the top. i asked her to and she said she can't do it. i ask he why can she simply said she can't do it, then stopped and and literally walked away. she said she wouldn't charge me, and she didn't, not even when i tried to tip her for her time (which i'm glad for now) but she left me with a butchered head. all i wanted was a trim. i said, ""trim everything an inch."" how is that so difficult?"""
"popped in on friday around 4pm. was seen immediately. great hair wash (good massaging) and the cut was good. very simple trim - about 1/2"" off the ends. will return for sure!"
"i really like this place ! i always do there highlight ,  haircut once even when i did highlight come over with my baby and they were ok with it i recommend this place.i would like to add that i very much like the price so i go there :)"
"horrible customer service, over priced, and no idea how to run a business. don't use the app to check in because it means nothing and you will still wait 2 hours!!!!"
"marisol is absolutely the best. i've been going to her for the past year and just absolutely love her. she gives a beautiful haircut , understands what you want, and makes you feel completely comfortable. i highly recommend her. she's as amazing as a hairdresser as she is a beautiful person inside."
ask angelica if you're getting a blow dry. definitely coming here instead of going to a blow dry bar. worth the money!
"gets the job done, i will definitely go back next time i need a haircut but this location is not as good as other supercuts i've been to.  rachel cut and washed my hair. i have a very basic style (straight across​) so i never like to spend more than $30 on a haircut.  she was a little rough on the shampooing, and during the cut she kept talking to other stylists which made me a little worried that she wasn't paying attention.  overall, i walked in on a saturday and didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes.  i don't know if i would recommend this place for intricate cuts or coloring.  but if you have a basic style, i'd recommend giving it a shot!"
been to many hair salons and can honestly say i was taken for my money. shareif is a life saver and life changer! he fixed the many many years of horrific hair damage i had done to myself. he also educated me to prevent future damage. his professionalism is over the top. no matter how busy he is he always carries a smile. any place would be extremely lucky to have him with such talent!
"i slip into supercuts every now and then if i need a trim or haircut/blowout and don't feel like paying my expensive regular salon prices. i went recently to jess and she did a great job. from the shampoo, to cut to blowout (which made my hair so soft and lasted for 3 days) i walked out very happy. on that particular day there was no wait which was a bonus as well. for the price and quality of the cut i received, i will return again."
it's second time i'm coming within opening hours and they tell me they're closed. if they only accept by appointment they should mention it. don't trust them...
"don't know the name of the woman that cut my husband hair yesterday, but from the way she cut my husband hair you would think it's her first time holding a  scissor/clippers. to top it off all the women working there look angry. we will never go there again. i recommend they hire more experienced hair dressers."
"i've gone here five times now because it's around the corner from where i live and cheap hoping it will finally be passable, and each time it was a disaster... uneven, like these people are holding scissors for the first time - i'm a guy with straight short hair, it's almost impossible to get wrong. also the staff are a tad unfriendly and snarky - one gets the sense they don't care one way or another."
"i must say this is the worst haircut experience i've ever had. the barber clearly had no idea what she was doing. the attitude was okay but the technique was awful. usually when i got a haircut and if there's something not perfect, i'll go back home trim a little to fix it. but this time it was so terrible that i can't even makes it right. i don't often leave a review on here especially if it's negative, but today i felt that i have the responsibility to tell the truth and remind others don't repeat my mistakes and end up like me."
"awful cut! i should have know better. unfortunately rachel doesn't know how to cut hair. each side was different lengths, lopsided etc. it was a mess. i had to go to someone else to make it look descent."
"worst service ever! they just made me wait 20 minutes only to tell me ""oh i'm sorry i don't feel comfortable washing and drying your hair""... because of my brain surgery scar! total waste of time and i felt very humiliated in front of all the other people waiting -they really need to learn how to deal with customers in a more polite manner ..that was horrible being ridiculed in front of other people"
"i was going to hoboken hair every other month because it was pretty cheap and close. i started to dislike the haircut i was receiving, even though it was kind of cheap. i decided i would give super cuts a try and boy am i glad i did. first of all sadé is my favorite. she gives a great cut and always has great recommendations for myself. great service and great prices."
"i called ahead to ask if i could come in for highlights and a cut. i was told i could make the appointment and was told the price for the service. while i was on my way to the appointment, they called me and asked if i could get there earlier because apparently they needed more time to do my hair, which was why i called to ask in the first place. when i told them i was almost there (which was even before my original appointment), they told me i couldn't come and that the price they originally gave me was not correct. this experience tells me that they are extremely disorganized. i would have liked to have been told that i couldn't come in the first place so that i was not rushing to the appointment. when i had previously been there for a cut, i had to wait, even when i had made an appointment and the stylists acted annoyed that i was even there. i will not be going back."
was exactly what i was looking for! 21$ including tip hair cut (no wash) and blow dry! shaday (spelling may be totally off) was sweet fast and professional!
"i had two great experiences at this salon. sade, was my stylist and she rocks. she gave me my best cut in the past five years.the online check-in service was helpful too."
"i have been going to this location for about 7 years and i had a very bad experience this morning. i had to mention this so others wont have this issue ever again. hopefully management will notice. it's been a couple weeks since i returned to get my normal haircut, with cindy and when i arrived at 8:05 this morning to get my haircut, i was told ""she doesn't work here anymore"" with an attitude. i thought nothing of it until they actually shut the door on me, when the hours state 8:00 am until 8:00 pm. i stood outside for a couple of minutes to wait and noticed they were drinking coffee in the back while i waited outside and it was 8:05 am. are you serious? that is so rude. why ? very bad hospitality. i would stay away from this location and go to the one on route 3. never again will i return."
"if i could give this place 0 stars and still leave a review i would. avoid at all costsi usually get my hair cut at super cuts, i just moved to the area and went here a few days before an interview to get my cut cleaned up and i walked out fuming.the girl cutting my hair left it choppy (in a bad way) and very visibly uneven. she cut my hair wet, dried it, showed it to me and i told her it wasn't what i wanted could she please fix it--she says ok and starts dry cutting my hair!! i have straight hair, it should not be dry cut, ever!i walked out very upset. i went to another local place -- avanti beauty -- and when the woman there saw my hair she said ""oh my god what did she do to you!""avoid. at. all. costs."
"$18 for a haircut is pretty steep.   the cut was fine, no complaints, but i can get the same cheaper elsewhere.i can say though that i had a short wait for a walk-in.  that's always a plus."
a very nice stylist named nailah cut my hair. she did a great job and was very pleasant. will definitely be going back again
"absolutely awful!!  if i could give it no stars i would. i set up an online appointment and when i walked in there were two women working and i was treated as though i was bothering them. and although there was no line, a man who had walked in a couple minutes before me with no appointment was taken before me and then i had to wait for the woman to sweep the floors and finish her conversation with her co-worker before she would take me. she also informed me that my appointment should have been cancelled since they only accept appointments made one hour in advance. there was no mention of this on the website and at the time, there was only myself and one guy in there. and again i felt unwelcome like i was bothering them! then, i asked for a simple trim straight across, nothing difficult. she cut my hair quickly and instead of thoroughly inspecting how straight my hair was cut (which is difficult since i have long dark hair that blends into the black cloak you have on), i assumed she cut it correctly and even gave her an $8 tip on an $18 trim. unfortunately, i came home washed and dried my hair and saw that it was completely chopped! a five year old could have done a better job!  i now need to go get it cut again in order to fix the mess she made of my hair!!  if i could reverse the charge, i would. i should not have to pay to be treated rudely and have my hair hacked!i will never go here again. i assumed anyone working at a hair place would understand what a straight line is and how to trim hair!! obviously not here....absolutely awful!!!!"
"dear long hairs: it is not worth it if you want to save money and/or time. trust me, you do not want to risk it.it is better if you wait one/two more days or simply spend the double or triple at a professional hair salon. sincerely,exlonghair girl."
"i still prefer going to my usual barbershop, but my schedule lately meant that last saturday was the only good day to get a haircut...and my boys are closed on saturday.so, with a 5k coming up this weekend, i need that aerodynamic boost that only my usual buzz cut can provide. do you even laws of physics, bro?anyway, supercuts was sufficient for a quick buzz. i guess they are used to more intricate work, and the ladies working there got a laugh when i said  ""just gimme a 2 on top, 1 on the sides, square in the back"" - i was probably one of the fastest cuts and easiest customers they've had to work on.it was a little pricier than my usual place (18 vs 15), but yeah, it was fine for me. ready to race!"
pros: i got in fast but it was also the middle of the day. the hair stylist i had did a good job on my hair. cons: the hairstylist i had wasn't too friendly. i also had a hard time understanding her because of her thick russian accent. when she was cutting my hair she kept pulling on it. it hurt so bad that my eyes watered.  for the love of god don't come here. save your money(also your beautiful locks) and don't come here. i do not recommend this place at all.
this is probably the worse place to get your hair cut. when i walked into this store the smell was so bad. they didn't do a good job on the haircut i had. one side hair was longer than the other. i've had better haircuts paying the same prices at other salons. i do not recommend.
"after my long-time hair dresser sadly quit and abandon me of eleven (11) years i had to find another hair salon, but with a budget i am unable to seek a high-end salon.  without an appointment, i waited five short minutes to be seated.  the hair dresser washed my hair with shampoo and conditioner and then cut it to my desired length as requested.  after the cut was completed she did not blow dried my hair leaving it wet as i roam in the streets of new york for the rest of the day.iman, my assigned hair dresser is not computer savvy as she does not know how to work a cash register to duplicate the hair cut transaction two times overcharging me.  i voiced her overcharge transaction loudly making her nearby colleague aware of her gross error which was evidently rectified.  the wash and cut came out to be $21.00 (with sales tax), but with this unpleasant register transaction plus no blow dry i gave iman a $4.00 tip."
this place is horrible went for a haircut showed the lady a picture of the haircut i wanted she asked if i wanted my hair trimmed she showed me a length to trim and told her yes and what happens she cuts it way past that and ends up cutting half the hair off of my head
"why can't fh have a decent place to get a haircut. after having a terrible experience at a barbershop in the same area i can here, and boy was that a mistake. immediately after being seated and my cut began, an angry customer came i. and took photos of the licenses of my stylist because he was outraged at the cut and customer service he received.it was too late for me to get up and leave so i had to sit through. she completely disregarded my instructions, kept asking ""how's this?"", didn't seem to understand how to blend as i had to remind her.  complexity missed my neckline, looked like some kind of weird rat tail / mullet situation.steer clear."
"today was my 2nd visit at super cuts of forest hills ny. susan did again a wonderful work on my pixie cut and color. i returned because as a busy mother, with tight schedule between soccer and over activities, i found that the cut and color susan mastered about three months ago, grew into a beautiful long pixie while the highlights she applied last time still last till this day, when she only needed to do my roots. as it grew i kept getting compliments on my long pixie and highlights and asked if i visited the salon recently. that's a bonus, yes cost and time effective, but most importantly, i didn't feel that pressure of, ""i am in a dire need to do my hair and soon!"" i appreciate that the salon and staff seem to have their regulars' loyalty, from children to teenagers, to middle aged and so on. the atmosphere there is a nice combo between an 80's and 90's, plus some contemporary, playing in the background while the hair masters chat nicely and ask their next costumer what they would like to change or keep about their hair ....i like being there reading my book while my color is settling in, or chat with susan while she flawlessly is back and forth between me and another costumer. thank you susan and team, i will be back! gigi"
susanne cut and colored my hair and she's fabulous. i got nothing but compliments from everyone!
"i wish i could give this place negative 5 stars.  i usually go to michicche salon down the block, but i had to get my kids' hair cut last minute for school pictures and decided to just take them to supercuts this one time since they didn't require an appointment. i figured, how bad can it be? they only need a trim. when we walked in, the place was empty.  that should have given me a clue that i should walk us right back out. there were 2 ""hairdressers"" that were just sitting in the chairs and talking. so one of them takes my son first. i explained to her that she only needed to give him a trim, nothing special. she gets the buzzer out and as soon as she starts to buzz the back of his hair i already know it's not going to go well. she looked like she'd never given a haircut in her life. what he ended up with was something that looked like someone placed a bowl on top of his head and cut around it. my son is very particular about his hair and when he saw what she did to it he looked miserable. i put on my happy face and told him it looked good, but i was fuming. i wanna drop kick the woman at this point. not only did he have the dreaded bowl cut, but it was choppy and uneven. i could have created the monstrosity myself at home, probably would have done better. my daughter is taken next and i'm praying to god that hers turns out different. not! this woman was way worse than the one that cut my son. my daughter's hair was down to the middle of her back and she wanted to have it cut to her shoulders. i asked the woman if she could give her some layers because she has so much hair that it looks really bulky in the back. she proceeds to look at me like i have ten heads, or am speaking a different language. her confusion worries me so i think better of it and tell her to forget the layers. she gets ready to start cutting and looks all sorts of awkward and inexperienced holding the scissors. she didn't even wet her hair. i'm no expert, but i've never had a ""dry"" haircut. i realize there is no hope for this haircut to turn out any different than my son's.  they must have an adverse reaction to evenly cut hair because, like my son, my daughter ended up with her hair being longer on one side. i was fully aware that my kids wouldn't be getting a state of the art haircut at this place because, well, you get what you pay for and all that, but i figured these people would atleast have some basic cutting skills and be able to pull off a damn trim. needless to say, if i ever find myself in a jam again, i will be cutting my kids' hair myself. there is not a chance in hell i could do a worse job than these so called hairdressers. epic fail supercuts. epic fail!"
"i was there for a haircut today. dalia took me right away and asked what i desired. i gave her the exact description of what i wanted. she started the cut, and asked questions along the way to make sure that i got what i wanted. she also offered some advice as far as how i could change my cut. it showed that she cared. my only concern was that she didnt do the hot towel at the end which helps clean up the loose hair. overall: good haircut, decent price, dalia is better than the other stylist that i had previously seen there."
"shea moved to another salon and the woman who cut my hair this time wasn't as good by a long shot. i didn't wash my hair before going, usually they wash it for me. the woman asks me if i want a wash as well and i tell her yes, i just don't want any shampoo or conditioner used- just water. she doesn't want to do this. instead she tells me to just sit in the chair and she'll spray my hair with some water. my hair isn't clean and this doesn't really work. i ask for layers and a trim. it's simple, but she doesn't spend a lot of time on me before she says she's done. i had asked for ""as many layers as she could fit into my head"" and i barely see any. i show her where to shorten it up and add more, and she does, but she also tells me my hair is too greasy to see the layers. um...no. my hair is greasy, because you refused to wash it for me, but i can still see the haircut. so she finishes and i tell her next time we'll wash it- and i stress with water only- because i'm allergic to many products. she replies, ""that's ok, we have products for sensitive people"". jesus, no, that's not what i said. shea never had a problem just water washing my hair and i don't understand the insistence here, or the implied refusal to wash my hair without products. it's cool, i'm not going to argue with you about it, i'm just going to go somewhere else.after i got home, washed and blowed out my hair i notice a distinct lack of layers. there's one layer in the front, and a longer one in the back. two layers isn't really what i was after and i don't know what else i could have said to get...well, layers. anyway, i hope shea is happy where she is, maybe i'll find her in my search for a new salon."
"you pay for what you get.  i was in a complete pinch for a trim so i stopped in. i should have known from the wash - if you can call it that. i was at the sink for maybe 90 seconds. she barely washed my hair, and i swear there was no conditioner.  i had to brush my own hair because she needed to check her facebook.  she asked how much to take off, i showed her. instead of the half inch i showed her, she took off two full inches.  two. full. inches. then she stuck me under the drier so she could cut someone else's hair. for 20 minutes. when i finally got back to the chair, she attempted the worst blowout i've ever had.  i walked out with curly, frizzy pieces of hair in the back, and the front looked plastered to my forehead. when i expressed my disappointment, she dismissed me. i went home to wash and redry my hair. never. again."
"i noticed after i posted this that she cut my hair unevenly. my right side is a good 1/2-1"" longer than my left side. really lame, supercuts."
"they completely botched my eyebrows, half of it is missing! i specifically said not to make them thinner! do not come here!"
"had a great experience! i walked in at seven pm and got a perfect cut and color in under an hour. this place provides great service and extremely reasonable prices unlike other salons in forest hills. the stylist was very friendly and listened to what i wanted, she picked out a great highlighting color for my jet black hair. the blowout was also fast and painless being i have ethnic curly hair which many salons don't know out to properly cut. this place is a must for great affordable service!"
"the barber was friendly, fast and skilled. the location had no lines and the hair cut was exactly what i wanted. only concern is that the price is a little high."
"sue cuts my hair, i don't have to worry about a thing and always get compliments, even from strangers. and the hair snobs cannot believe i go to supercuts. i guess when you find the right haircutter it doesn't matter where they work :)"
"do they have the most skilled stylists? probably not. so if you're a woman who absolutely must have have the perfect haircut, then this place isn't for you. but if you're a guy who just needs a clean cut look every month or so, then this place is perfect. waits are usually not long and prices are reasonable."
"do not go here. i took my 7year old niece for a simple/no frills haircut and it was so uneven that i took her to spectrum to have it fixed right after. i shouldn't have paid or given a tip, but i am not evil. there was an older woman also getting her hair done at the same time and she kept saying her hair was uneven as well. i should have known better. $15 isn't worth it.  walk two stores down and get a quality haircut!"
"i went here to get a quick haircut because my normal stylist was on vacation and i needed to go somewhere nearby.i made an appointment online for a wash & cut. i came in and waited 30 minutes for a pre-made appointment. once i was put in the chair the stylist didn't offer to wash my hair, sloppily put the bib on me and started cutting. now asking me my cut, what i wanted or how short. the woman wouldnt give me her name, presumably because i was visibly annoyed. she cut my hair uneven, 3 inches shorter than i wanted and then asked why i wasn't tipping her.her name is susan. the only reason i know that is because a friend of mine walked in, asked her and walked out.don't waste even $20 there."
ana did exactly what i wanted with my hair. she recommended me the right products. awesome service. thank you ana for my lovely haircut
"i went in for a trim, and i had to let the hairdresser know that she cut my hair completely uneven. but, then again...i shouldn't complain much since it was a $20 haircut."
"i got my haircut by stephanie. i was taken right away, and she discussed with me exactly how i wanted my hair cut. she then proceeded to give me a great detailed haircut. after that, she gave me the hot towel, followed by a shampoo, and styling my hair.she was a good conversationalist, and didn't rush.i encourage all men to get their haircut by stephanie. i certainly will come back to her."
"my wife went here friday evening. she originally called for a blow dry and was quoted $35.she arrives to a rude woman who tells her it will be $48. she asked why the extra charge? to which she came up with nonsense.... since it was friday evening, it was too late to go to anyone else so she stayed. they tortured her hair and did a horrible job. they even had a audacity to ask for a tip!stay away from this crap whole, the other reviewers are correct as well these people are unprofessional, crooks, and completely incompetent!!!!!"
"hi, i gave them another try & found out why i shouldn't have! this is the second time in 2 yrs that they royally messed up the simplest haircut ever. i asked for a classic cut , no layers, angled towards the face with my hair being slightly longer in front than the back. both rose & now anna, couldn't seem to get it right & did the haircut in reverse, with it being shorter in front. she ended up needing to cut a full inch more than what i wanted to 'fix' it. a horror. i'm not sure what to say other than they both admitted to their mistake & looked embarrassed. messing up a woman's hair is a sin. honestly, i'm never going back. be careful how you describe anything to them & ask them to repeat it back before they cut."
"i have only had 1 supercuts experience and it was literally - ok. i had a an appointment for 930am to be in and out - which i was. i was the first and only person in their aside from my stylist, anna. she was bright eyed and ready to go. she was chatty but not annoying. i asked for a very simple cut. i asked for my ends to be trimmed, which they were but not enough was taken off. i dont think i will go back. cheap price but you get what you pay for. 3 stars because i was in and out, price is cheap, and anna was nice."
consistently awful. i came her reluctantly because because we needed to get a cut. i vowed never to go again but came again because my regular hair cutter went mia. several years ago my son got a bad cut by an inexperienced hair cutter who drew blood by clipping my son's ear. so bad. you can just tell the inexperience by the service and lack of confidence by the hair cutters. my son asked for a trim with a bit longer on top and got buzzed on the side and top and the two were poorly blended so that a hard line still shows. my son is so upset he's been in his room sulking all day and vowed not to go to school tomorrow because of the embarrassment. avoid at all costs.
"just wanted to give kudos to rosa at the bell blvd supercuts. i have long wavy hair and rosa took the time to listen to what i wanted and executed the haircut to perfection.  she told me she was going to give me a $100 haircut and she did (of course it really only cost less than $20.00).  she is talented, caring and a true asset to supercuts"
"today christy saved my life. or at least my look. i had gone to a borderline hipster salon in flushing earlier and asked for an edgy asymmetrical pixie cut. i showed them pictures of what i wanted and was careful to use words like ""choppy"" and ""punk"". after two hours of meticulous snipping and very little of letting me see what the heck he was doing, i ended up looking like a sound of music-obsessed soccer mom. that was not what i was going for. i lasted one afternoon before i just couldn't live with this haircut anymore and ran to the nearest hair salon: supercuts. there, i saw christy with her colored locks and covered tattoos and instantly felt hope. she had all the right questions, understood my woes completely and regaled me with entertaining stories of misunderstandings between customers and stylists. in a matter of minutes, she transformed my hair misfortune into a hair miracle. thank you to christy and supercuts on bell!"
came in to get my haircut was approached by anna literally got the worst haircut of my life it looks like a 3 year old gave me a cut dont go here better off going across the street to hair studio 41 for a real barber experience
the place needs to completely replace their staff.  consistently terrible customer service.  hire employees with character and work ethic.  just because you are not the owner or manager does not mean that you can get away with treating paying customers like crap.  fire all of them and replace them.
"the service here is consistently awful. i was worried on my first visit when a customer was arguing with the staff, i should have known to not buy a haircut package then. and even when the staff struggled to use the system that required me to pay $0.53 sales tax on the card it should have been clear to me. today was the last straw when i was quoted a wait of 20 mins, only to be left staring at them when 30 mins passed. and then when it was 45 mins in someone else who came in after me complained and was told they would be next i knew that it was over. i asked when i could expect someone and they all just stared at me. i walked out after an hour. i left my supercuts card. i won't need it ever again, anywhere. why can't i give zero stars?"
"after coming here for the past 10 years (since i was 13) i've decided to take my business elsewhere. call in for an appointment and they still tell you to wait 45 minutes. as for quality of haircut, you just have to get lucky. i can't stay loyal to this place i once loved any longer."
"inez is the worst stylist ever!!!!!!!!!  she ruined my 15 month old sons hair. it was his first haircut and she destroyed his beautiful locks. she never even consulted me how to cut his hair, she just started cutting!!!!! not only is it waaaaayyyyy too short, it's completely uneven!!!!!! thank god he's too little to undergo ridicule from his peers but i feel terrible that i allowed this to happen to him. please take the scissors away from this awful woman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"i did a walk in today at supercuts, and was taken right away. the first lady at the counter was a bit abrupt, but i brushed it off and it was taken over by my stylist. i was the only customer at the time. the girl that did my hair, arianna, was nice and tried to make small talk, but i'm always awkward at talking during my haircut. she was very knowledgeable and gave me her input on what would look better, but still leaving it up to me. i have had many stylists tell me how it should go and that was the only way. i also wanted to get my eyebrows waxed, which arianna also took me back to do. she  seemed to have trouble - tried twice to get under my eyebrow and ripped out the wrong way (she went with the growth, not against). she then went to get another girl (the girl who greeted me originally) who took care of me and did a good job.i usually get my hair done at supercuts - what can i say? i've never had a bad experience and it's good for the price. this supercuts wasn't great, but not bad. they did decent work."
"i preface this by saying i am a black guy...this matters?so a funny thing happened when i went to super cuts on an evening after work, i went in because i was looking for a basic 'take all the hair off'' buzz. there were two women and one asian guy there. as soon as i walked in, the two women walked into the back and when this poor asian guy went to get the person whose turn it was, she actually refused to cut my hair. the asian guy wound up cutting it, he did a reasonable facsimile of a haircut and then proceeded to apologetically  tell me how it was against super cuts policy to use rubbing alcohol on a freshly cut head, they recommended some perfume which would have made me break-out due to my sensitive skin. then there was a full-on summit to decide the price. good news is they didn't over-charge me but that was my first and last time in any super cuts...ever."
my son's long hair was shaved when dad asked to please only trim.  he loved his hair and feels embarrassed and ashamed.  shame on you natasha for doing this to a 6 years old.  beware who cuts your hair!!!!!!!!
had my hair cut there about 2 months ago with arianna. she was very nice and did a great cut and color on my hair.  but i called today and she is no longer with the salon.  anyone have any idea where she went to?
"i've been to other supercuts, this one is by far the worst i've ever been to. i came here one day after work with a friend because my usual hair stylist at a salon was on vacation and i needed my hair done for a night out.i can't even explain how disappointed i was. i showed the girl a picture of the haircut i wanted, explained it in full detail, and i guess she decided she didn't want to do it, so she did something completely different. my bangs were butchered so i had to keep them up in a clip until my girl came back from vacation and could fix them. all she did was complain about how dry my hair was and then insisted i get the deep conditioning, needless to say she didn't sell me on it. and last but not least - what really annoyed me - i asked for my hair to be blow dried and straightened. she dried my hair with a brush and dryer, and then literally took a few pieces of my hair, ran over it real quick with the most out-dated inefficient flat iron i've ever seen (didn't even do my whole head or in layers) and said ""ok!"", complimented herself on such a nice job, and then slapped a nice little fee onto the bill for ""straightening"" my hair. i could've done a better job myself with my iron at home. my friend wanted to get her hair done as well, she had to wait until i was done, and by the time i was, she was so turned off by the way they did my hair that she told them nevermind. some of the staff is very nice, the others have such horrible attitudes. they charge for every little thing, and they overprice for the work that they do.i will never return here again, and believe me i have not recommended this place since my visit, nor will i in the future. i'd trust my 10 year old niece to do my hair before i come here again."
a $15.99 haircut is now $18.00 - everyone who worked there left - they won't honor coupons from corporate - you make an appointment and show up and they don't have your appointment.  it's a major disappointment - it will just be a matter of time before they have to shut down because no one will want to go there any longer.
"i have a great experience every time i come with my kids people are super nice and friendly! but we love rosalva she's super sweet and always makes sure we're happy with our haircuts, totally recommend her!"
hiwhat an experience at this locationi went here with my sonwe say hello and nobody reply back wow i am looking i went to counter this guy pointed at flat screen okfirst they try to make me give info and i refused it was first last phone and email to much info i respectfully decline and one of the lady's with glasses looked at me with the greatest discuss i have ever seen my son got his hair cut to short my hare dresser was asking me every second can i cut this can i cut that and the lady with glasses swept my feet and doesn't say sorry i was not comfortable or delighted customer service is dead herei will not return sorry
"i had been visiting another supercuts location, when my go to dresser retired. so i had to start over again...well carleen is fantastic! i visited on a saturday 6/17 and the place was moving despite the rain. she's definitely a doll, listened and got it right. i have medium length hair and needed to clean up my split ends in layers with a face frame trim and she nailed it! can't be happier..thank you carleen! i will definitely be back again."
"i go to this location even though it's not the closest one to me.  rosalva has been amazing....very nice, professional and gives really good haircuts."
this place should be ashamed to call itself a business. my mother in law who is in her 80's went in for a trim and they took off 5 inches and had the balls to charge her.  what happened to listening to your customers.  stay away go some place else.  do not waste your money
"this places surpassed all of my expectations .  i called in first and explained that i needed a very bad haircut fixed . i wasn't specific enough that i needed a wash, cut , blow dry but was accomodated anyway. carleen was the fastest, most efficient hairdresser i have ever met. she took me from wash to cut/dry in under 40 minutes. most importantly , she completly fixed my bad haircut.  this was a huge undertaking, as i had uneven layers all over my head . the only way to fix everything was to cut the hair until it was one even length . voila ! it was done quickly and for 35.00. i cannot thank this salon enough for giving me my hair back ."
"i usually go there every two weeks. i tend to get a different stylist everytime. however, that is going to change. when i came in i was warmly greeted by rosalva. i was then seated, and she began to cut my hair. she understood exactly what i wanted. before i knew it i was all finished. rosalva is now the only person to cut my hair in supercuts. great quality , and care is the soul reason why i will be coming back! thank you rosalva."
very disappointed with my experience at supercuts today.  i was met by two individuals who didn't seem that knowledgable about hair - and really didn't seem to care either.  one was openly eating her lunch in front of customers and was not very professional at check-in.  they advised me on the total price of my various styling choices with calculator in hand like i couldn't afford them and were just making sure i could pony up the cash at the end of the visit.  i don't think i was ever treated like that before and it was very unprofessional to say the least.  i ended up leaving with a sub-par style.  i used to go here a lot - decided to visit again today - but it most certainly is my last visit.
amazing haircut !! short wait.   normally i go to a very expensive salon. i ran in here on whim in desperate need of a cut because i couldn't get into my salon and saw rich.  i haven't been back to my salon since !!!
"had my hair cut by rosy gomez today. i told her i wanted a two in trim and to clean up my long layers. she ended up cutting a very thick choppy layer that was as short as my chin!i usually get haircuts in nyc that are about $100+, but decided a trim in between actual hair appointment couldn't go wrong....wrong! two other women had to come over to help when she realized she messed up. beware, this is where good hair goes to die."
"terrible haircut by rosalva. she asked me if i prefer clippers or scissors. i could have done it with clippers at home if i'm paying of course i want scissors. so she started cutting my hair. i wasn't happy with the length. she was nice to shorten it, but when the number of customers waiting are increased at 5 pm on sunday with two stylist (or just haircutter) she panicked a little bit. when she was done it was totally unsymmetrical. i told her and she said you are right and did couple of more scissor cuts and still same. people were waiting i said forget about it and left. i shouldn't give her any dime but left a good tip.so i came home i did my hair clippers symmetrical! when i was young i had accidents using the clippers and was running to the barbershop to fix it. now i go to supercuts, pay for the haircut and running to home to fix it! ridiculous. i want my money back!"
"i used to come to this place ever month for about a year, not anymore. last time i was here i decided never to go back. price is very good but the way they cut my hair just wasn't doing it. i asked her to use only scissors and she agreed to it, but ad the end she ended up cutting my hair with a machine. i would rather pay more and get a better hair cut."
"i feel like this place should be way more popular! i usually have terrible experiences going to other chains, but this supercuts has great stylists at awesome prices. today they were swamped but the girl taking care of me took her time and didn't half ass her job. she went out of her way to great clients as they walked in and would excuse herself when the phone rang -- she did a hell of a job being by herself. great place -- definitely worth it and the place to get a trim."
"i've been coming here for about a year. carleen is the best ever, very attentive, friendly and professional.  i won't let anyone else touch my roots.  so happy to have found her, keep up the great work."
i love this place !!!!! best haircut.   see rich!!!.  you will not be disappointed.   expensive haircut for cheap !!!
i have been coming to supercuts in edgewater for over a year to get 2 weekly blowouts. i've seen this salon decline in every way in the last 2 months. i have decided not to come back and these are my reasons. there is only 1 person there from opening until 11 am during the week so getting my blowout in the morning became a problem. i would watch 3-5 people walk in and walk out because of the wait times or no one available. this salon is losing a lot of customers for being understaffed and not with qualified people. how rude is it that you arrive for your appointment and as you are getting ready to sit to be washed someone else walks in and your told sorry i must take walk in haircuts before an appt for a blow out?? i'm left sitting there an extra 15-20 minutes until they are done plus the time it takes to get my hair done. that's unheard of for any salon to treat their clients with such disregard. another time i called about 6 times between 9 am - 10 am to get no answer. that was strange since the salon opens at 9:00 am. when i get there almost 10:30 am rich the manager was there by himself. i said why didn't anyone answer the phone. i was trying to call to come in. he said with an attitude it's only me here and i'm too busy to answer the phone. i had to come back at 12:00 pm if i wanted my blowout done. if your unprofessional with an attitude people will simply go elsewhere near by. i was also told by the manager last week he is raising prices on many of the services. i said why would anyone come to supercuts if your now charging more than a full service salon? he said it's nothing personal whether i liked it or not. if big changes for the better do not happen this salon is and is already losing a major amount of business by having these manager and scheduling problems. i never had any issues prior to these changes and enjoyed coming to my weekly appointments with carlina and rosey. they do the best blowouts and that's why i chose to keep coming here over a year now. i had my last straw with this place and had to find another salon to do my hair every week. my review is don't even waste your time coming there. for those prices go to a full service salon by appointment.
"looking for rude, unprofessional staff, wait times of over an hour and a staff turnaround that makes even fox news look stable? look no further than the supercuts in edgewater, nj. as an added bonus, the staff (like rosalva) will skip you over their ""favorite customers"" regardless of how long you've been waiting there. don't waste your time here. plenty of better options in the area like the sportsclips down the road for a comparable price."
nice environment. i like the computer check-in process. the service was great and very friendly staff. he gave me a good haircut!
went for a blowout before a last minute night out. they suggested a quick haircut and it was much needed. ..dead ends gone and blowout looked great!!  also lasted several days! will definitely be going back
"they asked $43 for my 7 yrs old daughter hair, just for shampoo and flat iron!!!!!be aware!!! they have no idea what they are talking about.i left the store, went to ulta they did shampoo + hair cut + blow dry with much more experienced service and paid only $22."
"check in online before going to the salon for a much reduced wait time. i got a layered haircut for $20, added a $4 off coupon i got for signing up for the supercuts mailing list online (be sure to do this well in advance, the coupon takes more than an hour to be emailed).  it's very clean inside with friendly staff. the salon is actually up the set of stairs of building 108, it's on the second floor to the right. the haircut was just what i needed, really unless you're getting an insanely complicated haircut it doesn't make sense to pay the price of a normal salon. supercuts is much more reasonable in price and is very good quality!"
"i have had good experiences here in the past, but the last time i was here it felt and looked like the hairstylist was a child cutting their doll's hair. she did not listen to what i wanted and then went ahead and gave me god-awful short layers. i never asked for layers and when i saw her chopping away, i asked if that was what she was doing, creating layers. i then decide, and told she, fine, layers, but only if they are short.my stylist was stubborn and when i drew attention to her not even parting my hair the way i normally wear it, she ignored it. she only did so at the end when cutting my bangs. again, it's the luck of the draw when you come here. i should have asked to see one of the women whom i had before who was good. unfortunately the one i found to be fantastic has probably, and rightfully so, moved on to a better salon. as for now, i'm going to pay the same amount i paid here for a haircut just to get a bang trim. eve that was too difficult for her. i can't entirely fix this haircut because the layers are ridiculously short, forcing me to wait a few months.i'd also like to add that my stylist was way more interested in gossip about the salon than her task."
"i made a huge mistake going to supercuts. this person was inexperienced and very unsure of herself. she keep asking me for directions including what scissors to use. she used very dull layering shears that kept crimping my hair. the worst part,  she started layering an inch away from my scalp result in the ridiculousness pictured here. i was clear i did not want bangs, and she lobbed off a huge chunk of hair on the right side of my face. appalling."
"i wish i could give this place zero stars. i made an online suggested appointment for 745. i walked in around 735 and was barely acknowledged. one of the hairdressers who i assume was the owner had finished cutting her persons hair a little before 8, she then proceeded to take 20 minutes to ring them up to pay. afterward she chatted with them and made phone calls instead of helping me. i waited until 830 before i finally walked out. i am absolutely disgusted by their professionalism. i was not acknowledged even once while i was sitting their for over 45minutes. thy should learn how to treat customers. absolutely disgusted by them! will absolutely never go back."
i started going to the montague st. supercuts because of the very long wait time at  university place.  i am so very happy i changed location.   i love donna.  i have seen her 3 times and she has given me a fabulous cut each time.    i will definitely be going back.     thank you donna.
"had a great experience with donna. she gave me a wash and blow dry. my hair came out much more gorgeous than i expected. she is super talented and sweet. will come back again! 5 stars!i came back, emma a manager , seems to be having a very bad day. she had a harsh attitude in her tone towards me and another customer. 3 stars."
"gemma was extremely rude to my sister when she walked in to get a haircut. she sat down and immediately gemma started criticizing my sisters hair and implying that she did not want to cut my sisters hair. my sister finally got uncomfortable and left, gemma seemed pleased by this. don't go here, they lost two customers in the span of 3 minutes."
"5 stars !!! a hidden gem ! had an outstanding haircut with nina today!!! i have very fine medium length hair which is hard to grow long without lots of special care and treatment. pair that with my [prior] dislike for actually getting a haircut and you have some seriously split ends! i finally caved in and decided to get it trimmed after work today. it had been about 1.5 years since my last cut and it was noticeably crispy at the bottom (yea, not a word you'd want to use to describe hair) !this was the best haircut i've had! the actual haircut/trim (not including the consultation), took about 5 mins and i could tell and even more so, feel the difference immediately. nina really respected my wishes for the appointment and is very trustworthy if you're worried about too much hair going missing lol.  i'm a wash and go type, so this was absolutely perfect for my personality -my ideal haircut is no more than 10 mins and pretty much in and out. my hair is also easy to cut because of the texture/light weight. i'm sure if you wanted a more styled cut, and lots of time taken, that nina would also be good for you. i just want to emphasize that my haircut wasn't rushed at all- it was exactly what i wanted. the ability to understand the client well and respect their needs is a true gift that nina has in spades. i've been to several high end salons & spas, aveda salons, and four different supercuts locations besides this one, but i've never felt as comfortable or been as happy ! there was no wait time, the salon is easy to find and very clean. also seems child friendly. i will absolutely be back, i've already recommend nina to two of my friends, and having such a positive experience really changed the way i see getting a haircut :)"
"horrible! i went there thinking that nothing could go wrong since i only wanted a simple layered bob. i was so wrong!! i am irritated and shocked that this woman has a license to cut hair. she butchered my hair,it looked like a 5 year old did it. before i left the salon,i knew it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. but when i left and really took a good look,everything was un even!! i took some of the photos of my poor hair. i didn't make a scene at the salon because i am not the type of person who does that,i really thought i could grow it out and wait for another haircut. it was horrendous that i had to fix it at the same day at another salon. i don't know who did my hair because she didn't introduce herself. she had curly hair and that's all i know. do yourself a favor and do not go to this salon!! they will ruin your hair!"
"i came in for a haircut and specified that i would not  like my shoulder-length hair to be cut short: i wanted only a trim and a haircut that mostly shaped my existing haircut.  i was asked to remove my glasses which meant i could not see what was going on.  when kamla was done, i had a super- short cut and even though it was not bad as haircuts go,  i was shocked and quite unhappy.  i will return to gemma next time."
"be prepared to wait, even if you have an appointment. the app the company uses needs to be improved.gemma is wonderful at what she does. she has been in the business for countless years. hair stylists are good at what they do, and listen. super cuts is for an affordable hair cut.if you are a man, great. they will take you before anyone else - even if you have an appointment."
i got an outstanding cut and color by jeff today after work! i had great conversations and walked away reinvention! highly recommend!!
"i've been back a couple of times now, including getting a trim by nina as well as a trim a few months ago by another woman.  i have no idea what happened to tony but so far there have been no mishaps with my trims.  i've never gotten my hair washed or blown out at supercuts, just trimmed which is fine for $18.76 + tip."
i went here once. i got a trim. she cut my hair uneven. next haircut i got they had to fix it. never will use supercuts again. you get what you pay for when it comes to haircuts usually. i learned that the hard way.
"just got a wash and cut from rosie, she is such a nice and sweet person and an awsome hairdresser. i am soo hooked with her. loved the cut and she gave me tips to soft my hair. i am gonna be a regular here from now on... ask for rosie she is best."
"excellent service at a reasonable price. i typically pay 70 dollars to get my hair cut, but i need to start budgeting now and can unfortunately no longer afford to go to my favorite salon. i was very satisfied not only with the service, but with the quality hair cut that i received from this salon. i will definitely be returning!"
was one of the finest experiences i had. got my hair done in $20 and the service which was provided to me was really great. would surely recommend this to a friend of mine.
"donna gave me the best blowout and was quick, friendly and professional.  intend to go back for cut and color."
"alainya was great! i have very long hair and getting a hair cut stresses me out. i explained what i wanted, she repeated to me and explained in detail, and did a great job. i will definitely be back!"
"i was really skeptical about going here since i hadn't been since i was a child, haha, but being on a budget you have limited options in nyc. i have long curly hair and not everyone knows how to cut it properly without making me look ridiculous. however nina did the greatest job! i am in love with how it looks now!! definitely will be going back to her from now on. everything from booking the appointment to the price everything was such a great experience."
"i had pretty much given up on getting my hair colored in salons since no one seemed to be able do it right. tony suggested a red violet brown and my hair looks beautiful! in addition to being a true professional, he is also a great friendly guy to spend a couple of hours with."
sad that at 20 minutes before closing they lock the door. wanted to buy some product but sweeping girl flat out ignored me.  lost a customer in me - plenty of other places to go
just went in today as a walk in and was very well taken care of.  i was just looking for a place where i could go on my lunch break but i was also tired of the high prices of other places.  i am happy i was able find both.  chelsea was my stylist and did a great job.  she took time to listen to what i want to have done.  all the great reviews of her here on yelp are well deserved.  i'm glad i'm not the only one.  definitely an asset for the salon.  great prices and great service.  looking forward to going back next month.
i don't think i'll be taking my son back here. i could have done a better job myself. my son was there last week for a cut and i said to keep it long without layers. the girl was very nice that cut his hair but the more i look at it the more it pisses me off. it's hair and will grow back but the girl needs additional training. it's unacceptable!
"chelsea was my stylist and she was great!  i was a bit apprehensive because i hadn't had my hair cut in sometime and it was a bit straggly looking.  she cut about 2"" and gave me a nice blow out.  she also answered my questions about how to cover my grays.  service was immediate and prompt.  i will be back to see chelsea so she can cover my grays and give me a conditioning treatment.  price is right.  this location may be hard to find.  its directly behind the strip mall that houses shoe carnival, gap outlet, five below, etc.  supercuts faces the acme."
chelsea did a wonderful wash and blow dry on me. she's very meticulous and cheerful which leads me to always come back to her. her attention to detail is amazing. conversation is always great and she makes me feel comfortable and at ease while sitting in her chair. i'm not a fan of chain salons but i'll always make sure i get my cut and blow dry with chelsea!
"i stopped in yesterday, 7/19/15,  to get a haircut. everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating. did not have to wait at all. christina gave me an awesome cut that i really love! i definitely recommend her, she gave me exactly the cut and style i was looking to achieve:)"
"this is a beautiful shop.  the girls are all very nice.  chrystal gave me a great haircut and the prices are so reasonable.  i go to supercuts every time i need my hair done, but this is my first visit to this location. very nice."
hit or miss place. the newer stylists haven't been fully trained. i leave with chunks of long hair. at times i end up getting good cuts.
the prices are standard...i got what i asked for and was pleased with the result. when i came in there was only one worker there so i gave a four star review because of the wait. the worker did a good job but they need people at the reception to take calls and checkout those that at finished.
"greeted nicely by all stylists when i arrived. checked in and was taken quickly (only a few people were waiting). ashley gave me a wash, cut, and blow dry and did an excellent job. i have long thick curly hair and i wear it straight. she spent all the time needed in blow drying it straight with an awesome curl/wave at the ends. this was my first time to supercuts and i would return to ashley again.  the atmosphere was quiet but welcoming and friendly. the only reason i wouldn't give it a 5-star has more to do with the actual aesthetics of the salon. the carpet is worn as are the seats in the waiting room. i have been to a couple other similar salons in the area (master cuts, great cuts, hair cuttery, etc) and they are all a lot ""nicer"" to be in while waiting. that being said - i would rather sit in a shabbier spot and get a great haircut than wait in a brand new shiny place and leave unhappy!!!"
"due to a poor vacation over sight  a simple knot in the back of my hair became a complete crown of a matted mess. i bought every detangling product on the planet worsening the situation. i allowed this problem to fester for three weeks! as my hair is about almost two feet long as i am growing it out to get married in two months. all of it stood like a cone on top of my head. i was doomed. my mother, a dog groomer, said i had no choice but to cut it out. i was terrified my groom and i would have the same hairstyle for the wedding. i called to make an appointment with complete embarrassment and was met with encouragement they would try to salvage as much hair as possible. upon arrival i was greeted with a warm welcome from a women named jess w. who explained in detail every avenue she would take to help. customers in the salon we're in shock at my hair. i was heartbroken by the customers face because i knew they would cut off my hair. jess laid her hand on my shoulder and said let's get started we're going to be here awhile because we're not cutting anything. we spent the next 2.5 hours together. she reinforced there was nothing to be embarrassed about. held conversations as if we were best friends all while hiding any symptom of fatigue in her hand or back. she did it to make me feel comfortable. that gesture alone awed me. well truth be told she never took her scissors out!  she made a miracle happen. after the last knot was brushed she did not say were done. she leaned over and said i'm going to give you the best shampoo you have ever had. in deed it was. she even offered to throw my hair in braids so it would not knot over night. i plan to make this my only destination for hair beauty. if you can request your consult. request jess w you will not be disappointed. she's a miracle worker"
i had an appointment on a sunday afternoon with tina for a cut & color. i was taken back a few mins after i arrived. the staff greeted me warmly as i entered. tina took the time to talk to me about what i wanted done and discussed my color with me. i walked out extremely satisfied and pleased with my cut and color.  i will definitely be returning. tina is an amazing stylist and extremely professional.
"so i checked in online and it said no wait. i get to the salon and there are two ladies being serviced. i get no acknowledgement from any employees and am ignored for now going on 35 minutes. i'm about to walk out. this is absolutely the worst supercuts i've ever been to and management needs to be replaced as i've seen i'm not the only one who has these feelings.  in addition, the app serves no purpose as i had to check in again when i arrived."
so i am here now and have been waiting to get my haircut for about 25 mins. i checked in at the kiosk but the staff has not given me even 1 update about when i will get called up.  in addition people have been coming in based on earlier reservations made.  so...do people who walk in keep getting bumped back like those trying to fly standby?  the staff doesn't seem very friendly or approachable either. will update this after i finally get a haircut.
"i've gone to this particular supercuts for the last year. the stylists are all pleasant and personable and i always have a good cut. they definitely know what they're doing.that said, the management of this particular establishment is pretty dismal. on a few occasions there haven't been enough workers to cope with the clientele load and there are frequent walk outs which cuts my wait time but you'd think they'd be able to maximize service by having at least 3 working at any given time.the computer check in system should be able to tell the timing and walk out rate and they could tailor schedules to the metrics. but i guess that's just me."
"consistently customer focused with great quality.  i have been coming here since 2006 (nearly 9 years). i am really happy with the prices and how they do my cut and color.  they are pleasant, friendly, and customer focused.  a tip:  they are not very organized at filing the color cards.  my last name is often misspelled and hard to find, takes a little extra time.  a couple times, my card was never found during the last year.  you would think this would be a problem for me, but it isn't.  the staff is so good at what they do that they can talk to me, look at me, and then....i get a color i like better than the last one.  so if they lose your card, don't worry!"
"went there and got my sons hair cut. it came out really nice, she did it exactly how i wanted it!  also i got my eyebrows waxed...  the lady did a very nice job as well! she is the second lady that i would now trust to do them!   i would go back there again"
"my son had a bit of a haircut emergency at 8:20 on a tuesday night. i called 3 hair cuttery's and all of which answered the phone as if i bothered them and were closed or closing even though it said 9:00 online. i called super cuts. they answered the phone pleasantly and assured me they do not close until closing time. they take their ""last customer"" at 9:00. they sounded as if they would appreciate my business and now i'm happy to give it to them.the stylist was evelyn. thanks evelyn!"
"i wanted to give a shout-out to tara at this location. yesterday i had gotten my hair colored and cut with my stylist in king of prussia (who i'd been going to for well over a year without incident). for some reason that stylist went rogue on me and f'ed up my color and cut. i am leaving the country in several days and didn't want to be seen looking the way i did. first thing this a.m. i went to this villanova location as a hail mary to see if something could be done last-minute before i left town. tara assessed the damage and offered up solutions. my hair was so brassy and over-highlighted that the toner wasn't quite doing the trick to tone it down. tara stuck with it and my highlights look so good and blend with my base color so much better!! i appreciated her attention to detail and care in making sure she did all she could. next, she corrected the weird haircut i had received - my stylist likes to use the razor blade to create layers vs. cutting them in with scissors. for my hair type it just looks too choppy and isn't blended well at all. tara got to work fixing that hot mess.so, at the end of my supercut visit, tara greatly improved my hair color so that i'm no longer embarrassed walking down the street and my kids can no longer make fun of me - plus i no longer look like chunks of gum were cut out of my hair!! phew. such a relief to walk out the door feeling confident about how my hair looks! thank you, thank you, tara!"
i'm not going to give this more than a single star. i live not far from this location. so other than convenient - that's it. the staff is very rude. they discourage people from waiting and exaggerate the wait times. i've witnessed it nearly every time. also - the place is filthy.!!!! every time i've gone i noticed a rash on my arms and neck  from the chairs. they don't sanitize their instruments or wipe down the chairs and there are piles of brushes around the damp sink. it's really gross. i'm not sure they even wash the robes. it's really unpleasant. never ever  again.
"this is the place to go!from the get go, as i entered in everyone greeted me with a smile and just the overall vibe of the store was inviting. i was checked-in and had very little wait time and was immediately seen by my 'stylist' of choice (trish). fyi - there are multiple ways to get check-in as they have the mobile app, or direct call-ins that you can do to schedule an appointment as well as they take direct walk-ins. everyone has a horror story or two about getting their hair cut and having someone try to do what they would like when getting their haircut. i have quite a few and as i have been trying to find a stylist who not only knows what she's doing but has great customer service for the past 4-5 years... and i finally did! trish is a gem i found! even though hair grows back and mess-ups can be fixed this way, trish is someone that always has made me not worry about my look or cut, but also someone who i trust. now, i get my money's worth and not always having an issue month to month with my dew.i recommend this supercuts location. i also recommend seeking trish if you're looking for great customer service and a great finished haircut everytime. after my recent visit, i noticed that all the other customers were satisfied with their stylist as well - so you can't go wrong here.from what i discovered, this is a new supercuts location that popped up in the villanova area. not only is everything just clean, new and updated compared to other locations - it has a nice inviting set up to really just give that local barbershop/hair salon feel. it's all topped off with great workers/stylists that just make the place inviting... go check it out!!"
"my two little kids got great haircuts here from gracie. they are both a little nervous and not very excited about haircuts. they came in with long faces clinging to my leg but ran out skipping and laughing, just like that scene in naked gun when the couple comes out of the movie theater after watching platoon. overall the haircut was great and gracie was extremely nice and accommodating! we will be back!"
"since opening, this is where i get my hair cut because it is the closest to my home. i am not that particular when it comes to my hair, and will always allow whichever stylist is available to perform my generic male haircut. the last two haircuts i received were awful. bad to the point of going to a competitor for a ""fix"". needless to say i think i have given up on this supercuts."
another great experience at super cuts. friendly accommodating staff who are happy to be working there.
"i've been going to supercuts for well over a decade and to the drexel location for perhaps 3yrs. i have never been disappointed in the service and the prices remain more than reasonable. today, however, the staff were especially accommodating and were friendly as could be. they really brightened what was shaping up to be a rather unpleasant and frustrating day...and i got a great cut to boot (per usual). my regret is that i am unable to recall my stylist's name so as to thank her personally. i will continue to patronise supercuts at drexel for as long as i'm in this area and will be sure to recommend it to any and all. thanks, guys!"
"been here three (maybe four) times for quick trims since they opened, but my most recent visit will be my last. i realize that i am a much more ""mature"" client than this location typically sees, and i have had very short hair for 35 years now so there are not a lot of styling options. when i went in, i explained that i just wanted a trim and, if possible, some shaping to take out some of the ""bulk"" of my thick, wavy hair. i showed the stylist two pictures of haircuts i liked. we talked about how the stylist felt both my style and my color were aging me. i agreed and said i hoped a little shaping would help and i trusted her, because after all - hair grows back. (it was a joke!!)i was asked if i minded if she used clippers in the back. i said no, i didn't mind because most past stylists used them on the edges in back and on my neck - i have a low hairline. then i felt the clippers going straight up the back of head....over and over again. and i felt the scissors going across the back of my head....higher and higher. at this point i said something lame like ""that feels awfully short"" and the response was ""it'll grow back."" i was asked if i wanted the length on my bangs cut. i said no - i just wanted them textured to be wispier. she agreed... and then cut them to be about 1/2 inch long. needless to say: i am horrified to report that i look like i was attacked by a weedwacker. yes it will grow back eventually....but with a few tears and lots of embarrassment in the meantime."
"i got a really bad haircut from here. the layering was uneven and i got short layers even though i specifically asked for long layers. the layers in the back are 3+ in shorter. also, the cut is very blunt. they gave me a refund because they know they messed up. i have to go get it fixed now but i will definitely never go back here."
"three stars? are you serious? this place is a definite 5 star establishment. the staff was fun, friendly, and helpful. my stylist, jasmyn, not only gave me the best fade and trim i've had in years, but also great conversation about cosplay, her new line of all natural hair products, and just life lol. don't pay attention to all the negative reviews and book your next appointment here!"
i had been wanting to find a new place in philly and usually i try to find high end places but i decided to try it out and i was very pleased. i didnt get my hair cut but i got a partial with a red and purple color done. jessie was amazing and they didnt have the first colors for me first time around but i went a second time and she redid the color on the house and i was super appreciative of it! i'll definitely be seeing her for future hair appointments:)
"this was my first time at a supercuts in philly, as i usually go to south philly salon, but, i was in the neighborhood and not available on my usual day, so, i decided to try it. as soon as i arrived, they instructed me to sign in (online) . i had one person ahead of me, so, wait time was less than 5 minutes. the stylist, was friendly, professional and cut my hair precisely how i asked. i asked after cut, if i used correct terminology, and she replied ""yes"".. i will come back if i am crunched for time and cannot make it to my south philly salon. the haircut didn't take long and it looks good. thanks."
"i have very curly hair and i've been trying to find a good, cheap haircutting spot for the longest- i finally found it. vernessa really listened to everything i asked for and even gave some curly tips for me to use, she knows how to cut curls! for all the curly headed girls that don't wanna spend 250$+, for 25$ this is honestly a deal, i'll def be coming back again !"
"don't go here, this is the worst haircut i have ever had.  this place is enticing because it is so reasonably priced but they will make you look stupid.  i had bangs and i wanted them to be a little more full, the staff just chopped a thick piece of my hair without consideration.  she looked aghast when she looked at me, she knew she effed up my bangs.  honestly, if it came down to supercuts or shears in the bathroom... i would take my chances with the shears, and i have no experience at all.  booo!"
"honestly one of the worst haircuts i've ever gotten. i got the girl in the front seat to the left on a slow saturday afternoon. she rushed through my haircut and didn't bother cleaning up the back (usually a decent barber would ask a man if they want the back..rounded or square) when i asked her to clean up my neckline, she gave a condescending attitude as if i asked her to glue my hair on and start again."
"the staff here is all very friendly. that being said, no one cares if you have a nice hairdresser when you have a rough hair cut.  it wasn't even that he cut it too short (which he did) it just seemed like such a scraggle-y technique. i know during other haircuts they have a way they cut it so it doesn't have a blunt looking cut, but this was like that in a very chunky, unnatural looking way.for $20 plus tip, next time i'll  be going somewhere better with a groupon promo or something, little better quality."
"venssa is the best, she is a professional and so friendly. i came with an orange hair after bleaching she fixed it. so glad with the result.i just gave 4 stars for the entire stuff but venessa deserves more than 5"
"after hearing and reading so many positive reviews about this place, i just had to give it a try. the staffs are nice people and i felt like i can come here for all my future hair cuts, but it turns out to be the top worst place that i've ever gone to. i had long hair and asked for a new look, specifically the type of hair i mentioned, and in the end the barber only spent about 10 minutes cutting and trimming my hair. the results  shocked me and left me feeling embarrassed walking outside back to my room. i could get a way better haircut in connecticut, and for cheaper, if i was back home. before, i have heard of the guy, by the name of kevin, from most reviews, and that he is best barber to go to, but unfortunately i went with someone else. i am now stuck with this awful haircut that could not be fixed. because of my first bad experience here, i will never plan on coming back here again and recommend that everyone should find a better supercuts or a new place to go."
"okay okay excuse my ""elite yelper b#%^ syndrome"" from the last review.  this time i went back again, sarah was amazing!!!! she took her time with trimming my hair and did a great job. kevin and sarah were so friendly and attentive with the guests who were waiting. honestly when you have one bad experience with a staff doesn't mean that the whole team is not satisfying. ladies. please request sarah when you go in!!! !!"
"i have been here twice in the past 6 weeks. supercuts is comically known to my friends as the ""fast food"" of haircuts as they are usually inexpensive and quick. i don't mind this business model and find it useful when you are in a rush. i have read the reviews about this location and agree with the former customers. the employees here do not seem to cut hair that well. they got me in and out quicker than most other supercuts franchises i have been to and pretty much did a superpar job. i dont understand why they don't wash your hair like other franchises as well. i hope next time i go i dont feel like i am being rushed out in such a short time, especially when no one is waiting for a haircut"
"its not about the prices , its about the process. right now it is sat morning more then 14 people waiting and 1 barber!! this is upsetting and very unpromising when advertised quick and qualitative. im sure the manager will reply oh i am sorry about the experience from what i see its a lack of leadership and team effort. she even forgot to sign me in and still intended to call people before me !!! this is a joke ...... and last time i have posted this on fb until this process changes i will withdraw my comment"
"kevin the manager is here! i loved him in wynnewood, i am so happy to know that i can still get my hair blown out by the best!"
great experience and an amazing cut. finally supercuts is on campus. thanks melissa! you're awesome.
"ok, here is the thing, my hair is hard and thick, but it can't be the reason for you to stretch my scalp with your sharp clip! and also, the details are super terrible! i wouldn't hate you for the awful haircut, but please! practice more!"
"kevin did a great job on my hair, blow dried it, and made it look fabulous! deforest will be using them for mine and my husband's hair cuts. quality haircuts for a great value. thanks kevin!"
"never written a yelp review before, but this is the worst haircut i've ever received. asked for half my current length and the stylist took that to mean an eighth as long, and, in order to make it look less wrong, trimmed the sides shorter. unfortunately, this wasn't even and so now i have hair wings on my sides like a mediocre pegasus. matching this pegasus look, she left several ""horse tails"" on the back of my head (at the original length), which i had to pull out. bad."
"stopped in without an appointment to get my face cleaned up. they were able to accommodate me, and i left out with a nice even beard trim."
i just moved to philly and i was trying to find an inexpensive barber to just get a simple cut and supercuts was the only barber that was under $20 (it is $18 for just a cut). i went and the people were friendly and got me setup. within a minute or two i was in the chair and a stylist was asking me what i wanted. i don't recall the stylists name but she was young and probably very new because she didn't seem to understand how rough she was being with the razor. about halfway through my cut she poked me with the scissors which was more annoying than painful but is part of the reason i can't give 5 stars. overall the price was okay if a bit on the expensive side compared to what i am used to and the atmosphere and attitude of the stylists was great but the actual cut was rough even though it ended up looking good in the end.
"this review is regarding my hair cut and what i would consider an unethical practice...i have been to this location several times, however i will not be returning to this location. while waiting to be seated the stylist helping me was finishing up with another client. at the end of the cut i saw her grab an instagram/ facebook picture frame. she held this up so the clients face was in the frame, and quickly grabbed her phone to take a picture. i could see the client in the chair was confused about what was happening. he had no clue what she was holding up because she did not turn it to make it visible, nor did she tell him or ask him if she could or wanted to take a picture. at the end of my hair cut she tried to do the same thing, however i quickly stopped her as she grabbed her phone. again she did not ask permission or indicate her intentions. on top of this i asked for finger length on the top however the stylist should have told me that she has very small fingers because it turned out to more look like i had a full out buzz cut. i just left from a supercuts near my work. i told the stylist about my last experience, how she cut my hair extremely short and about the instagram/facebook photo frame situation. the stylist was in shock when i told her about the pictures because she explained that this was for a contest. the store that could rack up the most pictures of their clients with the frame would win a prize, and a day they could wear jeans into work. she also told me that all of the photos taken were published on facebook. to top it off this location won the contest.your location won the contest taking photos of your customers without their consent or knowledge that the pictures would be published to facebook."
"i had to wait for my daughter to come out of a concert on south, and i tried this salon while i was waiting.  they had a special running for hair dye, and i figured, why not?  i have nothing but time!  cut and color for 35.00, can't beat it. trish is the girl that i was put with, she was so nice!  i've never had my hair colored (and i'm 45), i usually do it myself...but for the price, i couldn't turn it down.  trish was fast and thorough!  i was nervous because there were a bunch of men that kept coming in for cuts, and i wondered if they were any good on women's cuts.  she cut my hair and even razored the ends!  love it!  she was fast and did an excellent job on my locks....i didn't wash my hair for three days because i loved how she styled it. i wish i lived closer to this salon because i'd go every 6 weeks !  thank you trish!"
terrible haircut. uneven all over and styled similar to lloyd's in dumb & dumber. avoid.
"i've gone twice to this supercuts. the staff aren't particularly friendly. the first time was fine, i just got a trim and it was more or less what i wanted. the second time i went back it seemed like the stylist didn't know what she was doing. i told her i just wanted to trim off the dead ends. she cut more than enough off and though i asked her for layers, i got all one length and it looks terrible. i will definitely not being going back here."
"terrible!  i went for a blow out and style which i asked them to curl it- it was awful- i had to go home and redo it myself. i thought something so basic would be easy but i was wrong. on top of it, they were super unfriendly!!  it's s shame because i try to give these chains the benefit of the doubt, but i will not be going back...just goes to show if you need even a basic service to go to a real salon. stay away!"
"i usually give these guys the benefit of the doubt and it's pretty cheap but the last few times i've gone there, they've really messed up my hair, and i wear a very simple style (and takes about 15 mins). it seem more lack of care and willingness to provide extra effort with some of their new hires. will be looking for other options in the area"
"before i moved out of queen village, i would stop by this supercuts on occasion for affordable waxing and impromptu trims if i were too impatient to wait for someone at work to do it.  they earn back one star for the stylists i ended up seeing there, whom i would recommend and go back to if the opportunity presented itself.  i have gotten waxing done by trish a few times--she is thorough, gentle, and friendly.  as i was checking out after an appointment with her, i made conversation with another stylist, tim, whose style i really liked, so i figured i would ask for him on my next visit.  that i did, and he was fun to chat with and did an awesome job on my hair! i also saw him for waxing once and he is great with that as well.  on that note, should you visit this location, make sure you request trish or tim!"
i just read a negative review on this site about brandi & i was floored. i'm guessing there was another reason for this negative review especially when you make it personal about the way a person looks and there genes and not about the job. brandi is remarkable and adorable. she cuts my son & my husband's hair and does an amazing job.
"i called to make an appointment (they don't take appointments i learned) with someone who has expertise in cutting curly hair. both the receptionist and the manager were really unhelpful and rude when i kept asking if there were specific people in the salon who cut curly hair and have had the most experience cutting curly hair. they just kept saying everyone has had the same training. as a person with curly hair who has gotten some pretty awful cuts over the years, ""the same training"" is not in any way reassuring. i've had plenty of people with ""training"" mess up my hair cut. it is not true that just anyone can cut curly hair, or rather they can cut it, but not well. their lack of help was very disappointing, as was their attitude. i was looking forward to trying them as they are in my neighborhood and affordable but sadly i will not."
i give this place two stars. i had two different cutters and three visits. try try again. each time i had to adjust shaping and short hair adjusted around ears and needed a trim again really in two weeks. the two haircuttery also did similar cuts.. the supercuts cut!! it is certainly worth the $20 then for this non haircut...
i've been getting my hair cut by brandi at supercuts for about two years and she does a great job. i have incredibly curly hair and she seems to know just how to cut it. if you have curly hair ask for her.
i was just astounded by a review i just read on yelp about brandi.. i was completely in a bind and i needed my hair colored totally last minute. i arrived at supercuts at 8:45 on june 21st. i was taken by brandi for a full ombré color . i felt totally horrible about the situation & brandi pleasantly did my hair even though i didn't leave the salon until 11:15 (which i presume was much past their closing ) i am a complete believer in yelp reviews & i can't believe yelp kept such a unreliable review about brandi! there seems to be an underlying problem that chris j has with brandi & i hope my faith yelp will investigate this review
"i have been going to this location for about 5 years now and everyone in there is extremely friendly and welcoming. the manager, mary, always greets me with a warm hello every time i walk through the door. i've received many great cuts there but ever since brandi showed up i get my haircut from her when she's around because it's exactly what i want every time! i couldn't ask for a more consistent, friendly, professional stylist! as a retail manager myself, i can say she is the type of person every business would want on their team. keep up the great work, brandi!"
"i've been getting weekly blow outs her by tina, she is awesome!  it would be great if the frequent buyer program could apply to blow outs, they are more costly than a haircut. i'll keep coming back and will refer tina."
"usually when people talk to me about my hair and what products i've tried it's one of my more enthusiastic conversations. i can talk about 4 odd things really intensely: candy, dogs, working out, and curly hair products. you probably usually touch on these subjects as small talk and if you're talking to me all of a sudden you'll find themselves taking notes while i'm showing you random websites on your phone. the curly hair products obsession is because of the mixed-race thing. i think there will be more and more of us in the future and so i want to be ready to advise those future 1/4 germans 1/4 jamaicans 1/4 croatians 1/4 japanese what to use. so when people ask me: where do you get your hair cut????? i'm always mumbling ""supercuts"".... like realllly mumble. ask me three times and you still can barely hear me. and i admit, it's because i'm a little embarrassed that the hair product combination i use is way more expensive than the place i get my hair cut. i get it. it's not fancy. i think a 19 year old cut my hair the other day. but i don't care! it's a curly hair thing. if all i need is a trim, then supercuts is just great. i'm easier than a dude because my hair springs back and you can't tell if it's uneven or not. so why pay $50 at a salon for a regular trimming? no thank you ma'am. sure if i'm getting something fun and new done i've gone other places. otherwise i'll take a $20 trim and shampoo from these cats any time. and they're not pretentious at all about it. they're happy to see me and easy going. thumbs-up."
omg - a big 5 stars for melissa (not missy!) who has now been cutting my 6 year old's hair since september.  she is great (the place - probably 3 stars - but she gets 5).  so patient and great with my little one.and for $12 - what a deal!!thanks again to danny bonaduce (love him!  and he married amy - a yelper - so go danny!) for sending us to supercuts.they make my kiddo supercute.
"got my hair cut here last night.  needed a quick walk-in haircut due to a last-minute trip to visit family in canada.my haircut certainly was quick (earning this joint one star), but i can honestly say that i am currently sporting the worst haircut for which i have ever paid $17, and possibly one of the worst haircuts i have ever seen.to describe the cut itself: high and tight on the left side (scalp visible about two inches above the left ear), not nearly as high and not nearly as tight on the right side. some jennifer aniston-style layering (unrequested) on the one side, uneven sideburns, and a patch of loose hair on the neck.the hair dresser's name was alex (possibly), but it's hard to tell because everything happened so fast.  the only time she spoke was to offer me a monotone list of upsells: ""any waxing?  any coloring?  any hair products?  want your eyebrows done?""  she finished my awful haircut in about three minutes then ran to the register without offering me a chance to even look at the back.  i was so put off by her repulsive attitude that i just handed her a twenty and scooted out the door.  i guess i figured, ""i paid money for this haircut.  how bad could it possibly be?""i found out this morning at work, when at least five of my coworkers asked me if i had cut my hair myself. needless to say, i shant be returning to the ol' supercuts in this lifetime.  i write this review in an attempt to caution any and all potential supercuts victims."
"the female stylists are great listeners (especially brandi) and gave me the type of cut i wanted each time. the male stylist, however, seemed to go his own way both times i let him cut my hair. i have short, thick, curly hair. the first time, i figured i'd just let it grow and i'd get over it, as the curls will cover any unevenness. the second time, however, he completely butchered my natural part and the way my hair lies on its own. this was over 6 months ago and my hair is -still- an uneven mess. i am trying to let it grow out before i go see one of the more high-end stylists in the city to fix the mess on my head. very displeased. if you're particular about your style, it's worth it to pay for better service elsewhere."
"great place to get your haircut at, super reasonably priced as well. i highly recommend mike, whom has been cutting my hair for about 2 years. he has cut it when it's short and long, and i'm always pleased.  the other stylists are great as well.  always super friendly and efficient. be sure to try the app for more convenience and a shorter wait time!"
horrible customer service.  do not use this location.  my wife walk in with my son. and they basically lied and said there was a 3.5 hour wait when there was only two people there and three stylists there.  and not that many people checked in.  they just didn't want to cut a kids hair.  if you have a kid done go here. they are not kid friendly and down right rude.  this is the second time something like this happened.
"don't bother checking in online. still had to wait an hour after i showed up to get my haircut. they had 3 people stocking shelves, 2 at the register, and only 3 cutting hair. mike was a chill dude though"
"i checked in online an hour ago, somehow i still have to wait another half hour. slowest mediocre haircut that $20 can buy."
"fool me once, shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me. i can't believe i make the mistake of returning to this place again and again. it's quite frustrating. the name of this place should be re-labeled to hit or miss. i figured, hey it's sue. she did a pretty good job on my hair last time. nope. she spent way less attention to detail to my back like the last two times i got a cut from her. maybe it was because it was an hour before closing time, i'm not sure. i told her, like i tell everyone who cuts my hair to leave the top long (at least a fingerlength) which she readily acknowledged at the start of the haircut. however, she just kept snipping quickly and by the time i realized, it was too late. if i pull with the tips of my fingers, maybe i can get a cm of hair from my scalp. seriously. additionally, it takes a while for me to grow my hair back. there's a certain trust you give to a person to let them cut your hair. when they royally screw up time and again, they should lose that privilege. the last thing i want to do after a long day of work when i'm tired is scrutinize my barber's work in real time and stop them every other minute to make sure they're doing what they're supposed to be. if anything, it is the barber who should stop and ask ""is this too long, should i cut some more?"" this never happens at supercuts. people only go to this place because it's convenient, quick and easy. but at $18 it's clearly not worth it. i would rather spend much more and get a decent haircut so i'm taking my money elsewhere from now on . i will be searching for a new place on yelp and elsewhere. if you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know. i urge you to take your money elsewhere."
you get what you pay for. crappy hair cut. will be going to another salon to get it fixed. worst hair cut of my life.
"worst bangs trim ever!!! avoid this place. i left with my bangs still soaking wet, and had to go home and recut it because she missed a huge chunk and it was crooked. my 3yo would have done a better job!"
"hit or miss. the revolving door of employees clearly states the type of environment here.  5 people waiting, only two stylists working.  it's often like this when i come. understaffed and always a wait.  the staff is friendly for the most part but this company needs to get their act together. you pay for what you get. cheap haircut, cheap service."
"have been coming to this supercuts for many years. marie is the only person to cut and color my hair. she is patient, courteous and always honest about what will work/not work for my hair."
"i went there for a walk in, they didn't tell me i had to check in on their computer screen. people then came in and checked in ahead of me. the employees then mocked me, don't go here."
"what is the point of signing-in online? we're still waiting for 45 minutes after the appointment time for the haircut! supercuts, please fix your online scheduling system!  you do not give your stylists enough time for appointments. on saturday mornings, why would you schedule only two stylists? once in the chair, all was good. friendly professional stylists but the wait is dreadful."
"today, i went into supercuts for a trim.  the only available stylist was katie...she was blonde and had tattoos, and was not friendly.  i told her i only wanted ""the minimum amount of hair"" off.  she took about 6 inches off.  i am absolutely horrified.  also, it did not seem like she knew what she was doing which made me nervous the whole time.i will never go back to this supercuts in my life.  usually i try to go to generic hair salons to save money on trims and high end salons for highlights.  from now on i'm sticking to high end salons for both trims and highlights."
great place! mike has a great personality and he us very creative. i love how he makes my hair look.
"edited to only include my disgust with the warts!!! i'm disgusted after my last visit to supercuts. during the shampoo service, or massage service rather, my stylist katie put her forearms all over my face as she washed my hair. we finish up at the washing station only for me to spot the giant uncovered wart that she had on her forearm. now she was just rubbing that arm all over my face. disgusting!!! if you're going to put your arms all over someone's face make sure you cover up your warts!!!!"
sue did a great job on my long hair cut just enough! had a great experience and the prices weren't bad at all. will definitely be back :)
"marie recently cut my hair and she was amazing!!!!!i hate getting my hair cut because i feel like stylists always try to pressure me into being more high maintenance than i naturally am, but marie listened to what i wanted while offering helpful suggestions."
"after moving to this area from the suburbs i tried many different barbers & hair salons. i finally struck gold at supercuts in roxborough. take my advice schedule appointment with katie let her do the tea treatment on your hair then get your haircut. you will be hooked for life. the tea treatment hair washing is so relaxing sometimes i come in just to get that done, whether i need a haircut or not."
"terrible customer service.  checked in online for a haircut at 11:30.  i show up at 11:25, all stylists are with customers and there are 2 other people waiting so i take a seat.  no big deal, i'm early and they are busy.  at 11:40 a man and his son walk in while all the stylists are still busy and the man announces ""i signed in online for 11:30"".  ok no big deal, obviously i was here first but no need for me to interrupt all the busy workers.  so then a seat up opens up for a haircut and this walks his son over there and the starts getting a haircut.  well, at least i'll be the next person to get a haircut.  then while another stylist was finishing the man announces, ""i also had an 11:30 checkin so i'm next"".  not wanting to get in argument with this guy i assume the employees will check the computer, ask if i was there first, or do something to double check if he was next.  nope.   he gets his haircut next.i finally get my haircut at 12:15.  i mention at the end to the stylist while paying, ""hey just to let you know i also checked in at 11:30 like those two, and i was here 15 min before them"".  all i wanted was an apology.  even a stereotypical customer service apology like ""i'm sorry for the inconvenience sir.""  but no.  nothing.  so i said ""i just didn't want to be rude and interrupt you guys when i walked in, and i figured my online sign in would put me in the computer"".  to which she responded, ""well that's the way you have to do it.""  oh really?  so every customer should come in and announce when they signed in and that they are next?  and still no apology.long story short, apparently moving to the back of the line was my fault for checking in online, showing up early, and then being polite when i showed up."
nice people clean shop! great fast service ! good price and nice selection of products!
"always great service from all the ladies and guy that run this shop. they're always relaxed and in a pretty chill mood. i am usually in and out of there fairly quickly...and they are very reasonable (17.00 for a guy + tip). they also do ""cool"" cuts if your looking for the new styles. the check-in app makes getting in and out even easier. good thing going up there."
"this supercuts is great! don't expect a five star haircut at a two star cost, but you will get prompt service and at least a decent cut for a very competitive price. checking-in with the mobile app makes things really easy."
just had one of the worst haircut experiences ever.  left loose hairs everywhere. i asked for a line. i left covered in hair. no hot towel or even a wipe down.had to correct her on using a 2. never even shown the back of my head before i was told it was done.
"i really only have experience with allie; she is fun, thorough, and gives a great men's cut!  she also seems to really be interested in coloring, trying a lot of mixes on herself."
"it was like a slow moving train wreck.  the receptionist said somebody would be with me shortly.  then a few min later she came back and surprise.  she's going to cut my hair.  i asked for a fairly standard men's cut - clippers on the side, take an inch off the top and blend.  she started off with the clippers but rather than blending toward the top she was moving my hair in all random directions and taking the clippers higher and higher looking for some magic line to stop at.  when she got to the top she put some kind of product in my hair and started cutting.  she kept making my hair it mohawk shapes as she cut.  so i'm pretty worried at this point as a big cowlick in the back is standing straight up and no part of the top is even.  then she moves on to the sideburns where she does one pass with the normal clippers leaving the hair half cut half way up.  finally she asks if its done.  is it done?!?  should she do something else?  at this point i'm in such horror i just want to run out and find a barber.  is she going to fix it?  no.   i get home and my wife looks at me in horror before she starts laughing.  hands down the worst hair cut in 25 years.  it's pretty short so not sure how i can fix this for at least a week or two.  i would say that this stuff depends on the individual stylist but if you employ somebody with this level of skill you have to wonder about all of the folks there.  so best to steer clear of this location"
i went in friday morning and the first indication i should have left was the fact all these haircut dummies were out on display and several employees working on it. i asked for a simple hair cut; short on the sides; long on top. 1 or 2 on the sides. the hairstylist clearly didn't hear me because she used the electric clipper right on top of my head. i stayed silent and in absolute shock as she cut a ton of hair from the top of my head. i was mortified. she left me buzzed cut. i wanted to leave and even gave her a tip. the cut was horrible i still had long strands of hair on the sides and it was uneven. i will never step foot in that establishment ever again. please train your employees.
"vince gave me an amazing shampoo/haircut experience today, really appreciated how efficiently he worked & cut my ends perfectly!"
"got turned away from supercuts because i got there 30 mins before they closed and they were ""too backed up"". i don't get this place, the employees mess with the system so u can't check in online properly and then turn you away. seems like very bad management. i guess i will be going to to great clips next time!! thanks for wasting my time."
"i still drive up from nc to see my stylist, alaina, at the wynnewood supercuts. she's the best."
"francine there is really truly talented at color, by the first time i went to her her highlights were fine and subtle and look so natural and she was genuinely happy and excited for the outcome of my hair. the second time they came out bleach blonde and she refused to tone them and i am unhappy with how streaky and stark they look.my appointment was later in the day and left my iphone charger there, by the time i had gotten home and realized they were close, and called the very next day to pick it up and it was nowhere to be found. shady. edit: found and returned! good on them :)"
dara was excellent and professional . hope to return again and book with dara. the app makes it easier. it's best paying $50 for a haircut....
"no.... seriously ...... take your time.   take a break between doing haircuts and go text and drink coffee and talk to the other employees when you have an entire waiting room of people.  this was typed in a sarcastic tone, by the way. no smiles, no ""welcome"", no making you feel as if anyone cares.  besides getting an awful haircut, i have never felt more like i was bothering the employees by being there."
"sumbal is the absolute worst!!!  she flat out lied, which i don't understand.  said she could cut a bob and then it became obvious she had no idea what a bob was.  so why lie???  worst haircut i've had in years and will take months to grow it out.  and one side is longer than the other.  barbara was the best but she left in the winter & there's been noone even close to replace her.  would give zero stars if i could.  the new manager is nasty also.  will never go there again"
"from check in to haircut to paying one of the worst customer service experiences i have had ever.  i have been going here for at least 10 years, almost all new staff.  i myself have a career in customer service and had anyone along the way would have listened and cared about my experience things would have been great.  we can never lose site why we are here in the service world whatever the price may be.  not too mention quality wise it was the worst haircut i have ever had, glad its just hair and will grow, although i will be wearing hars for a while.you have a great customer base in the community, without good service that will go away.after further thought i will not return to a supercuts again.  ten days later my haircut actually got worse as it grew in, uneven and just not good.  spoke with someone in customer service who mentioned a free haircut of which was never received or followed up on, not that i am interested in using it.  overall the company seems to be more interested in volune than quality and service as it used to be."
"i went there for a hair color of simple black and my roots came out blonde the stylist was truly inexperienced. i usually go to a high end salon in center city but thought i could save some time by staying in the burbs big mistake. i refused to pay for the terrible hair color i would never suggest going there for anything, terrible experience. don't waste your money on inexperienced operators"
"it's supercuts.  some of the stylists are better than others.  i took my kids here for years and only had one disappointing cut.i give this supercut props because more than once i saw stylists serving customers with a range of special needs and they were so gracious and easygoing with the customers, very professional."
"i've been meaning to write this because i found this woman on here and i'm so glad i did!  anyway, i'm not really a ""spend money on pampering myself"" kind of person, so when browsing around to find a spot to get a reasonably priced hair cut, i read some yelp reviews.  one such review mentioned a woman named flo as being superb....sooo, lucky for me, when i went to check in on the website, flo was working that day, so i booked with her.  now, let me tellll you...i felt like i was at the spa, i've never been to the spa, but flo sure made my experience ""spa-like."" i wish she could wash my hair everyday, all day...it was like that.  then she spent a decent amount of time cutting and straightening my hair to perfection which lasted like an entire week.  the whole time i was in the chair, i was thinking that the haircut was going to cost me an arm and a leg because some of the reviews i had read had warned about hidden charges, but flo charged me as advertised on the board.  my only regret is that i didn't tip her more; she still said it was a pleasure cutting my hair as i was leaving, but i assured her the pleasure was all mine.  i would absolutely go visit flo again!"
alaina is hands down the best stylist. she always saves my hair from myself. i love my cuts so much i also bring my two year old son and my husband to her! alaina is very talented and you won't regret booking your next appointment with her.
"went in to get my haircut and had a hooded sweatshirt, which i've worn several times without an issue. the haircutter, and older lady name started with a d, refused to cut my hair with it on. i then left, went around the corner and got an amazing cut at the barber shop with no issue. won't be returning."
"daughter treated me to a mothers' day haircut and we were happy to find that this place was open on a sunday!there was a good amount of people here but we waited less than 10 minutes. lucky me got kevin as my stylist - he was professional - fun to converse with - very knowledgable - and i will be going back because i felt confident that he can handle my hair. daughter was very happy with her cut and her stylist was also pleasant.the prices are very reasonable and next time i will get color done as well. left here feeling great, which is exactly how you should feel when you leave a salon."
i got my hair cut and blown out by a lovely lady named flo. she was wonderful. she gave me the best haircut i have had in a long time. she gave me an eyebrows wax and i looked 10 years younger when i left. i didn't even know they did waxing there. she is going to be my regular stylist from now on. thank you thank you flo
"thank you, michelle - not only did you fix the worst haircut of my life that i had gotten from elsewhere in drexel hill over the weekend, i absolutely love my new cut.  would recommend anyone looking for a professional stylist that understands the art of cutting hair to see michelle."
"michelle is amazing. somehow while multitasking her managerial duties at this busy supercuts, she also was able to focus on me as a client, which was not easy given my impulsive decision to chop off my elbow length hair and go with a super short cut. she is so talented and knowledgeable. i am sincerely grateful for her and hands down recommend her, especially if you're deciding to completely change your look. if you can't get michelle trust that the other stylists working keep open communication between each other. this is so important! every salon i have gone to has stylists working at different levels and when no one talks to each other, it is always a bad sign. i observed the stylists offering help to each other, asking questions, requesting feedback, and openly communicating in order to achieve the best results for the client."
after going to the same hairdresser for 17 years i took a chance and came here and i'm so glad i did! all i have to say is - go to michelle!!!! she gave me the prefect highlights and cut- everything i had asked for! very professional and a great head/neck massage during the wash!
"go to michelle! she goes above and beyond to meet your expectations while being professional and honest. whether it be a color, style or just a simple blow out- she's the best. also, if she washes your hair- be prepared to drift into a little piece of heaven. it's amazing. she truly cares about her customers needs/wants. not to mention she is super friendly and funny. it's nice to see someone so passionate about their job!! i always look forward to leaving the salon looking and feeling amazing! thanks michelle you rock!!!"
"michelle performed a miracle tonight.  she changed my pick hair to silver:)  i love it!  and it feels fabulous.  she used something new, marula oil by paul mitchell."
"best haircut in over 10 years! i have tried so many salons in the area, but michelle at this supercuts location is the best by far! she examined my hair prior to washing, really listened to what i wanted, and she relaxed me so much with her shampoo/scalp massage technique. then, she taught me tips to style my new do! i haven't felt this good about my hair in a very long time!"
michelle just gave me the best hair cut and color i have had in the past ten years!! she has a wonderful personality and took a lot of time and care with me.  she took the time to explain the the color choices and also the type of shampoo she would be using so my color would be soft.  such a soothing scalp massage -- i could have taken a nap.  my hair is wavy and the cut she gave was just perfect.  i will be recommending michelle to all my friends and family.  she is the best!
"great place to get a haircut. michelle is awesome! knows her stuff. i usually bring my kids with me and michelle always makes sure they get a braid, pigtails, or other surprise style after their haircuts. always leaves a smile on their faces. highly recommend!"
i love this supercuts location!  checking in online saves me time and i just earned a free cut through their new rewards system.  the entire staff is talented and professional.  i go to michelle who does the best blow dry i have ever had!  i would highly recommend.
i have two young children (1&3) and we use this supercuts for their haircuts. they get really busy so please remember to check in online before heading over to the store. they do a great job with both boys. especially the younger one who hates haircuts and squirms everywhere. prices are fair and you can get a frequent visitor card to get your 12th haircut free.
been here two or three times and the employees are less than interested in waiting on you. the haircuts are unimmpressive as well!
"i have been looking for a new stylist for awhile. since my horror of a haircut in march 2013, i have been very reluctant to even step foot inside a salon. yesterday was my breaking point and i just knew i had to do something. we all know that feeling, your hair is just done and you are over it. so i made the decision to get my haircut and i starting my research. i called a few places and asked questions but none of them really gave me a good feeling. then i called supercuts and spoke with julie. she immediately put me at ease and answered all my questions with no hesitation at all. this was just what i needed. i went to the location, and luckily it wasn't too far from my house. i walked in and took a look around. the place was clean and looked good. i was the only one there, which was fine with me since i am not a fan of waiting. i spoke to julie again and went over the cut i wanted and explained my past experience. (check out my review of hair-cut one hundred) again, she put me at east and totally understood what i wanted. i sat in the chair and off we went. she was awesome and showed me everything that she was doing. she put up with all my questions and indecisiveness. she was truly a professional.  i will definitely go back to see julie again. thank you julie for being just what i needed to get over my hair cut phobia lol"
"called and spoke with julie, she seemed knowledgeable and friendly. i went in with a very specific look and brought pictures. i was greeted with professional staff and welcoming smiles. julie and i spoke about what i wanted and as she cut we talked about the hair cut. i left very happy and couldn't wait to tell my husband so we could all start coming here. cut looked even better after i washed and blew it dry, she did exactly what i wanted."
"i got home with highlights that i didn't like, so i quickly went over to supercuts and alexis did a fantastic job! she used a sample book to discuss what i wanted, then mixed a nice shade of toner and applied it twice so my highlights were much tamer. next time i'm just going to alexis to begin with!also, my husband has been very happy with julie here."
"i am thrilled to have supercuts a walk away from my home in fairmount.  read reviews of people complaining about wait time-but i keep my wait expectations in check as calling ahead or signing up online is still not the same as scheduling an appointment.  sometimes it's slow and i walk right back, sometimes i wait...not a big deal.my favorite stylist is sophie - always pleasant and gregarious.  but her real talent is with color.  i go every five weeks to have my roots touched up and enjoy the salon environment as this is a multi-step process.  everyone is pleasant and seemingly enjoying their craft.  i look forward to returning in five weeks time."
"bad, bad bad system!!!so, i call. ""only one person ahead.  come over now""  i arrive, one person sitting.  i register, and the nice woman says, ""you'll be next with her"".  great. !"" 2 new people come in, sit down.  they registered online.  my""turn"" arrives, and my cutter takes another person.confused i ask:  ""can you explain your system here??  i called, was told to come in, one person ahead, and that i'd be next with you!""  ""i'm so sorry, they made a reservation online""  ""well, that's great.  i've been here 2o minutes expecting that what your colleague said was true :that i was next with you!""  ""well, we're short staffed..."" not about being short-staffed.  it's about being clear and communicating correctly.  you should have told me when i registered that several people had reserved online and that i could be bumped and bumped. cause now i'm pissed off, i'm going to walk out, never come back and write a bad review on yelp'  ""i'm sorry. have a nice day""  ""you just wasted 30 minutes of it"""
"this is my second time at the location and i have never been more impressed. the first time i thought maybe i just got lucky with who cut my hair but somehow this place is packed with highly-skilled, consummate professionals who are also good people. after most haircuts, i only look forward to the coming weeks when my hair grows out, but both times here i was actually happy to have someone mention that i got my hair cut. the only other place in the world i've gotten quality cuts is top notch barbershop back home and that costs 35 bucks. this is half the price and was probably even better."
courtney cut my hair today. she was so nice and personable and did a great job on my haircut. i  will definitely be going back to this salon and to courtney. i   checked in online and was seen right away. great experience!
"after my last visit i was extremely hesitant to come back, but finding out that the horrible 'stylist' was no longer there, i scheduled an appointment.i was just expecting to get my haircut and eyebrow waxing, but after showing beth a picture of the cut i wanted, she suggested that we add some color to accentuate my new cut and i was totally down.beth was so personable and professional that i immediately felt comfortable. she gave me a gorgeous haircut and stunning color. i've never been so pleased with my hair color either!i'm super happy with my hair and will definitely come back :)"
"i was walking down the street when i saw the supercuts on hamilton street. i was in desperate need of a haircut so i figured i would go in. at first i was a little hesitant because i have heard good and bad stories about supercuts. well, i'm glad i stopped in. the young lady who cut my hair, i can't remember her name but she was all tatted up, did a fabulous job. she was super friendly, outgoing and knew exactly what i wanted.i will definitely return for my next haircut and when i do i will get the young lady's name."
"i'm not one of those people who prefer to go to salons to get a haircut. i'm pretty basic and usually need a trim, maybe a bang trim, maybe some layers. because of i don't want to pay an arm and a leg for a haircut. some might say i'm taking a big chance but 99% i have been fine. this location opened last year in spring garden among some restaurants, nail salons, convenience stores, etc. it's clean and minimal, just how i like it.  i also like that you can check in online before you arrive. today was my second haircut here and it was $23 which included the shampoo and conditioning. originally i wanted a blow out but the girl who did my hair took a little long. but she was meticulous and attentive.would i go here for color services? no. but for the basics, this place is perfect."
called for an appointment asked if they could do 1:15 they took the appointment and there's 5 other people waiting for their cut when i show up. why not just say it's going to be 30 minute wait no matter when you show up? they don't respect your time at this establishment.
"i have been here several times and got a decent haircut for a good price.  i walked in today to get a haircut and sat there for over an hour waiting to get called up.  when i first came in there were only two guys ahead of me and then one after another ""online check-in"" walks in and goes in front of me.  i understand you have check-ins online, but you can't have a customer sit there over an hour, i will not be going there again."
"moved to philly five years ago and tried multiple places for haircuts.  i was thrilled to find sophie at supercuts.  i usually make sure it's a quiet time of day and just leave and return if it's too busy.  i used to bounce from place to place, but i love knowing supercuts is around the corner and open every day."
"i asked to get my hair dyed burgandy and the woman bleached my brownish blonde hair so it could come out more vibrant. but then when she first applies the dye, it came out practically black. she said it was ""a little dark"" and i was like ""a little?!?"" so she put in bleached shampoo to try to lighten it but the finished product was still a very dark reddish brown. i asked if she could lighten it and she said ""it will fade after a few washes."" but i've dyed my hair vibrant colors before and when you wash it, the vibrancy goes away too. so after a few washes i imagine it will turn dark brown. but even still, it's not the color i wanted now. and that's what she was saying to get me out of a refund i guess. i also paid for a waxing and i'm pretty sure she didn't know how to do that as well. you're supposed to go against the grain and do it in peices. but she put was one my whole stache and tried ripping it all off in one go, downwards with the grain. i didn't notice how bad the job was until the next day when the redness went away. there were still a few hairs leftover in very waxable places that i could have plucked myself. also i have short hair. maybe medium depending on who you ask. but it doesn't touch my shoulders. and one of the assistants told the hair dresser to charge me for long hair. i'm over here like ""excuse me?? does this look long to you??""so in the end i wasted $110 to damage and dry out my hair (because of the two bleaching process) dye my hair dark brown (which is more towards my natural color anyway) and get a less than decent waxing job that hurt like crazy. thanks."
"goodness this place sucks !!!! it's now 7:15pm... if i asked at 6:30pm ""how long is the wait"" and you say 10mins, what clock are you using??? fyi only one person was waiting besides me..and yes, he left a while ago... if i wasn't in a pinch i would've left!!"
"i have been to this location twice and had fantastic service from zoey! cut, color, and style have been superb. i like the paul mitchell products so much i bought some to take home and my hair hasn't looked for felt this good in a long time. --you can call and schedule and appointment on the day you want to come in or download the app and check in before you get there so the wait time is not as long. --prices are reasonable and they have specials every day of the week too"
courtney is a true skilled profesional. best haircut i've had in a long time.
husband took my son for a haircut since this place was close by and convenient on a sunday afternoon. thought he'd be in good hands as we've taken him to a different supercuts with great results.gave the woman specific instructions on how to cut his hair. even showed her pictures of how it's been cut in the past. the cut was choppy and uneven. even his sideburns were cut at two very different lengths. called the store to see if i could bring him back the next day but in the end decided to go to the location where he regularly goes.
"so i was in desperate need of a haircut. i called as soon as they opened & this angel beth m answered immediately. she said ""come on in. i will fit you in and i will fix your hair."" i went in looking & feeling down. but beth m fixed my hair & beard into a new style that i never tried before and it turned out amazing! i walk around with this new style looking great with my head held high now. thanks to beth m, i am alittle more happy and confident about my appearance. thanks so much beth m at supercuts."
"i've been here 3 times. twice as a walk-in, waited 50 minutes b fore giving up and leaving. finally made an appointment the third time and still waited 45 minutes. this place is just totally understaffed. advertises as a place with quick service, but doesn't deliver"
"such an awesome location with a bunch of talented and very friendly stylists! i love how convenient it is, especially since they do color and waxing in addition to haircuts. just what the neighborhood needed!!"
really great service here. friendly and talented staff.  you may have a wait...but after all they are  a walk in salon. these ladies work extremely hard to get the job done !!
"recently increased their prices to 20 dollars, and they try to rush you out of there without a proper cut. didn't get what i asked for either, and the lady said that she had cut hair for 15 years. mentioned that i wanted a part and said that she couldn't because i had too much hair in the way. no longer a cheap haircut so i'd pay the extra 10-15 and go to an actual barber shop or salon."
kaylee did a great job love the new hair cut! this is my second hair cut at this location they do a great job!
ivana was wonderful and got everything exactly how i want it. great job. would highly recommend!
had a great appointment today with tori. my son had a very specific idea of how he wanted his hair done and she was the best at working with his needs. for sure coming back to this location in the future!
great experience!  tori was super friendly!  i would recommend coming in.  make sure to check in on line.
tori was super friendly and kind! she was very helpful with information on how to keep my hair healthy with the products recommended.
"the stylist shall remain nameless since she never bothered to tell me her name even after i asked if her name was ""____"" she said no,  and never said what it was.  i felt like we were uninvited guests to the employee's party"
"first let me say that the only reason i gave this place 2 stars was because a former stylist named joey was fabulous.  he cut my hair twice and was superb. i've been back 2 more times since joey left.  2nd visit....waited 45 minutes.  this was after my online check in time. i saw jackie.  meh.  a flat tire has more personality.  i give the cut an 8. she didn't smile, didn't ask me anything.  jackie shouldn't be in the retail business if she's not a people person.3rd time- i checked in online for an 11:20 appt with michelle, the manager.  got there at 11:10.  it'll be 20 minutes.  fine. no problem.she's talking about herself to the customer.talking to another stylist about hiring another stylist.asking if this other stylist tick tock tick tock tick tock            tick tock tick tock.one hour latershe's sweeping the floortaking tape out of the registertakes something out of her purse and goes into the bathroom.10 minutes more! i'm not sure what the reason is for checking in on-line if we're just going to sit there for an hour anyway.  i sat there for an hour on purpose, waiting to see if at least one person said anything to me as i was the only one there.nobody said anything.i left.not a phone call (you have to check in with a phone number)  i'm going back to my ""real"" salon where they care about their customers."
"the stylist was nice and haircut is fine but unfortunately i left with a bad taste in my mouth. apparently the owners do not allow coupons that aren't printed. which is so silly. i register my email address today, downloaded the app so that i could check in and save time. i received an email with a $2 off coupon. i checked in on the app, arrived. waited 30 minutes.... got my haircut and then tried to use my coupon only to be told it had to be printed to be accepted. i think that is rediculous. we are in a digital world. it should say on the coupon that it must be printed to be honored. it's too bad that the owners make up a bogus policy and require the stylist enforce it. this makes the final minutes of the transaction unpleasant which could effect the amount of a tip (i still tipped appropriately). it did definitely confirm the fact that i won't be returning to this location."
absolutely amazing service!!got my eyebrows done by joey and my hair cut by casey. they both did an amazing job i'm so pleased! the salon is very clean and the staff is friendly. i will be a regular from now on.thanks guys!!
"garbage place, went in for a haircut on sunday and was trying to get a faux hawk. they ended up buzzing the top side of my head than continued to just straight buzz cut it as i couldn't change it from there. my girlfriend and i were very specific on what we wanted done and they spent maybe 3mins on my girlfriend and i. did a terrible job and no manager has bothered to look into this and the owner doesn't take responsibility for their employees. on top of that they cut my girlfriends hair in different lengths and now has to get it cut shorter and she didn't want to do so cause of her 21st birthday.  $40 spent on top of $30 for a hat to cover up the buzz cut. already spoke with a lawyer about this horrible situation and mental stress they have caused my girlfriend and i along with ruining her hair plans for her 21st birthday. don't ever go here as the owner or managers make no attempt in providing good customer service. i will be going forward in suing this location for their actions."
"bad! i have been using this salon since they opened. its close to where i live so its convenient. over the last 6 months i have been going when they open@8 on saturdays as it works best for me and each time i feel like i am an inconvenience its the same stylist ""jackie"" this last time was the end all for me with the salon not only did she open the salon late (as usual) she didnt say one word to me other than ""how do u want it cut"" no good morning nothing  she then did one quick swoop around my hair pulled off my cape and said ok ur done never even asked if it was ok if i needed anything else etc. although i was disappointed i still left my normal 5.00 tip but won't be back. i will drive out of my way for better customer service."
"went in for an overdue cut today. it's nice to have a location closer to home.the wait was pleasant and i was taken care of very quickly. what i also really like about this salon is that they are a full service salon, they provide waxing services and at very reasonable prices. the stylist was engaging, fun to chat with and she listened carefully to my needs and wishes and did an outstanding job. i will stick with this location from now on."
"i made an appointment with michael today base on several good reviews and i am very happy i did.  he did a great job of highlighting, lowlighting and cutting my hair.  i am extremely pleased and he was also very pleasant.  i highly recommend him!  i plan to be a regular customer."
this is the only place (including high dollar salons) that can cut my long thick hair. most places attempt to cut it in two different chunks but then they can never get it blended. i always end up back at supercuts if an attempt at another salon is ventured.
"i had a color, cut and style.  i was overjoyed with the out come.  the staff was amazing the salon was clean and i have nothing but positive thoughts and comments to say about the salon. thank you michael for great hairdo.!!!!!"
i went in for a hair cut and shampoo. michael did a very good job on my haircut. along with my eye brow waxing. this supercuts location is very clean and embraces a positive work environment. keep up the hard work!
"not so super of an experience. will never go back. my husband and son needed haircuts so we decided to try this place out instead of where we normally go as i thought it would be ok. we waited almost an hour (not a surprise because there was a lot of people waiting but we thought we will see how it goes) only to become #1 and 2 on the list (yay we are next!) and they call the people who are #4, 5, and 6! we had been waiting longer then the people they called, we saw them check in so it wasn't an online check in and it clearly showed they were after us on the list! we were so angry we left and will never go back. the people who work there didn't even notice that after sitting almost an hour we were getting up and leaving. this was about an hour ago. we will go next week to our normal place (sport clips) where it may cost more but we aren't invisible. we didn't throw a fit (wanted to!) because i didn't want to make the people they called feel bad as it wasn't their fault. so no, i do not recommend this place. would give zero stars if it were possible."
"britney is an incredibly talented and confident stylist. i've been coming here for couple of months. from shampooing, the haircut itsel all the way to product recommendations, she has steered me in the right direction each and every time. there are other supercuts that are closer to my home in gilbert, but i am so happy to drive a few extra miles for the privilege of working with her."
super disappointed with my sons hair cut from yesterday (3/31/16). my husband took our son in for a hair cut and he came home with something that looked like i did it in our kitchen. his hairline in the back was so bad i can't even begin to describe it. his sideburns are very uneven and so is his front hair line. i have to take him to another place today to have it fixed. i would never recommend going to this location. i would give them zero stars if i could.
every time i try to go to this location they have an excuse as to why they can't take me. the whole idea of supercuts is the convenience of no appointment necessary. however even after i check in on line they turn me away. i think the people who work there just don't want to do color. if it was just one time i would say no big deal but this is the 4th time in the last year that they have turned me away for a simple root touch up of brown hair. i will never go back to this location again. tgey have horrible customer service and they obviously do not want my business.
best experience ever toni took care of me cut my hair really good i would say come here had me in and out 10 minutes
"i don't usually go to supercuts, but, i work next door. toni is awesome!  i needed a new do and she talked with me and gave me just what we had decided. then i went back yesterday and wanted something new again.  she gave me another great cut! thanx girl."
"outstanding haircut by rocky! she talks you through what she is going to do and makes you feel comfortable in the chair. i was impressed by her skill and her accuracy of the haircut. i will definitely be returning to this young, hip gal."
first time coming to super cuts. wih that said let me add i'm big on not ever going anywhere to get my hair cut. one bad time did it for me. however i was having issues with my scam and an excellent recomendation to get the lavender tea tree shampoo and conditioner helped. as i'm getting a scalp massag and wash hot towels were a plus for the face. made my over all experience pleasurable. on to the hair cut. sarah f cut my hair and did and excellent job as i told her what i liked and didnt like. she put hope back in my heart for being able to get my hair cut again!!! keep it up!! i might be a regular.
very friendly and fun conversations to be had over here. the store manager toni is very knowledgeable and passionate about what she does. it's good to be able to go someplace where i know i can get a quality service done fast and for a great price. just passing through the area and needed a quick touchup before i went back to san diego and got just what i was looking for. love people with great customer service skills and always want them to feel recognized and appreciated. thanks again.
"i'm on vacation visiting friends and needed a trim. the stylist, toni was upbeat, welcoming and professional. i was very happy with my haircut and the service!"
i took my granddaughter for a trim.  saw a lady leaving with a super cute short cut. i needed a cut and asked who cut her hair.  she said toni so i had my hair cut after my granddaughter's trim.  toni did the best cut i have had in a year. i hope she never leaves chandler.  she is awesome.
toni is amazing with color! she did an all over low light and highlight color on me and it was spot on! she's got an amazing eye for what you ask for! she's also fun and friendly!
"i come in evey couple of months. on my last visit i was very happy with the service. almost never a long wait. the manager of the salon heidi, did an absolutely amazing job. i had a haircut and brow wax. one of the best brow jobs i have ever had. the cut was great too. she took the time to explain what cut would work best for my face. all of the stylists are super friendly. would deffinatly  recommend this location."
i was extremely satisfied with my hair cut.  heidi was genuinely concerned with making sure i got exactly what i wanted.  she took exceptional time and care with me. i was in town visiting from new york and making this quick stop was a risk.  i am so happy i found heidi.
"toni is a great stylist. she is very professional and is excellent at both cut and color. i have trusted her with my hair many, many times. she's also done wonders with my eyebrows, so get a wax while you're there! i would recommend toni to anyone."
"extremely pleased with my cut and color-- toni listened to me describe my ""hair concerns"" and she magically fixed it all.   i am from out of town, so was not sure where to go.   i recommend supercuts...good clean salon, reasonable prices and talented stylists.  don't hesitate to try.....they are great!"
toni is amazing!! she's worked wonders on my hair! :) she always makes sure i leave absolutely satisfied! she listens to what you want and pays attention to detail! and her skills with color are phenominal!! i would recommend her to anyone! :)
i love going to this location for my haircuts. veronica knows exactly what she is doing and always makes sure i am 100% happy with my hair. i don't know a lot about hairstyles so i let her do what she thinks will look good. she always gives me a slightly new look and i'm always satisfied with it. the stylists always genuinely greet me right when i walk in the door. there a plenty of supercuts closer to my home but i'd rather make the trip and know i'll be happy with the results.
"i've been a client at this supercuts for eight years. no longer.  i've received two haircuts in that entire time i wasn't happy with (both this past year).  recently, a cut left my hair butchered. i told my brother's gf i look like a homeless rag doll.  i asked the gal that cut it if she could fix it and she said i had to get back in the store within the same week.  an appliance emergency at home and my work schedule, made it impossible to get in within that time period (it had to match her work schedule she said) leaving me with this awful haircut. i expressed my sadness on fb because i cried every morning that week when i looked in the mirror at my hair.  the stylist text me saying she'd never touch my hair again and to basically f off. i don't deserve nasty text messages.  that's not ok. very disrespectful."
"stylist was young and fairly inexperienced. she also took way too long and i had to point out on multiple occasions when she was ""done"" that hair length was uneven in certain areas.this place is hit or miss when it comes to quality."
"the wife scheduled our 2 young kids for haircuts via their website.  she shows up on time and is told website scheduling isn't working and that she'll need to wait 30-45 minutes.  wife asks for a discount and is told they'll need to call a district mgr to approve that and that will cause them to have to stop cutting peoples' hair ... which then caused customers to turn on my wife and start saying nasty things to her in front of our kids.  terrible, terrible, terrible.  we had been frequent customers at that location ... but no more!"
lame... got here at 6:30 and was told they stop taking haircuts at 6:30 but close at 7... what ever... the older lady there looked like she hates her job... i guess that's what you get at one of these cheap places... crappy customer service...
it's great. it's a normal supercuts experience and i got a quick solid haircut. i don't know why everyone else is complaining about this store - it's not any different than other supercuts. i'd go back (i've been about 5 times).
"yeah, idk what's going on with the stylists at this location. there was one girl that worked there that was really good and i haven't seen her in months. i guess she quit and went to a sports clips. any time supercuts gets a good employee they wind up quitting and going somewhere else. it's so sad. anyway, the last 2 haircuts i got here were pure crap...i mean, they were uneven and weren't even what i asked for. granted, my hair is a little difficult since it grown in like 50 different directions...it doesn't seem like the stylists care or really analyze someone's hair before they start chopping at it. it seems like supercuts must be a terrible company to work for since employees keep quitting and the ones that do work there seem like they don't care. i'm sure there's real talent currently employed there but doesn't seem like the company is tapping into that talent. i'm definitely going to try a different place. ya know, for just a few $$ more you can go to a full service salon."
"despite the bad reviews, i went here for a bang trim. i figured you cant ruin a bang trim, right? wrong. i got in my car and straightened out my bangs and there were long pieces everywhere. i thought to myself, is 7 dollars worth it to let this lady hack my hair some more? nope. so i went home and fixed them myself... listen to the bad reviews and take your money elsewhere"
"i went in today to get a haircut and was told, supercuts was not going to give courteous neck trims, that it would cost the same price as a haircut???? really? how do you compare a 25 minute haircut to a 3 minute neck trim??? at the same price??? either they go back to courteous free neck trims or lose many male customers, me included. on a positive note, shantie and lana are always great at giving haircuts, i have been going there for 6 plus years now."
"i went to this location with my dad on 27th sep, 2015 and it turned out to be an ugly experience!! i'm definitely not going back ever again and will make it a point to spread the word to people i know who live in the area. there were two girls working at that time and one of them that was going to give me a haircut was super rude and downright racist! her behavior seemed to stem from the fact that 1) i walked in late (although i had told her in the beginning that i could come back next day if it was too late) and 2) that i'm an indian (and she did not want to deal with even a bit of accent or non american names). it was such a display of unprofessionalism and disrespect for the customer!! i got up and told her that i did not want a haircut from her! the other girl (with a distinct tattoo on her arm) was very embarrassed by her colleague's behavior and in fact asked her to leave right away. unfortunately all of this unfolded in front of my dad who is visiting from india for few days and i'm sad that he'll leave with the wrong impression of an otherwise superb city."
"unless you get mallory, don't other. so i called at 9ish and made an appointment for 11. i got there around 10 to and when i walked in heather was cutting someone else's hair and didn't even look over just said, ""did you call before you came in?"" and i said yes, i have an 11 o'clock appointment. she said nothing more. that should have been my first hint. at 11 she calls me back. i showed her a pic of what i wanted and told her i wanted about an inch off so it comes to the bottom of my neck and she took me back and washed my hair and sat me down. when she began to cut she segmented the front off and brushed the back down and boom cut straight across and took off 2-3 inches  (well above the bottom of my neck) i wanted the front angled and i even stopped her at one point because she just grabbed a chunk and went to snip n i said wait wait wait that's a lot and she says oh i'm gonna go down. (no idea what that meant) anyways so 10 minutes later my hair is done and i look in the mirror and i'm immediately like no no no this is way too short n she says well i told you you wouldn't be able to pull it back  don't know what the hell that was supposed to mean. then she says you're done. i ask her for a mirror to look at the back (thank god) and it wasn't even even and there were chunks of stray hair and i told her about it and she said ""well that's because it's rolled under""  what the fu** does that even mean?! i said yea well when it's straight it's gonna look even more fu**ed up! she kept arguing with me to get back in the chair so she can fix it and i'm like you will not touch my hair! my dogs could have cut my hair better than this person. thankfully mallory, the manager, was standing right there and shooed her away and did the best she could to fix it... too bad it's basically irreparable. mallory was wonderful and did what she could but heather messed up my hair so bad you would swear she's never cut hair before. i personally think she botched my hair intentionally for some reason seeing as she seemed to be in a bitter mood as soon as i walked in the door. probably feigning for a cigarette, as soon as mallory told her to go that's right where she went, sorry to impose on you heather!  and thanks for fu**ing up my hair."
"hit or miss here, depends on who you ""get."" but, there's one stylist there who doers a meticulous, thorough job, so i keep coming back. it's about 5 minutes away from my house as well, so that's a huge bonus. always a good idea to call ahead... who likes waiting for a half-hour plus-some for a trim? i don't. place is clean and pleasant, i usually have a coupon too for the $10.99 hair cut. what a deal."
i love bringing my 5 year old here. getting his haircut is always torture but the girls here are always amazing with him!! great staff and clean all around!!
"went in yesterday for a trim... specifically told the person cutting my hair i wanted a trim and showed her exactly how much i wanted taken off. i even joked they do not need to be paid for quantity, but quality. i walked out a few inches taken off my hair and instead of a trim got a full blown boy hair cut. i specifically told her several times not too short and even discussed a new shampoo i had that seemed to be making my hair grow really fast. upon finishing, i replied how short it was.... i guess my definition of a tiny, tiny bit off of the bangs and hers were two different things. then she replied guess it lucky you got the shampoo that makes your hair grow faster.  why is it there are no stylists that can cut a woman's short hair without practically shaving their head and making them look like a dude.... oh and the gouges and uneven parts are the icing on the cake....  also, she cut my hair so fast she kept slapping me in the face with her comb....."
this is the worst hair cutting shit hole i've ever been to! the stylist and front desk lady were rude and seemed rushed because they didn't want to help out a customer or cut someone's hair. my hair cut was uneven and way shorter than what i asked for not to mention they can never line up my side burns evenly like how hard is it?! i could probably cut my own hair better than any of these rude nasty stylist in definitely never going here again! i'd rather pay more money for better service and quality work!
first time i had lisa cut and  my hairi brought in a picture of what i wantedi also asked her opinion.my cut was perfect !very happy with the end results will definately be back.thanks lisa
"thought i'd impulsively get a haircut. the place was quiet, and i decided not to be off-put by the stylist who checked me in being rude.so while he was clipping a customer ahead of me, 3 stylists finished their cuts and then got very very very very very very involved with getting their equipment absolutely spotless. when i looked inquiringly in their direction, they glared & turned away. all i'd done was sit quietly with a magazine!once it became clear that my only option would be the stylist who'd already decided he couldn't understand my speech, i thanked the shop politely and left.if i looked like crap, it's because i needed a haircut! i guess i should figure i dodged a bullet, as who knows what this rude shop would have decided it was okay to do to my hair."
went in for a haircut tonight and the service was horrible. i got there and was never acknowledged. i waited for about an hour and watched 3 customers get waited on before i did. this service was ridiculous and i will not be coming back to this location. i have never had a problem with any other supercuts location.
"i have to say that i love coming to this place whenever i need to freshen up. big thank you to andy nguyen, friendly, professional, and genuine. you will be able to learn about andys life or day as he is cutting your hair. he cares about his clients and will ask you how your doing and how life is going for you lately. he will always bring a smile to your face and the place is also located next to amazing breakfast and lunch options. all around appreciate andy and super cuts at this location, there is no need for me to go anywhere else! -sammy the luxury expert @ chapman bmw camelback"
"i went in just to get my sides faded. the gentleman cutting my hair was being pretty rough (i should have said something) but i also know that i can be tender headed so i tried to ignore it. when i left, i paid and tipped him; i didn't get a receipt but didn't think too much about asking for one. by the time i got home, my head was burning in multiple spots. i looked into the mirror to find multiple areas of irritation and that he had cut me along almost the entire length of my neckline. since i don't have a receipt there's not much i can do. but i will not be back, it really sucks when a service that is supposed to help you feel good ends up doing the exact opposite!"
first time i had andy cut and color my hairi brought in a picture of what i wantedi also asked his opinion as to colormy cut and color was perfect !very happy with the end results will definately be back
lisa cut my hair. i asked as short as you can and she delivered. very happy with my even and clean hair cut. great location.
"this is not your average supercuts. it's a very nice, upscale location and everyone here is so nice. i've been going for the past 5 years or so, to see andy. he is insanely good and has an amazing following (book ahead). if andy is on vacation i'll see lisa, as she has also been here for many years and her customers rave about her as well. use their app or call in to book ahead so that you don't have a long wait. it's worth it, and you too will come to love this little gem. thanks andy for many years of friendship and making my mess of hair look great!"
"i was looking for an affordable, clean location for a haircut-i chose this supercuts mostly because it's near where i live. i was pleasantly surprised by the expert service i received from lisa, a stylist here. my only surprise came from the fact that their prices are on par with the fancier salons in the area. a good experience overall. lisa is great at her craft."
"i'm new to the area and read some reviews of this location before i went. some good and some bad but enough good ones for me to give it a try. i walked in right behind another customer so there was two of us in line. the gentleman who came over to the counter to check us in took the customer in front of me telling him ""you have two people in front of you it will be 20mins."" i walked up next and he said to me ""you will wait 1 hour, there's 3-4 people ahead of you"". i have no problem waiting i'm a patient person. but when you come off rude towards me when i watched you be polite to the person in front of me, that's when i get irritated. and you add a range # of people ahead of me when you tell the person in front of me something different. i understand the feeling of being busy and overwhelmed but don't take it out on a customer that walked in for a service (what your at super cuts to do). i walked out, not worth the wait if he was rude to me the second i walked in, can't imagine how the rest of the service would have gone."
"thank you libby, for giving me the haircut of my dreams. i wish i could put something on my head to keep my hair from growing so i would always look this good! i like this salon overall, but the talent has varied somewhat, which is why i can't give it five stars. but i'll keep coming back because i like the friendly service, reasonable prices, and accessible location."
"went to supercuts this week for a haircut and shampoo. libby id a fabulous job with the cut! it looks wonderful! and she is one of the few hair stylists that did not cut off more than i asked her to. i don't know about the other stylists here, but libby is the best!-norma"
andy has been cutting my hair at this location for 5+ years. he's consistently great and my go to hair stylist. super cuts is lucky to have andy
libby was great was honest about my color she could of easily said yes do the whole thing! but she didn't. i will fer sure have her do my color again!! very sweet person. as for the bad reviews have you ever heard you get what you put out!! maybe you get bad service because your an a**.  we all can be one i know when i'm a jerk to someone they will be a jerk back! it's human nature. try being  nice to each other you will be amazed what you get in return.
"i don't expect to be wow'd by a haircut from supercuts, but i at least expect the cut to be symmetrical! i asked for a trim and then some light layers with long bangs (chin-length). the trim alone took nearly 30 minutes as it seemed she was counting each individual strand on my head. you'd expect with such attention to detail that both sides of my head would at least be symmetical but she cut more ""bangs"" on one side of my head than the other in a completely botched attempt at layers. definitely not interested in ever returning."
libby is excellent! she repaired a botched hair color done at a nearby pricey salon! she's awesome!
"i like coming to get my haircut here. not sure what happened with the rest of these reviews, but i am always pleased with the service and price point of this supercuts! will continue to give them my business!"
"i have cut my hair twice here and before everything was perfect the girls were very nice very polite and patient but on this occasion vicky the stylist got really upset because i used my phone had a emergency call so she didn't finish the job appropriately, she rushed through it, she didn't even clean up with a warm towel like they always do. when i brought it up she argued with me saying that i was rude and that customers are not always right. i never got on her way of cutting my hair i just didn't talk to her while she was working on my hair cut and is my thought she took  it personal."
this location for supercuts is not the best experience i had.  the stylist that shaved my head was not knowledge and was too afraid to use the hair clippers to shave down to stubbles.  he was not that great but friendly and nice guy.  i would hope they can shape things up to have better stylists and knowledgeable.
"when one kid wanted a short and spiky haircut and the other wants to keep it longer like justin bieber, i realized that going to my regular barber might not be the best move, so we checked out supercuts. even walking in without an appointment they were able to get both boys in the chairs within 10 minutes and we were out of there in half an hour. both of the boys came out looking great and they were both very happy with the haircuts they received. i would definitely recommend this location, especially if you have kids who need haircuts."
i've been here several times and am mostly happy with my experience here.  wait times are generally very reasonable and the ability to check in ahead of time is a massive convenience added in the past few years.
"ask for landree and you'll get a 4-star haircut i guarantee. he is the most knowledgeable person there and can even give you tips and tricks on how to maintain, style and keep your hair looking good always.make sure to tell him how you want your haircut and he'll make sure you get what you want."
nice job... my bad.. didn't get her name. she has done hair now for a little over a year. young and dark brown hair. anyway i gave her specific instructions and she followed them to a t! will definitely come back here next time in town.
never had an issue with a hair stylist before but paula r. treated me like i was the last person on earth she wanted to be providing a service to. attitude not fit for customer service and not very helpful. will not be back to see her.
"olga is the best if not for her there would not be super in supercuts, she has attention to detail and makes me look like a movie star."
"just got me and my daughter's hair cut and the lady did a horrible job. i told her to cut my daughter's all one length yet it all ended up longer in the back. mine ended up sorter on one side with tons of little hairs all over my clothes when she took the apron off me and continued to cut more. she just had a very, ""i don't care"" attitude and now after spending $35 i get to go home and cut my daughter's hair again and try to fix my own. never coming here again!"
"you gotta go see landree! he is the best hair stylist/barber i have ever been to. this guy is the real deal, seriously! have you ever felt like a million bucks because of a haircut? i have. do you know why???? because of landree. he should travel the country to teach other hair stylists how to cut hair. the man is basically a magician with hair. it's unbelievable. i hope he never retires. that's how incredible he is. he's the whole enchilada. he's the bees' knees."
"i had no idea how to explain what i wanted when i walked in, but within a few minutes of talking to the lady, she knew exactly what i wanted with a jumbled words i was trying. very fun to talk to, unfortunately didn't get her name. 10/10 would recommend."
"very professional lady she did a great fade after i screwed up the back of my head, and the gentlemen that work there was very nice and helpful, the store is clean and they have a great selection of product, definitely recommend this place"
such friendly staff.  fast and grateful to talk to.  this was my first time and i will be back!
"this supercuts is a great place to get a haircut! landree and the other stylists are always friendly and professional. they are easy to talk to, they listen to your needs, and they don't use aggressive sales tactics to get you to buy expensive shampoo! i recommend this salon to anyone looking for a good haircut at a reasonable price!"
well since my last review was removed very unprofessional!! i got my hair colored and highlighted and was told by the stylist if i was unable happy to come back. i came back in 4 days to have more highlights put in front and she recharges me..so color and highlights cost 85 +45=130 and im still not happy...i'll never be back!! take an honest review down shame on u....
"went in in this evening . the lady cutting my hair either had a plane to catch or was genuinely not interested. didn't even let me say a word on what was wrong with the haircut , took the cover off and went and stood at the cash register . maybe it was just a coincidence or an example of absolutely unsatisfactory service . i don't care much , just that i have to spend another 20 to get a haircut the way i want but this time wont repeat this mistake ."
"just went in for a quick trim.  waited a couple of minutes for a stylist to be available, but it was early and they had only been open for about 30 minutes when i got there.  i was greeted right when i walked in and they let me know it would be a couple of minutes - so i was fine waiting.my hair stylist was very friendly and did exactly what i wanted her to do with just trimming off the bottom ends of my hair so that i can grow out the layers i once decided were a good idea.overall: agood for a quick trim and service was friendly!"
"desperate for a haircut i came in about an hour before closing- i double checked to make sure this wasn't too late for me to get a trim and my layers cut. i was told ""a haircut is a haircut"". that's reassuring, good to know you don't think haircuts differ at all in time. this woman with short red hair(pixie cut) came over and showed me to to my seat- her breath reeked of cigarettes. i told her i wanted to keep my length- light layers- and a frontal bang. she did the worst haircut i have ever received in my life- and this is not an exaggeration. my hair went from the middle of my right below my collar bone. that's not layering that's doing a sh*tty cut because you want to go home. and i am particularly attached to my hair/ it takes a while for it to grow. i started crying in the chair and my hair fell to the floor. she looked at me and rudely asked if i had ever had layers before as if i was stupid. i told her i'd had em all my life but they never looked like this. she kept none of the length. and her complete lack of compassion and customer service at the fact that i was obviously upset. she held no conversation- asked how my day was or anything. a girls hair is very important and now i have to spend the next few months wearing a ponytail. i will never be back & i wish the store owner was there so they could see that directly."
"start: 11:04 : opens door, walks in.11:05 : seated , introductions, hair cut starts 11:09 : paid, walking out door ! effin a ! this is the in & out of hair cut joints ! do i like my cut - yes. is it fancy schmancy ? nope, its just a regular guys hair cut! short, clean and simple.total time saved compared to joya spa - 1 hr, money saved - 50 $ ! totally worth it, going back next month ! woot woot ! more money to buy things i dont really need!"
"disappointed with the service i received from carrie today. she was unwelcoming and displayed a ""cold"" attitude towards me and her own co workers. bad representation of the company. i won't be returning."
"walked in, received horrible service so, walked out. what nasty looking stylists. i'll never return. try zara salon next door. i see donna now."
"i gave one star bc i had to. i have never in my life been to such an unprofessional place in my life.  i'll spare the name of my ""stylist"" but why, idk. bottom line is, if you can't cut hair right, don't cut someones hair!!  i'll stick to letting the professionals at honeycomb organic hair salon  do my cutting from now on. how hard could it possibly be to trim bangs?! they're already parted shaped! my bangs look disgusting and i'm not going to let that hack job try to fix them. bs!"
"pleasant staff, no real wait time, and conveniently located close to home.  while i fully admit to being high maintenance in some ways i keep my hair a relatively simple process - just follow what is there, keep it even, and charge me less than $20 because whatever is left from president jackson is your tip.  one star off for forcing me to listen to pop music for 20 minutes, but otherwise not too shabby at all."
cain was amazing. my regular hair person is out on maternity leave so i decided to come give this place a try. cain knew exactly what to do based on the other person's instructions and gave me a perfect haircut.  very professional place and the price is great.
"so i really can't explain how amazing my hair cut was that i just got yesterday. i paid 16$ for a regular hair cut and walked out with something worth at least 100$. go to the cute, thin bleach blonde guy with fringe hair cut and some tattoos (i cant remember his name im so sad). edit: found his name, cain. go to cain!!! i'm seriously not joking this is the best hair cut i've ever gotten. it is a long bob with layers and i feel like selena gomez. seriously, i'm obsessed and i would go back here just to see him every time but i was only in town for the weekend and my friend and i decided to do something crazy with our hair (chop it off). best haircut of my life. i will re-comment on this once i get his name from calling when they open. but if you are reading this, you are amazing and you need to be working in the best salon in scottsdale."
fantastic haircut from cain. he always does a great job. everyone was very nice and friendly. very helpful to select appropriate style and products.
"absolutely ecstatic with my cut, color and highlights! i haven't allowed anyone to touch my hair in 20 years! amari came highly recommended, so i took a chance (you can imagine what my hair looked like after so long without professional attention)!  she did an amazing job! she was very very knowledgeable on all the latest techniques, and suggested all the right products for long term use. love the cut! love the color! and it feels great too! she has a client for life !!!!"
"totally awesome haircut by gavin!   he also made very helpful recommendations for hair products for both my son and i.  gavin is professional and cool.  my sons hair isn't easy to cut, as it's curly with lots of calic - he took his time and gave him best cut of his 6 yr old life.    we will be back to see these guys again!"
"called ahead to put my name down,  they quoted the time, the stylist was awesome,  i totally forgot her name, but she has an owl tattoo!  so there,  now you can find her!seriously though,  she listened,  had great suggestions for my thick curly hair. my next visit will be color! i love my haircut!"
hey everyone thank you so much for the reviews. keep them coming. :). and just as a reminder if you'd like a career with supercuts. please apply atwww.supercuts.com
"guided here to gavin through the divine magic of yelp, i wasn't disappointed. gavin got me in right away for a trim on my bleached-to-death white hair. he asked me about how i wear and style my hair, adding a few touches to the overall shape to make things easier in the mornings. while i was adamant about visiting gavin for my first visit to supercuts, i'd definitely work with any of the other stylists i met in the future. this was my first haircut under $80, and i won't ever be priced-gouged like that again!"
"gavin is a rockstar, after three cuts he had it down and all i do is sit and he goes to work. good guy to small talk with too. 6 stars from me"
"i hate getting my hair cut...i was pleasantly surprised, that i made a check in and was put in a chair right away.  gavin took the picture i had and made it look just like it but still left a little wiggle room just in case i really didn't want to cut too much :)  well, after starting to go to the gym and summer coming on i really needed more cut and andrea did rest i love this place!  i have had non-stop compliments on my hair."
"i've tried toni & guy twice over the last 5 years, otherwise had a friend cut my hair. it was time to get a professional cut again and i figured i'd try supercuts in my neighborhood.i had no prior experience with supercuts but would have expected from hair salons in the past:- that they'd wash my hair before cutting, not use a water spray bottle- that it takes more than 10 minutes to cut and trim hair that hadn't been cut in 6 months.- that they'd offer a mirror to see the back when asking if it looked ok.- that they'd dry my hair!!!!i left the store with my hair wet and combed back. no idea what i'd look like.when i got home and dried it, the left ear had a strand of hair an inch longer than the right.the back wasn't layered and all kinds of uneven hairs were flipping and sticking out.wound up taking scissors and ""fixing"" it myself.while friendly and inexpensive, i would not use them again."
"i went into supercuts after 2 years of not cutting my hair because i had a very short pixie cut and the stylist that cut my hair made me go home crying. i don't if she's new, but she asked another stylist andrea how to cut my bangs (side swept with some pieces falling to the front) and she disregarded what her superior told her and in result left me looking like a porcupine because the bangs were beyond short. when i questioned it, she just used my hair needing to be trained as an excuse. although that was true, there's no way could train the baby hairs she made. not only did she totally ignore that i wanted some pieces created in the front but she cut my length twice as short as what i told her to. my hair was below my bottom and now it's barely below my shoulders. she even asked me twice and i had told her multiple times before i actually sat down, so i was confused as to why it was so short. the only other explanation was that she had probably messed up. she left the layers i asked for looking like really badly places extensions and not natural looking at all. i'm going to have to wear my hair up in a pony tail for the rest of the year. after she was done i was hoping someone else would do my waxing, but that wasn't the case. so after not saying anything about the hair because after all it is hair and it grows back, i was completely done when she spilled wax in my eye. she just said, ""oops haha, it just fell right off"" not even getting a real apology. so after being there for almost 2 hours, without the store not being busy, i wasn't impressed. my husband cuts his hair there all the time and they do an awesome job, so for that i won't give them a one star. i guess it's just that one employee, so if you ever get a stylist with pink and blonde hair, glasses, and smells like smoke, be sure to request someone else unless you want bad service or want to end up looking like edward scissorhands gave you a haircut."
"i called in ahead of time for roxy.  gavin answered my call & told me roxy was busy at the moment; but would be available within the hour.  i arrived almost to the hour; i was greeted by roxy, i only waited about 5 minutes.  roxy, took her time discussing my haircut & color and made suggestions.  my cut & color came out awesome.  i feel really comfortable with her.  gavin is awesome too!  they both really enjoy making you feel at home; which means a lot to me."
"i found this location near my house using yelp, and was impressed by it's great reviews. i don't usually use supercuts for myself but decided to try it as i needed a quick haircut before leaving on vacation. i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of haircut and service i received! i had andrea and she was efficient, courteous, and did a great job with my long hair. i'm pretty particular about keeping my length but she offered great advice and guided me in right direction for a simple but great cut. i'm very happy with the results and will be returning again!"
"....my hair looks fine, but i swear to god the young lady cutting it was intentionally jabbing me with the sheers."
"stopped in for a haircut and color. the staff is very nice and the girl that cut, colored and styled my hair did an awesome job. they are just as good here as a salon you might pay twice as much at. so glad i stopped in."
"stopped in today for a quick trim between running errands. amanda did a fabulous job on my pixie cut and i appreciated her positive, upbeat service.  overall, a good salon for a quick, inexpensive cut for only $15."
"the staff here is great very friendly and always greeted with a hi & smile! i get my brows done by jessica she is the master of brows! the salon is clean and professional,wait time is good not too long.they carry a variety of hair products from paul mitchell,redken,matrix,tigi,etc. go in and see them for a great hair cut,color and waxing!!!!"
"nothing to rave about, but certainly worth the money they were charging. they are often busy, which means i have to wait up to an hour to get my hair cut."
"i love my new hair, new color. kalimah was the only one working when my mom and i came in. she did an awesome job for both of us. we will definitely come back!!!"
"outstanding and friendly service!i have been to this location twice now and this is now my spot for trimming up the old mop on my head... my first time in i had the really small mexican girl who doesn't talk a lot but is literally the most amazing person i have ever witnessed cutting hair with mostly all scissors in my life! she is so fast and accurate it is something to see! i don't recall her name, but she has skills and was polite! this week i returned for round two and the other girl wasn't there. so i tried a new girl who was also great. i of course don't remember her name either but her mother is from jamaica and she is super friendly. she did a great job on my hair as well. all in all my 2 trips in here were outstanding!"
"i came in probably about 1:30p on friday. i seen two stylists with clients however i was greeted right away by savannah as i waddled (7 months expecting) to the computer to be checked in. i must mention that no one has touched my hair in years! color and cut. my hair ran down my back and when i came in i was determined to go really short! so i was really nervous when i just decided to come in after work and get my wavy locks cut. savannah was extremely friendly while checking me in. asked for my name and phone number and what services i will be needing. i explained i was nervous due to the request of what cut i was wanting, a long bob. but assured me i will be taken care of shortly.the other stylist finished rather quickly, walked with her client to the front and checked him out then began her duties of cleaning. savannah didn't take long to finish with her client then i was next..savannah was very knowledgeable and gave me great detail as to what she would be doing before we began. she kept up a great conversation and offered the blow dry service so i can see the finish outcome and how it can be styled. this store was very clean, stylists were professional and it was great pricing."
"first time ever trying supercuts. i was so excited because they stay open till 6 pm on sunday. i drove 9 miles to get there and arrive 10 minutes before closing. the sign in the window says ""open"". a lady name natalie said they have two customers ahead of me and they can't except me. i don't think i'll ever be back to supercuts, very disappointed. not used to a business that turns away customers during the hours they show they are still open."
"my experience here is a joke. i was super early for a movie so i stopped by to get a haircut. i was greeted immediately by vivian who took me back after getting all my info, and she asked me what i wanted. i told her i wanted a trim and layers, because i've been growing out my hair and i've been pretty bored with it. she asked me where i wanted the shortest layer and i said i wasn't sure, and asked what she thought. her response was, ""it's up to you."" well....yes, i know that, but what kind of stylist can't even give professional opinions, especially when asked? she took scissors and cut an inch off my hair, used the same scissors to do one swipe down the hair on either side of my face for my 'layers' and literally, that was it. seriously -- my cut couldn't have taken more than five minutes. she didn't even make sure the layers were even. whatever. my hair doesn't look any different, so it could be worse, but man, what a bummer. from now on, i'll go somewhere else for professional opinions and some personality from the person cutting my hair."
i took my 6yr old for a simple cut. i just wanted four inches taken off the length. at the place the girl did a dry cut which i didn't think anything of. well we get home and after a shower i'm brushing her hair and it's completely lopsided. worst haircut ever.
"i love my cut , root touch up and highlights by maxine.  stopped by supercuts after the stylist from a groupon i purchased was a no show and maxine filled the void.  everything happens for a reason.  i'm happy i got stood up and found maxine."
this is the 3rd time i've been to supercuts and i always leave satisfied.i have thick short hair and it's a pain to maintain it. i'm very picky with who touches my hair. my hair stylists has been claire (sorry if i misspelled the name) .. she is amazing! she knows how to clean up my hair without taking too much length off.i recommend and trust her
"their website shows $12.95 for kids cut and also $12.95 for seniors over 62. so i take my daughter and my father to get haircuts. the haircuts could have been better and the staff there are unfriendly and unenthusiastic - fine whatever. i get to the register and all of a sudden the price is $14.50 for my kid and $16.50 for my dad. when i asked why the prices are different on the supercuts website my reply was: ""they took those prices away last week"". ya, right. f--- you and your f------ store. goodbye."
"great haircuts and coloring and waxing!!the hair professionals know what to do!  very witty, personable and helpful.our family drives past many other salons on our way to this particular supercuts for a reason!!"
"came to this supercuts because it was close to my work and i wanted a trim all my ends off they were getting really gross and just not attractive looking. the lady who helped me listened to want i wanted and kept my length, and the other lady ( sorry i don't know the names) helped cut my hair. my hair is healthier and still kept my length and more layers. i love how it looks. definitely recommend this location the ladies know what they are doing !"
"i came to this location the other day with my daughter to get hair cuts. i explained that my hair was so long, thick and that it was getting too complicated to keep up with the military appearance since the bun was getting too big. i asked for a pretty basic hair cut, i would think... to cut three inches, straight across my back and to thin it out. when straightened my hair the next day, i realized that i had a lot of random chunks of hair that was longer than the actual cut. i had to have my husband cut the obvious parts until i could take some leave to get another hair cut. this is kind of the last thing i wanted to worry about. sometimes attention to detail can go a long way."
"if i could give this experience of -5 i would. i wear my hair pretty short and i went in there and showed a picture to the girl that cut my hair and told her i wanted it cut just a little bit shorter than that picture because i have to get it cut too often and before i could say anything she took clippers and went up the back of my head. cutting it almost to my scalp.  i had been explaining to her what a bad year it been.. i've had 3 surgeries, my mom and dad both passed away and i was so looking forward to my birthday coming up that weekend because i hadn't been out much in the last year due to medical and i had to cancel my birthday party because she basically shaved my head. i'm not a confrontational person and i was extremely upset and i did not want to cry so i just paid her and left. i called the manager to explain the whole thing to her i sent her before picture and after  picture i was promised not only to get my money back but that i would hear back from the manager and that still has not happened so i will never ever go here again. luckily i am on medical leave and don't have to leave my house.  i put a hoodie on to walk my dog because i'm so embarassed of my hair ( or lack thereof).."
"i wish i could remember the name of the lady that cut my hair.  it was the fastest, better looking haircuts i have ever had.  she didn't try to make small talk, which i really appreciated.  she cut my hair in about 7 minutes flat!"
terrible haircut. she took only about 10 minutes to cut my hair and it looked uneven. i then told her and she said that's just the way my hair was. now i have to go back to get it fixed. i would never pay any amount to get my hair cut there again.
"usually take a chance with other supercuts..but this place was clean, modern, and most importantly i got a great haircut.  darci totally listened to what i wanted and did it quickly and beautifully.  went late morning monday..no wait..and the best $15.00 haircut.  next time, plan on taking advantage of their color."
"went here last week to find they had totally remodeled the place.  lookin' good supercuts! again, sara saved the day, color and cut and making me lovely to look at once again.  new color dye burns a little more than the old stuff, but the color is amazing!  go!  you know you wanna look good!  just go!no, they don't take appointments!"
"great staff, great customer service, great hair cuts!  the experience is as wonderful as the cut. they really took the time to understand and cut my hair the way i wanted it done. wow! -keep up the great work team."
"i always get so nervous when finding a good hair dresser! i don't like when i sit in someone's chair and they tell me what i want or what they think is best for me! but what i really hate is when i go in for a trim and come out 4 inches shorter :/ i also don't want to pay $50 for a hair trim. i was extremely lucky to have colene take care of me! i was very picky asking if she can cut my hair dry, i just know that's what works for me. i was okay if it couldn't be done but i could just tell i could trust her, she definitely knew what she was doing! colene was so friendly about all my crazy request! i have been growing my hair out for years now and i just needed to be sure it didn't get messed up. i am beyond happy with super cuts and this location. i paid $17 for a trim. but i was also surprised to see they do waxing and color! this is my new spot for my hair and eyebrows :)"
"i got a really great haircut from kelsey 3 mos ago and so i returned 3 mos later for another.  she wasn't as enthusiastic as last time and left me with nothing short of loss for words. two other stylists picked up that i was not happy with the cut and made me feel better immediately.  cassandra and nicole rescued me and reassured me i wasn't leaving until i got the cut i wanted and was happy. thank you , thank you , thank you girls for making my day. you are the definition of customer service. i understand we all have bad days so i wasn't mad or anything at kelsey i was in fact a little disappointed,  but no big deal. this location has great stylists. i will be back."
"i walked in for a cut and color around 3:40pm last friday, and i am so happy with my hairdresser cassandra! she did a phenomenal job and just knows what to do in regards to mixing the colors (i showed her a photo for reference) and trimming where it needed to be, which was 8 inches, so glad that i did! i felt a bit bad, cassandra had to stay after hours to finish up deep conditioning/shampoo/cut. she was very patience and i did not feel rushed at all! thank you again! :)"
"got a great trim and style while here on vacation. the male stylist was great, i forgot to get his name. i was in a hurry to make a portrait shot with my family. i totally recommend this place if you need a cut or style on a sunday."
"robyn nicole is amazing!!! she listens and pays so close attention to every little detail. she totally gets it!!! she is fun, spunky and most of all the sweetest person ever!!! i love, love, love my hair and will continue to come back. in fact,  i don't see myself going to anyone else.... she is perfect in every way."
"robyn is the best! i just moved to arizona from la and have had some pretty fancy hairdressers. she is so patient, creative and really works with me on my vision of my hair. i always leave happy and w hair better than i could of thought up by myself."
"beware! i was just charged $45 for an awful braid, and didn't even wash my hair. i had her redo it once and then just said i liked it so i can go home and redo it. the woman seemed very inexperienced as she made my hair look nothing like the picture i showed her. it took three people to figure out how to ring me up. never going back!"
"just left this place feeling like a new woman! colene is amazing. she listened to what i needed and delivered that and more. my hair feels so much healthier and manageable. she made me feel relaxed and i had a good time chatting with her. she wasn't pushy about selling any products but made some awesome recommendations. i bought the olive oil shampoo and conditioner along with the super skinny serum which i am super excited to use. the online check in was easy and efficient. the hours and days this location is open is so convenient! great experience from the online check-in, to walking out the door. thank you, colene and supercuts, for probably the best hair cut i have ever experienced!"
"i went there to get highlights for my hair. joshua was very helpful. he listened carefully to what i wanted, and recommend exactly what would suit me and my hair type. the results turned out to be amazing. i decided to get a haircut as well. joshua helped me tame my voluminous, thick hair by giving me the right amount of layers, while still maintaining the length of it. it was a very good first experience for me. everyone working in the salon was very nice and pleasant. what i loved the most was that joshua answered all my questions very patiently."
really slow and not great haircut this evening. she worked on my hair for over an hour and never was able to really get what i was telling her i wanted. now that i know which one she is i will avoid her in the future. don't have a name because she didn't have a cosmetology license displayed at her station. normally this place is great but the lady who cut my hair this evening was a disaster.
"new to the area and needed someone to fix a haircut that went wrong.  stopped in and joshua was available right away to help me.  super friendly, professional and he fixed my botched haircut! definitely recommend!"
"i came to supercuts for color a few years back as an emergency as i used to go to expensive high end salons but could not get in. i came in for color and it was the best service i ever received. i have been coming back for my color ever since. i am always complimented on my color. gavin, robin and joshua are great!!"
hey guys. we also have a review system called my salon listens. that is sent to your email after a service. don't let all yelp reviews push you away from coming into our salon. :)  always working harder to improve and to deliver the best services. we welcome you in again. or if you're new we would be pleased to have you become part of our family.
this place is solid for a quick haircut that isnt gonna set you back 30 dollars for someone that gets their haircut twice a month 15 dollars a trip isnt so badif you want a good haircut then tell them how you like it- they stylists ive had have always been very receptive and talkative to keep me entertained
"ok, i'm done. done i tell you. i cannot get a consistent haircut from these folks. my hair is simple. number 3 on the sides, trimmed on the top, kinda ""boxy"" style, and not a uniform buzz cut. i only have one cowlick at the crown of my noggin. these past 3 times, i tell the lady my simple hair cut. i have had to return later in the day or the next day to get all the straggler hairs, the uneveness, and basically my whole head re-cut. and they don't even get that right. they just run the clippers over it to even it out and i leave with a standard buzz cut. but this last chance was the last straw. the same lady, whom i dreaded seeing when i walked in and she said ""come on back"" was free and thus was going to cut my hair. she spent an inordinate amount of time cutting my hair, using all types of fancy scissors and giant plastic pitchfork looking things, but mostly spent the 45 minutes talking and really....not focusing on cutting my hair. when she was finished, i immediately noticed again, how she did not even bother to trim my cowlick. when i pointed it out to her, she says ""i'm not finished, i just wanted you to see how it looks so far""...malarky! she then got out the clippers and basically gave me a very, very, very uneven buzz cut. and....the past 3 cuts from her, i still have all the scraggly hairs above and behind my ears that i just trim when i get home!since i left with it so short, i would have been pointless to get it corrected....that would just entail me shaving my head myself. so i'm going to listen to my wife and go to a barber or pay a little more at a salon or just go shaggy. i know it's only 15 bucks, but my hair is not that complicated and i guess i just expected a decent haircut every once in a while. but 3 in a row....the fool is me."
"super cheap, nice people, and i was in and out with a new cut. whats there to complain about?"
i love billi at supercuts.  i have been coming to her store for almost a year now.  my hair has never been healthier.  i color my hair and billi has done an incredible job with my color and style.    i have been tpo the expensive 'scottsdale salons' and have walked out very unhappy.   she is pleasant and fun to talk to. the price is great and the service is excellent!
"kisha is a well seasoned stylist who not only understands hair but listens as well!  i loved that she didn't fill the time in her chair with pointless chatter as much as her pointed attention on how i requested my hair cut. she has such a natural sense- didn't take me right to the shampoo bowl but actually cut my hair mostly dry to watch it react to what she was doing it's been painstaking to find a stylist and a positive experience getting my hair done. bottom line is, i don't want the a-line you cut, i want the a-line that works with my cow licks and waning hairline like i communicated. :) thanks k!  you understand where it starts, listening."
"we went here and ask for how long , the reciptionist say 10' waiting and after 15' wait i went to ask her ( cause i see her take couple people in ) she tell me to wait other 20' cause she have appoint them came ? what the hell she told me cause she didn't know appointments will came in ? omg  ...."
"they close at 7 i came in at 645 there was 2 barbers and only 1 person waiting but they ""didn't have enough time to do my hair"" i get it shaved. this place doesn't like to make money or cut hair"
"i was skeptical to come here because they butchered my hair in april 2015, but i wanted to give them a second chance. the woman who cut my hair did an amazing job! she made my hair look amazing! definitely will be coming back again."
"i showed up early for my appointment and waited until my appointment time. the stylist instead took a walk in. i explained that scheduled clients should get priority over a walk in, but they obviously don't undersrtand how appointments work at this location. extremely frustrating as i've spent the past 10 days in the hospital with a loved one and i tried to take 30 minutes away for myself. this was such a huge waste of my time."
love coming here to get my haircut. jason always pays attention to details and does a great job.   i always look great when he cuts my hair. i strongly recommend you ask for him.
i always have a good experience. if you use the app to check-in you will not have to wait very long. have been using this store for about six years with no problems.
"we've been going here since this location opened, and we'd never had a bad experience until today. my wife has psoriasis on her scalp, and it's noted on her account. every time we go, they say something about dandruff. read the notes, please, it's not dandruff! then today, the girl at the front desk told her she couldn't cut her hair today, because her scalp was irritated. she wasn't rude about it, but she was loud, and instead of reading the notes on the account, she advised my wife that she should see a doctor about it. thanks for the kind suggestion."
"i've been waiting for 15 minutes for the store to open and still nobody has shown up. the hours posted say 9am, and it is now well after 9."
"another great cut!  this place has the nicest people.  music needed to be a little more upbeat, but hey, i'm there for a haircut, not a concert."
not the best by far. i am going to stick to my location over at camelback .
"why do employees have to be rude! this place was terrible from the first time i stepped in. it was as though i was bothering them. they were slow at cutting hair, unprofessional and i would not recommend them based on my personal experience."
"i wish there was an option for 0 stars, cuz they don't even deserve one. we checked in and told them we had two people, and seeing as there was two of us standing there, i don't see how that would be so difficult to understand. 15 minute wait, not bad. wandered around, came back, i came up to the counter and the guy walked away, not a word, just turned his back on me and left. a little irritated, i turned on my heel and walked out, decided to try again in a few minutes. we come back in and the nice lady at the counter asked for our names, (unintentionally?) makes fun of my boyfriends name, and tells me that since the first idiot never asked for my name, i had to wait behind the other 5 people that came in after me. livid. guess you get what you pay for."
"i went to get my haircut today. for the past several months i have been growing out my mustache and my hair. i now have a great handlebar mustache and my hair has begun to feather back nicely. i told the gentleman i was looking for a haircut to match my mustache, a longer hairstyle. i told him i wanted it a bit shorter on the sides and longer up top. he spun me around to show me a couple of pictures of men with buzz cuts. i said no, *much* longer. i mean come on, my hair was feathered back! so he nods like he knows what i'm talking. before i know it, he's using clippers on my hair! i say loudly (to be heard over the clipper) that he's cutting my hair too short! he smiles, nods and proceeds to buzz cut my hair!i'm shocked at this point! who would buzz cut feathered back hair without telling the customer??? i let the gentleman know again that he is cutting my hair too short. again with the stupid grin and nod. again with the complete disregard to what i'm saying. and he buzzes away my hair. my wife could hear me from across the salon. she's telling my daughter that i'm not happy, because she can hear my complaints. he cut off well over four inches of hair from the sides and back! i stopped him at this point and i remind him of what i asked for. just a bit shorter on the sides, not short! he tries to tell me that he misunderstood. i remind him that i well saying it's too short. several times. he ignored me. in the end, he finished my haircut and offered his apologies. the haircut itself looks presentable with enough product in it. i hate wearing product in my hair. although the haircut is presentable, it is not what i asked for. i remind the gentleman that i will now have to wear his apology for months, until my hair grows back out. do not get your hair cut here, unless you want someone else to decide how they're going to cut your hair. the stylist (vietnamese gentleman) does not listen!"
"went in yesterday to get my hair cut for summer.i waited for an hour , when the wait time was 20 minutes when i showed up and the girl was rude. i asked for an angled bob and they cut my hair without even doing the finger test to see if it was too short. after it was cut, i heard to late to go back and now i have a haircut that barely pulls into a ponytail like i asked for and short sides which i did not ask for. i used to go here all the time and this will be the last time."
"first time reviewer... because of my frustration during this visit.the benefit of places like super cuts and great clips is that, while they may not have the best stylists, it is usually possible to quickly get in or out.  while visiting relatives, i stopped in to get a haircut and was told there would be 35 (seemed pretty precise) minute wait. there were three people in the lobby waiting on haircuts.  at this point i had an hour before i needed to leave for dinner so i decided to wait.after waiting for 30 minutes a dad and his two sons arrived.  one stylists took the dad, and i assumed he had a call-in appointment.  i was slightly irritated that they did not tell me there were three call-in appointments, as i doubted this gentleman would get his hair cut in 5 minutes. i didn't want to spend those thirty minutes waiting for nothing; however, i should have considered the sunk cost of my time. the second stylist took a person that was previously in the lobby. when the first stylist was finished with the father he took the second son.  even though it had been nearly an hour i was thinking, ""at least i'm next in line for the stylist that is taking lobby patrons.""  at nearly exactly the one hour mark the dad walked over to me and apologized, as he had noticed my long wait.  as i assumed, they had booked appointments over the phone.  i informed him that i was not upset with him at all, but what a nice gesture. the stylists did not inform me of this, the customer did.  the second stylist finished with her lobby patron and move on to... the third son. at this time (an hour and 15 minutes into my wait). my wife gave up waiting for me to pick her up, and started walking to this location from the nearby mall.  i informed my family that i would be very late for dinner.i finally was called back. no ""thank you for waiting, no sorry for your wait, no explanation that they had to serve the call-in customer first,"" nothing. as i got my hair cut in silence, the stylist pinched my neck in the apron snap.  i couldn't hold back a small yelp of pain.  no apology.  silent hair cut continues.  usually a stylist will slap his or her comb against my forehead multiple times during a haircut.  truly a testament to their speed as they switched from collecting strands to cutting said strands.  this stylist got me right in the eyeball with the comb's teeth. another small yelp of pain.  no apology. i finally finished my haircut.  a total of 12 words... jason, how you like it?, this short?, strong hair, coupon?, and twenty dollars"" were spoken from the time i sat down to the time i left.  i was offered 3, $2 off coupons. not only would i not return once, i would not return three times for sure. because i am not one to complain with no solutions in mind, here is how this location could have salvaged this situation, and should treat future (not me) customers. know the schedule for those customers that have called in an appointment so that you do not tell someone 35 minutes, then leave them waiting for ~1 hour and 20 minutes before they see a stylist.  if this egregious breakdown occurs, promptly inform the customer of your error and provide him or her of his new wait time, so he can make an informed decision whether he wants to continue to wait or cut his losses.  if the customer decides to wait, acknowledge the customer's wait and apologize for wait.  on final suggestion, please take the ""walk-ins welcome"" sign off your window."
prices just went down on color
"i got my hair cut there last week. its a great place with awesome customer service. stephen cut my hair and it looks awesome definitely recommend him, he gave me exactly what i asked for."
"good color, good stylists, and good conversations, it's hard to trust anyone with my hair, but stephen does amazing work! he's worked some magic, i definitely will return!!!!!!!!"
"clean,  very spacious,  amazing stylists! i'd definitely recommend this place for your next cut, color, or style.  definitely check this place out."
"meh - this location is great because it is centrally located in tempe and easily accessible if you live on or near campus. the stylists are often inexperienced and unprofessional however. i would say this is a average location for supercuts, at best. expect a wait and know exactly what you want, since the stylists aren't great at helping you make a decision. this location would do better if they had more stylists and could reduce their turnover."
"supercuts seems pretty good that it's close to campus. unfortunately i had an unhappy experience. called ahead prior to closing and asked if they had room and what time they closed. they said they stay open until 7pm and that they had a 2min wait. i call a lyft to get there prior to closing and come through the door only to be told that they don't have room to fit me in. i arrived exactly 30 minutes prior to closing and got there within 10 minutes of calling them.ended up wasting $5 to get out there. i wish the staff would've said something over the phone as opposed to giving misinformation.case in point, if you call in be weary of the info they give you."
"i got my haircut yesterday from a great lady. while i can't remember her name, she did the very common ""white boy"" haircut.. common blend from a low 1 to a high 3, with a pompadour haircut up top. she blended it and helped even out all of the inconsistencies i was having in my hair and with previous barbers. definitely coming back!"
i never give reviews but i had exceptional service with alexandra. she went above and beyond with my haircut. she not only gave me a good haircut in what i asked for but gave me a lot of advice in how to take care of my hair. i appreciate that sooo much. thank you!
went to supercut at rural and university cornerstone many times and i prefer alexandria when i make the appointment there.she is very particular when cutting hair and i like that  ..you  will know the difference if u give her a shot you will see! guys and gals ....
"just had one of the best haircuts ever! enjoyed conversation with darcy and team, fun place to get a cut. thanks guys! great haircut too, best i've had in awhile as well."
"wouldn't let me 8 year son use their bathroom, will never go here for haircut...,..ccxxxxxxxx cxxxxxxx."
"please don't make the mistake i did and go here just because you see some (somehow perfect) 5 star reviews. i imagine those reviews were ""bought"" somehow. i went here after work today and had a terrible experience. i wanted about an inch off (i had very long hair) and now it is above my shoulder with sloppy layers (some so short they are probably 2 1/2 inches in length). i will own up to my own error in this, as i agreed to a shorter cut but not this short as i explicitly said below the shoulder and was very reluctant about the layers.furthermore, i've always been outspoken about what i call ""hair salon bullying"". this is a hair stylist belittling your current style/color in order to sell you a color or cut they envision for you (and potentially so they can make more $). ""what is that crazy bleach job you have going on?"" ""so the last person who cut your hair, they obviously didn't know what they were doing, did they?"" my stylist did all of the above, making me feel like, ""oh nice, so you're telling me i've been walking around looking like sh*t the last few months..."" it puts me in a vulnerable place and i want to hear the professional's opinion. however, that said, i took her advice and went shorter than i planned but it still did not come out as promised which was supposed to be longer than shoulder length. and the layers are so inconsistent, choppy, and poorly done that a friend asked me if i had a mullet in the front. just horrible. stay away!"
"don't go. they will butcher your hair. the employee turnover is crazy. you will never see the same person twice. only go if it's your last resort. seriously, the people here have no experience or commitment to the hair styling industry. they do it in the side to further their actual careers (if any)"
"i was very dubious about going here since i saw on yelp the number of low reviews this location has but was in desperate need for a bang cut so i decided to go and take the chance. i got melanie (who i strongly recommend; she's very nice and listens to needs) and she took care of my bang cut perfectly per my needs! it's been a week since i got them cut here and i am happy with how it looks. now keep in mind this review is for a plain hair cut and not dramatic styling or hair color. for simple hair cuts or trims, this place seems perfectly capable and is convenient bc of its proximity to school ^o^ have no complaints here."
this place is terrible. it was my only night off and i called ahead to see if they could get me in. they told me it would be 15 minutes before i could get in. almost an hour later they still hadn't said a single word to me. thanks for wasting my only night off. i should have gone somewhere else. now i have to do it myself! just terrible. if you are understaffed and can't fit me in then fing tell me. don't make me waste my time! i am furious.
can someone please tell me why tammy took liberties with my child's hair?  i said a trim not to hack it & shape it without asking first.  she has curly hair that used to be allb one length.  she went crazy with the clippers to the ends.  my daughter's hair isn't what we wanted & we left with frizzy hair.
always get my hair cut here. don't try and get your eyebrows waxed. two times so far i've been denied. once i was told oh i don't know how and another time oh the wax isn't warm enough! if you offer a service it should be available or post times it is available.
first hair cut salon in arizona for me and i'd say it went wonderfully. no one ever gets personal and asks that many questions to make sure you got the hair cut you came asking for. i would highly recommend it. also try their green tea shampoo and conditioner. just ask them about it. you won't regret it. the price was decent but everything was to my liking.
rip off and bad service. $65 later and they sent me out the door without even fixing my hair. i have never been to a hair salon that doesn't dry and style your hair after you've paid an arm and a leg for a service.  horrible.
stopped by asu to visit the boy and took him for a long overdue haircut. we waited about 10 minutes and the haircut did the trick.
"my story goes like this.  i went in and requested a simple fade and explicitly requested that it be at medium height.  i even said ""don't give me a marine hair cut"".  i took off my glasses and don the cape, the women (who happened to be the manager) who was to cut my hair spun me away from the mirror and started to cut.  about 3 minutes later (yeah seriously 3 minutes!!!!! wtf) she stated she was finished, so i put my glasses back on to see what the finished product looked like.  how do you think she did, was she such a master that she could give a world class hut cut in record time?  nope!!!  she gave me a high and tight, seriously a damn hight and tight.  the one thing i asked her not to do she did, and the shit eating grin on her face said ""yeah i know what you said but i don't give a crap, i just want to get back to facebook"".  i was so pissed that i just bit my tongue and said nothing or else i'd have flipped out on this lady.  so, i get home and start to check out the magnum opus this picasso of hair styling had created and i find a huge, make that ridiculously huge chunk of hair the size of two thumbs uncut and sticking out from the rest of the disaster.  seriously wtf!!!!!!  i still to this day think she did that purposely because there's no way to miss some shit like that.  i get back in my car and return to the store, i politely wait for another stylist (even though the hair terrorist was free) to take me back and do some damage control.  i could tell she was having a hard time saving as much as possible because the blending was sooooo bad and uneven however, she did what she could and i appreciate that (oh she also told me that the hair terrorist doesn't know how to do fades correctly because she is classically trained or some crap).  this women knew she didn't have the skill set to cut my hair and put me in a booth anyways.  way to go supercuts, that's taking initiative, after all it's better to take someone's money once and not give them what they paid for so they'll never return than having them wait 10 minutes to get what they came for.  after this very pleasant and skilled young lady is finished fixing the debacle on my cranium i politely request a refund.  i actually shouldn't have paid for the hair cut in the first place but i wanted no drama.  nevertheless, i had to drive all the way back here to have someone do damage control so i was not feeling like i owned them any money for any of this fiasco.  of course i had to go through the hair terrorist to get said refund, and that went over like a fart in church.  it was obvious that she really really really did not want to refund my money, why, i have no clue.  after politely asking and explaining that the requested refund was based on principle, her retort basically amounted to the theory of using it to pay for the second haircut i got, yeah the one where they fixed what she jacked up in the first place.  she wanted to keep the money and transfer the ""credit"" to the other stylist.  seeing how as i was going to use the refund to tip the second stylist anyways and that by this time i was immensely annoyed with the hair terrorist and could handle no more of her crap i just agreed and left.moral of the story:  don't come here with any expectation because, apparently you don't need to know how to cut hair to work at this supercuts or for the matter to even manage the damn place.  to be fair though there is at least one talented individual working here."
"my best friend and i went in here on a sunday, fed up with mall prices. i had the best  hair cutting experience ever! loved the men cutting our hair, and it's the best cut i've had in years! p. s. get the tea tree oil treatment."
"bianca gave me the greatest joy by giving me a great haircut.  she knew what she was doing and cut to perfection.  that is rare for me to say.  i usually sign in online, but this time i was a walk in.  there was no wait time for me.  i highly recommend bianca if you go to this location.  i'm confident you will be as pleased as i am if she cuts your hair."
the guy that cut my hair was awesome!! he did a great job and was super friendly. the only reason this review is bad is because they didn't honor a coupon that apparently was only for another location. again not the fault of the employee but a bad policy of the company.
my family and i go to this super cuts a few times a month at times and always ask for amanda. one thing i appreciate about amanda is that she listens to you. i often ask for a trim at places and will get too much cut off :( but when i have visited amanda she hears me and cuts exactly what i asked for. my son and my daughter say the same thing. we have waited at times for amanda to be scheduled. :)
"very happy with my hair! i had a basic cut and then balayage color. amanda rocked it! she is super friendly, knows the importance of listening to her clients, and was accommodating to all my requests. great attention to detail and excellent price! the other stylists were friendly too, and did a great job with their clients from what i could tell because there were many happy regular customers. this supercuts is a winner! and i had no idea supercuts even did color, but i gave it a shot and will definitely be back to see amanda in the future."
"this is the worst haircut that ive had in my life. i told the hairdresses very simple instructions, even showed her a picture of my last haircut which was very simple, and still messed up my hair. its a girl with black hair with dyed hair on top. she is the worst! wont be going back there again"
"great supercuts.  i have been going to this location for at least 1 year now and have never had any problems or issues.  i always get my hair cut by the manager anthony which i am always pleased with.  the only down fall (it's not their fault) is sometimes the wait is long, but that should tell you they are good at cutting hair!"
"as a long time customer and a college student....i am a faithful customer....your rates are best one can find in the city....i just moved from san marcos, tx to san antonio.....after growing at my hair for a year i find cutting it hard...a man without his hair is like a women is who isnt pretty....that said going into a supercuts : i was completely dismayed.....while my hair was getting cut...my hair cutter was also cutting a little boys hair....i live in a classy part of san antonio and was recently invited to a ritzy party in downtown now i dont know if i can show my face....before the incident i looked like a respected individual ready for classes in two weeks....now i look like a punk with no hair going to the military....when i was receiving my hair cut i asked for my sides to be thinned not a mohawk..... if this is how you treat an individual much needs to be improved with your company and the faculty that represents you!....."
"it was fall time and i just moved here not too long ago, and my hair was practically to my waist. since my hair is very thick, it made me sweat a lot, and i wanted a change. i went in and the service was very friendly. i sat down and told her i just wanted it shorter, because my hair just makes me sweat and i hated it. maybe a pixie? a side cut?  i told her i didn't want anything near cutting to my shoulders, because i have a round face, and it looks so stupid when i have shoulder length hair. (picture a beach ball with a wig on.) i also told her i wanted a darker color. she said she didn't have time to dye it, and i would have to come back the next day 10 am. i told her never mind on the color, and just do the cut.  she did an under cut to my ears, and shortened my hair. i told her i also wanted front bangs, and she said straight bangs wouldn't look good with my face shape, so she gave me this weird side bang (which i hated afterwards) her co worker offered to color my hair since she was off soon. she brought out the color wheel, and i told her i didn't want anything red, since i have lots of red tones in my face. she showed me this beautiful dark brown/black with purple highlights, which wasn't overwhelming for work at all. and next to it was this red violet color. and she said ""this one suits you!"" i said it was a bit too red for my taste, and she said the red isn't that noticeable. so she dyed my hair. i was there for almost 3 hours. with my glasses off, i cant see whats going on, so she finishes it i put my glasses on and she turned me around. side bang, shoulder hair, and it was a dark red/burgundy color. i wasn't sure how to feel. i liked the undercut a lot. i paid 75 for everything. (which i'm never doing again) about a week later, i hated the hair color so much i ended up re-dying it back to a dark brown.the length has grown out, but i never wear it down, because it's too hot!i feel bad for not saying anything ( i think one of the ladies was still learning to cut hair), but i wont be coming back here."
i will never go back. i got my hair cut and was totally not happy. i went back 2 days later to get a redo and i'm still not happy.
this place is short staffed often only having one stylist even on saturdays. the stylist are often not well trained. the store has stayed in disrepair for several years.
store doesn't close until 8.employee didn't want to work so said they closed at 5... where does it say they close at 5 on a tuesday? nowhere!! lazy ass employee.wouldn't even come to the door to tell me why they were closed early
staff was not interactive. but stylist did a good job. overall satisfied with the service but could improve customer interaction skills. thanks to my gal for making me contribute to yelp.
"advertise to skip the wait by making an appointment online, well, the workers there do not know this... visited on saturday, 11/26/16, and made online appointment for 5:30pm.  i get there 10 minutes early, and the decide to take another customer before me.  then, a few minutes after my appointment, the girl cutting hair tells me that they are taking another customer because he got to the salon before i did...  what's the point on online apts if you're gonna pull this crap?  horrible!"
i think this is a great place for a quick and affordable haircut and style. i've been to this location on a few occasions and its always busy and there appears to be a number of regulars. this is our go-to place for my guy's haircut in between trims that i give him. i find the stylists i be nice and helpful and relatively fast. if you do not know what style you want i recommend that you do some homework first. they do have some style books but not many and you won't find tons of magazines in in the waiting area -- so bring something with you if you are waiting on someone -- but the wait is generally never over 30 min total unless you are in a peak time like saturday afternoon or back to school time.
i must say for a place to recieve so much traffic. one would think there should be more employees working here. i was told 30 minute wait but it has been 1 hour and 30 minutes. they forgot to mention customers call in instead if waiting so they come first. if thats the case then they need more hair dressors.
"this supercuts is great. very good customer service and even better cuts. i've been coming to supercuts ever since i was younger. they're always kind and greet you when you walk in the door. it's always best to call in ahead of time so that way when you get there, you don't have to worry about waiting 30-45 minutes for a cut. highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice haircut."
"came here a few days ago.  the place is a disaster.  it was at least 30 minutes wait before they took me in, considering that i reserved a time slot on line.  but that is just the tip of the issue.  there were only 2 individuals cutting hair.  they were not even cleaning up before the next customer is serviced.  they had everyone's hair scattered all over the floor.  it was disgusting.  it was late and i just went along with it.  i shouldn't have since my hair was cut by some 3rd rate stylist.  well, i'm not coming back here again."
they don't have enough stylists for the demand. they also don't notify you of your place in line. especially vs online checking. i sat waiting for over 40 minutes before being told that i was still behind 2 more people because of online check ins. this is not the way to do business. i'm going back to great clips.
"if you want a lazy and half assed cut, come here!i brought l my brother in for a haircut today and while waiting, we noticed the hair stylist clarissa, seemed very rude and unwelcoming while talking to other guests that walked in the door. unfortunately, that's who we got but we gave her the benefit and requested that she give him a fade with 2 on the sides and a 3 on top (realize that boy's hair grows extremely fast and we request the same thing every month and get the results we want). i also explained that my terminology may be wrong but i explained the look, short on the sides, and longer on top. she started cutting, and customers flocked in and i see her just buzz his entire head so then i go up to clarissa, already in awe at what she did and ask her to fade his hair, the least she can do after giving him a military cut, not what we asked for, she replies ""there's too many customers waiting."" i gladly gave her no tip, and not to mention, she had nails that were 2 inches long, not sure how she's cutting hair at all to begin with. save your kids the embarrassment at school, take them else where."
friday at 10:00 am.  for the 3rd time only 1 employee and long wait.  i dont know why this place is not staffed but i wont be coming to this location anymore.
very good experience here! everyone was nice and professional. my hair stylist was great! she did exactly what i wanted and i'm very pleased with the outcome.
"terrible customer service. went in had to wait 25 min for my son to get a hair cut, when it was my daughters turn the girl got up and went to lunch, without a saying a word, making me wait another 20 min to get her hair cut"
"when i walked in, everyone was cutting hair, but one of the stylists looked over and acknowledged me, so i took a seat. two other customers came after me, and she wholeheartedly greeted each of them, even ensuring they were put on the list. it was only myself and those two customers who came after me in the waiting area, so i feel i was outright ignored. i guess because i have a beard, it's okay to discriminate against me and ignore me. this is pathetic if you ask me and i'm glad i'm the first to review these racists. as soon as she took one of the customers ahead of me, i simply walked out. i don't have time to argue with these low-lifes. what goes around comes around!"
"the staff always does a great job.   very welcoming and courteous.   michelle usually cuts my hair and does an awesome job,but if she is booked up, the rest of the stylist on hand will always do a great job."
"5 stars! isis is a baller, ask for her! the staff here is consistent and good. i bring my son here at least twice a month and typically have isis cut his hair. every hairstylist here is good. isis is great. she is fast with kids which makes it easy on the kiddos attention span. her fades are quality top notch leaving no lines visable. i have had to use three other stylists for my son here. they all were good.tip: i call before i leave the house to get pur name on the list which takes you to the front of the line as soon as you walk in the front door. i think you can do this online too."
"see posted pic. this was taken before getting it fixed at another place. she trimmed so high above my ear. it was unprofessional. she didn't tell me she screwed up, so she could fix it. had a co worker point it out. thanks for that. this place is a chop shop."
absolute worst haircut i have ever had.  went to get hair trimmed for a wedding.  told the girl i would like long layers and just evened up a little.  she butchered my hair.  all different lengths and basically a short shag from the 70s !!  i just wanted to cry.  still do.  there is no way to fix it until it grows out.  it will be about 6 months.  the only reason i am giving them one star is to write a review.  this chop job is devastating.  im completely embarassed.  the girl that cut my hair should be fired.  i dont believe for one minute that she went to school to learn to cut hair.
went in as a last minute walk in. i needed my daughters hair cut for back to school and they were able to accommodate us immediately.  mallorie was friendly and really good with my daughter.  (age 6). i am definitely going back for myself and all my girls haircuts..
"crapercuts: what i asked for is not what i received. not even close. i asked for a shaped cut and even showed a picture, all i got was a buzz cut. my wife said i could do better myself and i have with my electric clippers from costco. don't be fooled by the advertisements or positive reviews. i am continually dissatisfied with this business chain.$14.99 wasted! i am will never visit this business chain again."
"i have short wavy hair, cut like halle berry. i tried four other salons ranging in price and amenities, and i couldn't get a good haircut in san antonio.then i drove by and thought i'd try this salon - out of desperation and with no expectations.  jeannetta was amazing.  i haven't had a haircut this good since i left miami years ago.  and when i found out how affordable it was, i almost fell out.  for what i paid for one hair cut at a previous place, i can get three haircuts here.   and it's a nice, clean shop in a great location.  i'll never go anywhere else in tx.thank you jeannetta. you were not only very proficient, but kind and fun to talk to."
"kortney always does an amazing job which is why i return regularly. i used to pay a lot more for haircuts and drive across town to get them because i assumed that meant better quality but she does my hair as well as any of them and is a lot more pleasant in addition to being conveniently located.the beard trims and shampoos are also great. the stylists are all very pleasant, which to me is at least as important as the skill. i recommend you go and ask for kortney (yes, spelled with a k).also, be sure to try to potato salad. it's pretty good."
"could be the worst haircut i have ever gotten. my regular lady is out of the country so emergency haircut it is. i went in the for a trim and shape and came out a new man. oh yeah, definitely a new man.  maybe they shouldn't hire people right out of beauty school"
this establishment processed an un-authorized over-charge on my credit card.  this stylist basically gave herself a higher tip.  i will never come back.
"edit: ever since isis and kourtney have left, the place has really gone down hill. horrible service!very friendly staff. awesome, inexpensive haircuts. i have been going since i moved to the area 1 1/2 yrs ago. location is perfect for the vast sea of houses in and around indian springs/evans area.  so you actually get to avoid the chaos that is 281."
"i arrived as they were opening,  there was no wait and the stylist greeted me with a smile.  the stylist did a great job making suggestions to style my hair and was very polite.  the haircut was great,  the shampoo awesome and the overall treatment very good. i think prior negative reviews may not be fair, i mean honestly...  i recommend it,  close home cheap and good service.  definitely planning on returning with my kids."
"beware!!!  i recently had my haircut at this location and the stylist absolutely ruined my hair.  for the next few months, i'm going to have to wear my hair pulled back in clips due to the fact that the sides don't even match up.  i would go back, but i'm afraid they would just make matters worse.   spend the extra money and go to a salon where the stylists actually care about their work."
"as a long time customer and a college student....i am a faithful customer....your rates are best one can find in the city....i just moved from san marcos, tx to san antonio.....after growing at my hair for a year i find cutting it hard...a man without his hair is like a women is who isnt pretty....that said going into a supercuts : i was completely dismayed.....while my hair was getting cut...my hair cutter was also cutting a little boys hair....i live in a classy part of san antonio and was recently invited to a ritzy party in downtown now i dont know if i can show my face....before the incident i looked like a respected individual ready for classes in two weeks....now i look like a punk with no hair going to the military....when i was receiving my hair cut i asked for my sides to be thinned not a mohawk..... if this is how you treat an individual much needs to be improved with your company and the faculty that represents you!....."
jezebel is fantastic. she listens to her customers to ensure they get the haircut they want. i've not been disappointed with her service.
i have been here 45 minutes   there are 3 workers but only 1 is cutting hair. terrible customer servicei can't imagine who owns this place and allows the workers not to work. don't waste your time. hi somewhere else
omg. if lisa actually cut hair as much as she talked there wouldn't be long waits. i dont think she knows how to cut hair and have a conversation at the same time. everytime she starts talking the cutting stops. even worse when she turns around to talk to the other employees. not everyone wants or cares about your conversations. who cares who is traveling to cancun this weekend. just cut the dang hair. and while we are at it get that damn mop out of tour face you cant even see with that hair hanging over your right eye. looks like my dog
"the swatch i picked for my hair color was the brightest red and when elisa colored my hair and it looked almost black i asked why it was so dark.  ""oh, i just mixed all the colors.""  whaaaaaaaaaat?  my hair looked better when i walked in than when she was done.  instead of charging $45 like all the other hair stylists did (who had done a good job) she charged me $75 without much of an explanation.  it had taken her about an hour longer than the other hairstylists to do the same job and she reeked of smoke.  never again."
"come in when the place was virtually devoid of customers. there was one gal finishing up a haircut, and another standing around doing nothing. the haircut gets finished, and then both stylists just stand around texting and chatting, while no haircuts get done.i got my haircut completed, and went straight to a meeting, where they suggested i get a haircut. i guess i didn't get enough lopped off of my curly mane. parking is easy here, and there's lots of places nearby to hang out at while waiting for your hair cut. the price was higher than i'm accustomed to paying for a hair cut, but i guess this isn't the drive-thru at rio's golden cuts."
"7 people in the waiting area. 0 people cutting hair, down from 1 who just finished a haircut and is now outside.  app said a 5 minute wait, i've now been here 45 minutes with no indication that haircuts will start again soon, because the only other hairdresser here has been talking to some dude for 30 minutes. it's 11:45 on a friday.  jezebel cut my hair and did a great job- but the overall staffing needs some work."
"does anyone know which salon brittani (sp?) moved to? five stars to her, zero stars to the witch that just jacked up my do."
i i have been getting my hair cut by lisa at this location for the last year and she is wonderful. she will give you advice on what cur to get if you're unsure and suggest different practices or cheap products to use. great service!
"butcher job!  been here 5 times since moving to the area.  i don't believe i've seen the same girl twice.  they must have a hugh turnover.  for the most part the cuts have been acceptable.  i'm really not that particular.  i figure it'll grow back quickly.  however, this last time i got a girl named karina, and and absolute butcher job.  took most everything off the top, and left the back really long.  definitely won't let her near me again."
brittini did an excellent job and truly shows how loving what you do can result in a truly exceptional experience for clientele. this was my first visit here and because of the customer service will not be the last.
laura is a great and always has a good attitude. it took me a year to find someone to give me a good haircut in sa. i am glad i found someone who knows what they are doing.  if you do visit this location and need to get a cut ask for laura cause she does a good job and genuinely cares what your hair looks like after you leave...basically she has what others lack which is common sense.
"i couldn't have been happier. the supercuts on stone oak blvd closed and i loved that place!(shout out to jasmine and stacy!)i've was hesitant about where to go, but finally had to get a haircut since i decided to go someplace close to home for a haircut, and i looked silly.  i decided to get the cut fixed at the next closest supercuts. this place was amazing!!  the salon is very nice; the stylists were so nice and professional!  my haircut was perfect!!   the stylists take the time to listen to what you want, ask questions, and then do exactly what you want.can't say enough good about this place. i'll definitely be back!"
"i am not sure about other supercuts locations, but be aware.... if your visiting this location make an appointment online! i walked in around 4:20pm and there was only one hairstylist cutting a gentleman's hair. first thing i thought was ""awesome! no wait."" then the hairstylist asked for my name, and told me she was booked with appointments until after 5pm.  my no wait, turned into a 40-45min wait, no thank you. so i thanked her and left. i don't blame the hairstylist for being the only hairstylist working, or even the fact she was booked with appointments. i do however think that no business can thrive if they have no supply to demand. they definitely need more hairstylists at this location. unfortunately i'll have to take my business elsewhere."
"okay ! won't lie, i was a bit nervous to cut my longggg hair at super cuts. i always thought of them as a men's barbershop, but i was feeling wild and was open for anything ! upon walking in, i was greeted, told the waiting time and received a smile. i was next in line on brittany's chair, and she was extremely helpful attentive to my new hair look desires. she did a fantastic job ! and to top if off, it only cost $15! i would highly recommend her and will be coming back for my trims !"
"my husband went in for a haircut and came out bleeding with blood all over his shirt. the lady cutting his hair never stopped talking about herself and chopped off all of his hair. when he returned home, he had patches of hair left near his neck and has a huge section of scratches and cuts. he was bleeding and had been scratched up. the prices are also more expensive than the other supercuts just just 2 miles away. i get that if you walk in to a low budget barber shop you may get what you pay for, but does that also mean, blood, sweat and tears."
"this location is fairly new and started off strong.  there were plenty of employees and it was in and out.  on my last three visits there has only been one employee and long waits with people who checked in online coming in before you.  unfortunately im going to have to go back to fantastic sam's.  this the supercuts located in bulverde shopping center in san antonio, texas, at bulverde & 1604."
"i made an appt for 715 on my app and it said there was a 35 minute wait. so i got here around 715-716. i walked in and they said hello and to sign in. then about 5-8 mins later, the one stylist said ""you checked in online?"" and i said ""yes ma'am!"" she said ""okay we'll be right with you."" i sat down and about 20 mins later i am/was still waiting. there was another stylist who finished with a client and took another customer that came in about 15 mins after me. i usually don't come here, but i've been her before and never had any other problems. i'm missing my stylist bc she's on maternity leave......"
i always get my haircut way past the time i should.  i like i can go to supercuts and get it cut the day i feel like i really need it.  recommend that you pick your stylist on line and set that appt. up.  this is a walk-in hair company so you may wait if you walk in.   love patty.  she is always friendly and gets the job done. very affordable.  thanks again.
"i needed a quick trim before flying out to a wedding.  patty did a great job and now my hair looks great!  you can't beat the,$13.99 price either (i didn't need a shampoo or blow dry ... that'll run you only $20.00).  i'll be back in 6 weeks!"
"supercuts is always good if you're looking for a quick trim and an unbeatable price for ladies. really can't complain too much when the haircut ends up coming out to less than $20 overall.the stylists are nice, my only beef was that when i went in to get a trim the stylist didn't know how to trim my bangs. their not crazy, just side swept. i could tell when she got to them that she was really struggling with how to cut it and trim it. they kept coming out choppy and uneven all over. since i've had this hair cut for an extremely long time, i've seen the same technique used through different stylists over the years (and throughout different states). i hate to tell people how to do their jobs, but it's also how they learn. i mentioned to her how others have trimmed the bangs and she still seemed extremely lost. was just a concerning since bangs seem really common these days- this easy request turned into somewhat of a nail bitter for me. they didn't get butchered too bad though, i was able to fix them at home- and like i said you can't really complain with a price like that."
"don't go on tuesdays.  only 2 people working and one helping run front counter.   expect a long, long wait due to them being under staffed.  try another place."
you get what you pay for....usually a hit or a miss it really does depend on who you get....i recommend scheduling ahead of time with the right person.
"the service was fast and professional! they said ""25 min wait"" and they did not lie to us. i got my brother a kid's cut and she did an amazing job. the cut was sharp and only cost $10, but as i was standing in line another patron had a coupon, but was unable to use it so she gave it to me! the hair cut was only $7.95! i tipped $4 bucks and i will go back there the next time my brother needs a haircut!"
"great cut, great price - i have a huge amount of hair and jasmine did a fantastic job, from washing to finishing. she talked me through what she recommended, then cut it just like we agreed. add in a superb scalp massage and i'm sold. my husband and our sons also get their hair cut here and they are really happy with both jasmine and gracie. jasmine was working by herself and she did a really good job on my hair while also greeting new customers and checking them in. i didn't feel rushed at all even though she had a client waiting for their turn. great experience and i'll be back!"
"awful. just awful, i explained the simple cut and even showed her pics. i felt bad for the lady cause i shortly learned she had no clue what she was doing, by the time i stopped her, it was too late and my daughter paid the price right before a birthday party. this place is on my ""never again"" list. sadly my husband has gone there for over a year. do not go to this lady!"
"graciela gave me a great haircut!  she listened intently to what i wanted and though it took her extra time, wow, it is perfect!  thank you graciela!  i'll definitely be back cause on top of that, the price was great!  i am so pleased, yes, so very, very pleased."
my husband goes here and doesn't have trouble. i went in and there was one stylist working on someone's hair. she didn't even acknowledge me when i walked in. there was a family that came in as i did and they were acknowledged. i was sitting there and up came another stylist and took one of the family members before me. i just needed a trim and style. i will not be coming back. i can see what others mean by unprofessional.
this location is dated and the staff are unprofessional.  i've seen the hair stylists take personal calls during haircuts.  super long waits even when there is nobody there...
only one hairdresser on staff and she is not friendly at all. to me it seems like she hates life and hates what she is doing
"literally my hair looks like i tried to cut it myself, with a viking sword, without a mirror, with only my left hand. it is truly unbelievable how bad they messed my hair up."
checking in online with their new app is  a complete waste of time. checked in 45 minutes early so once i arrived i could walk in and be serviced. to my surprise both ladies working that evening took multiple clients after me showing up and checking in. at that time i was told that i would be taken care of they did not inform me i would have to wait an additional 20 minutes and  three customer later i was next. then as i left the premises a large gentlemen came out after i had left assuming to make sure no trouble was to be started.... since when were workers spouses/ boyfriends allowed to start sitting in chairs behind the counter where stylists work and act like a hired body guard to super cuts employees ? i won't be returning to super cuts and the bad thing is i have been a customer since i was a young child.
"the young lady that had done my hair  twice is perfect. i cant remember her name ( it starts with an  r ) but she has been perfect , i am an unconventional woman (( not the usual just a trim person and wear my hair in a flattop ) and she listens and does exactly what i wanted even doing a couple of design lines in the back . could not ask for better !!!"
went with my husband. first stylist said she didn't know how to cut a flat top. we said we'd wait because three other stylists were there. after waiting 25 minutes one stylist took someone who came in after we did (he'd called for an appt so that's fine) but the other two went to lunch without saying a word. just disappeared. so we left. amazingly poor service. won't be back.
they did better than the barber shop on lackland afb but not the best haircut my husband has gotten.
"1st time coming here, i needed 2 haircuts for my children came in without an appt.  and they took them super fast. definitely coming back again, great  and friendly customer service."
"since when does it take two ladies to go talk about high lights costs and different colors. to make it worse both ladies left their stations to talk. errrrrrr. oh well, hair cut ended up ok but i do think they need more stylist."
"i've been here a few times for myself and son. all times we were taken care of right away and our haircuts have always been on-point. the ladies are very sweet and after sitting there for a few hours having color done, i noticed a lot of regulars come through which was very nice to see."
"i came in and was told there were 2 people in front of me.  there were two people waiting, so ok.  i understand that people check in online, but 4 people later i was still sitting there.  i get it, people have their regulars, but at least have the courtesy to acknowledge the customer still waiting as people after them are checking in and seen before them."
"went and got highlights and it took about 2 hours. all the girls there were very professional and my hair came out great. i noticed that the store is very clean, cleaner than i have seen anywhere else. i noticed all the stylist were pretty fast, most of them told me hello while i was ""cooking"" as they called it. so basically it was a fun to group of girls who managed to interact with everyone. later on in the day i took my 4 year old son to get a zero fade and it came out excellent. defiantly a family environment. i will most defiantly be back. tuesday they have $10 haircuts."
"the only person i go to is rosalina. she does a good job, so far my experience is the people are quite friendly."
one person ahead of me. waited over an hour to get service. the ladies on the weekend are super slow. never had bad service here before. however note dont come on sunday.
"i will never go to another super cuts again. the people that worked there were rude to another customer, did not know how to cut hair. i know i was in trouble when i told them to cut my son hair medium fade 0 on the side and a 2 on top. and the lady said do i want to keep the sideburns.  lol did not know how to do a fade and another women had to finish it. my bad experience."
"they did a decent job on my daughters hair, shaped it to frame her face, facility was clean and close to my house for a quick trim it works but i didn't like is that i waited 30 minutes after my appointment time."
"sitting here waiting for 45 minutes, 2 hairstylists cutting hair, and many more keep popping from the back, just look out and go back to their little room in the back. wait is ridiculous, only reason i stopped here, again, is to give them a second chance from previous times months ago, again, same service. slow, and girls here seem to hate their job. for sure not giving them a 3rd chance."
i'm usually skeptical to go to places like this for a haircut because i'm super picky and sometimes i don't want to splurge for a simple haircut/ trim.  my friend recommended me to stop by here and ask for mary and omg every time i go i am  always satisfied!!! i can show mary a picture of what i'm aiming for and she always gives her honest opinion before she cuts my hair and that's what a good stylist should do! please please try it out and ask for mary she's the best you won't regret it!
best hair cut i've had in many years. come by and see mary i promise you won't be disappointed.
the skills of the stylists is average yet no one seems like they actually enjoy working here. it's frustrating to be told you're next on the list and then 5 people get called before you. their explanation was that other people had checked in online or called ahead but shouldn't that have been mentioned when we initially checked in? i'm fine with waiting as long as i have a good idea of how long i'll actually be waiting for.
supercuts does a fine job of cutting my hair. then again i have a very simple hairstyle. if you're looking for inexpensive salon treatment for your coiffure then i would give supercuts a minute. my biggest complaint is that they always leave too many cut hairs on my head and down the back of my neck and shirt. this happens not only at this location but every supercuts i have been to. immediately after getting a haircut i always go to the bathroom and wet my hands and run them through my head to remove all the little hairs. i don't know if this is due to improper training or desire to sell you a shampoo and rinse but this is not acceptable.
i visited this location when i was out of my state for a wedding. the place is nice clean and efficient. they're realistic on wait time and everyone greats you. it was my 1st time going there and i need a updo for a wedding. sarah jane ( i believe that was her name) who actually did my hair was nice and friendly. she kept making sure she wasn't being to rough with my head. i didn't know exactly how i wanted my hair i suggested somethings to her and showed her the dress i was going to wear. she did a fantastic job.
"apparently the solution for a cowlick here is to cut it super short... despite the hair around it being about 2-3 inches long. i am not too picky about my hair. first, because i still have a decent head of hair and that makes me happy. second, it grows back. but when a stylist is as lazy or incompetent as to simply cut the cowlick extra short in hopes that addresses the issue i get a little upset. what makes the matter worse is when i noticed the hair on the back of my head was longer than other parts i asked her ""why is not even with the front?"" and she told me ""because i don't want the cowlick to stand up."" i did not notice the botched job she did until i got home and was extra mad because not only did she cut the cowlick extra short, she used the cowlick as an excuse for keeping the hair uneven on top my head! avoid this place! there are plenty of others within the couple miles."
"haircuts are quick and usually decent, though quality can vary by stylist. my kids get great cuts here. i don't like to have my own done here, though, as nobody seems to be able to cut decent layers. i did get my bangs trimmed today while my son got a haircut, and while i was happy with my bangs, i was pretty disappointed with the experience. my stylist asked if i wanted a haircut too and i declined. she talked me into a half-inch trim, which she completed in under 5 minutes on my completely dry hair--didn't spritz it with water, let alone wash it--then charged me for a full haircut. i thought it was odd she didn't even wet it down, but then thought maybe she was being nice and still considering it a bang trim--nope. won't make that mistake again--or go back to this location."
"for starters, i love this supercuts! i've been coming here for several years and have never left unhappy!! i recently got my hair dyed and my hair definitely took to the the color and it came out way too dark. i was so unhappy with the color. not anyone's fault, just wrong selection of color done by us. ‍ well i came in today and emma was so helpful and patient when trying to fix my color. she worked so diligently to make sure i left happy but also to keep my hair healthy. it was trial and error, but i'm so happy with how my hair turned out! i had to hug her at the end! definitely recommend this supercuts and emma!"
"i'm not one to write reviews, i actually created an account specifically to write how horrible this location is.hands down worst haircut i have had done. the girl had no idea what she was doing. she attempted to tell me she was done, i had to point out the obvious patches of hair she left. i would've asked her to fix it but i was worried she would leave me nothing to fix if she made it worse. i asked for gel and instead of her styling my hair i had to do it myself because let me quote her, ""my fingers are stubby"". if you can't apply gel to someone's hair you probably shouldn't be cutting it to begin with.there was another employee kissing her partner which was very unprofessional.i've gone to supercuts for awhile and this is by far the worst location and experience i've had. if i could give it zero stars i would.avoid if you like your hair!"
"i usually like going here, but the last time i went the lady who cut my hair seemed to be in a huge rush even though there was no one else waiting.just chopped at my hair with scissors with almost no attempt at making look like i didn't just grab scissors and do it myself"
"i checked in online, drove over there only to find they were closed at 5:45 pm on a monday night to film a commercial. perhaps you shouldn't take reservations if you're closed. perhaps you should change your website to reflect your random closings. thanks for wasting my time. if you can't do the simple things right, you can't be trusted with anything."
the best bang for your buck !!!!!great hair style and friendly atmosphere.
"dee is my favorite.the ladies in here are always having a good time and atmosphere here is alway lively i've had 3 - 4 great hair cuts hereask them to go hard on you during the hair rinse,      you'll thank me later."
i have been coming to this location for well over 7 years! lenzy is by far the best! you may walk in as just a client but you leave knowing your part of the supercuts family! all the others ladies are friendly! love this place!!!!!
"wow! i have been coming here for over two years now and this place has always exceeded my expectations. the ladies are friendly, welcoming, and professional. you can tell they love their job. i have been going to lyndsey the longest. she is amazing as well as dee! the prices cannot be beat and the wait time is not long. i've never had any complaints. i highly recommend. i will be back soon!"
they did a sloppy haircut on me and my dad. the people were rude and i do not recommend this place.
the girl with pink hair named kayla cut my brothers hair who is very specific with the way he wants his hair and she was told to just trim the sides of his head and she ended up cutting off his hair on the top of his head and left him with a very sad and ugly hair due which left my brother crying after leaving the salon. supercuts is not the place you want to go to get you're hair cut (the way you want it.) this all explains on why the place was empty and only $15.
"i came in and saw lyndsey yesterday and she did a phenomenal job on my short haircut. i tried cutting my hair myself to be short enough for work and it didn't turn out too hot. but anyway, she was incredibly professional and very kind to me. i would highly recommend and will definitely come back if i'm still staying here in town."
sarah did awesome job! she cut and style my hair perfectly. she listened my wishes and  gave me few suggestions and i end up walking out with big smile. i will def go back.
this is an update. lindsey and angie are still there and continue to do a great job. they also have dee and another young lady there who do great work as well.
"great haircut for a reasonable price.  karen is the bomb, especially if you get a shampoo, and lindsay is good, too, with her spicy personality hahaha..."
great and friendly staff! lenzy is a great stylist! dee is wonderful! you can't go wrong with either stylist!!
"dee was absolutely awesome. i had an appointment at another place a little further down the road. but, they stood me up so i went here instead. i'm really glad that i did. i will be back. thank you!!"
"i had my hair cut today by dee, she was friendly, professional and did a great job on my hair. this was the first time i visited a supercuts and am very please that i did. i will definitely return. thanks dee!"
"very good and friendly! walked in without an appointment but didn't have to wait very long to be serviced. there were two ladies working and both were very nice and welcoming. the parking is ample and the service is great. it didn't take very long for her to clean up my hair and bangs, and she also gave me recommendations for good food places! decent pricing as well. i would come back if i was back in san antonio again. thank you for the great service! keep up the great work!"
"i had a good experience here: all the ladies were nice, and payed close attention to what i had to say. i hadn't gotten a haircut for a while, but each place i went to didn't listen to what i wanted. so in other words i am very protective with my hair and who cuts it. i'm a college student, i needed somewhere cheap but does good quality cuts. i'm very happy i found this place and i will be going back more and more."
lived in sa for 6 months and went here off and on. best supercuts i've ever been too. never got a bad hair cut here and could trust all the girls there. took one star off cause i would prefer to wait an extra two minutes than to walk through and sit in a strangers hair...
"i wanted a cut that was shorter, long enough to pull up off my neck when needed, easy maintenance and still cute after a wash and go. chloe did exactly that!  love it!  i recommend chloe if you need a cut."
"not pleased. i have been here since 430 for 2 haircuts. (its now 540)boy hair cuts no less.  we were given an appt time of 445. i understand taking your time with a client. but there was an hour spent on a kid (about 14)who had been left here and mom gave no direction on what needed to happen. almost done  with his hair and here comes big brother. mom wants it short. so now we have to call mom and get direction that should have been given before hand. to say i am not pleased is an understatement. i only came here bc their regular barber was closed. i am in dire straits. it won't happen again. and this girl had better be as meticulous with my son's hair as she was with the kid before him.well, she didn't. she offered me $5 off. as i was trying not to allow my anger get the best of me,her manager stepped in and comped the haircut.thoroughly disappointed in how the stylist handled or was going to handle the situation. she was a bit confrontational with me and i not been weak with hunger at this point she would have seen a side of me i save for very few."
"this supercuts is one of the highest rated in san diego. i was fortunate enough to be in the area and the app wait time stated zero minutes waiting.  i came at the right time apparently, as soon i was getting my hair cut the place got swamped with a 2 hour wait time. seems like alicia is the store rockstar ( and apparently the store manger to boot). there are many reviews calling her out by name as their preferred stylist. i can totally agree with the praise. she was fast and precise and this may have been the best ever supercut that i've ever had. a striking difference from my last visit to the mission valley sc where that was a terrible cut. there was also something else about all of the stylists here. they looked like stylists from a fancy salon, not from supercuts or sports clips. you don't have to worry about having someone that looks like your mom giving you a haircut here...- wednesday, thursday, early, but never come here on a saturday. - ask for alicia...."
"asked for a fade using clippers on the back and sides, but the hair stylist stated she was not comfortable blending with clippers (!), and instead used scissors and spent about 20 minutes doing it by hand. the end result was this weird choppy look that i definitely did not ask for."
"i hate to give this awesome review simply because i don't want my stylist to get too busy and make it difficult for me to schedule with her. however, she deserves a great review. i always get a 1 or 1.5 cut on the sides and back and most stylists don't take the time to run the clippers long enough to make sure every hair is cut evenly. alicia (manager) does take that extra step and makes sure every thing is to my liking. i've been to many barbershops and i can never get the cut i want at an affordable price. alicia is the best!the facilities and clean and the rest of the staff is also nice. it certainly makes it easier to schedule with the supercuts app now that it works properly."
"i came here originally to get a botched haircut fixed (my own doing) and alexis came to the rescue. everyone at this location was and continues to be helpful, accommodating and kind. i now go to alexis for my bang trims, haircuts, blowouts and i now buy my shampoo and conditioner here. this place is the real deal. great service. great prices."
"so bummed out! my daughter came here for a color fix and explained exactly what we were looking for. long story short and 2 1/2 hours later, she walked out with the front of her hair being white with violet in the front that i ended up having to go to the grocery store to buy hair color to put foils in my own to fix her before pictures. i was very clear to her and the other she asked to his sister, that i was unhappy and that she needed to fix it. she even had the guts to charge me $85 for the mess. i was just sick. beware when people sound like they know what they're talking about. if you need a color job .go somewhere else"
"i love this place. i've been going here exclusively since they opened and have had nothing but excellent service and even better haircuts. roxy is my go to stylist and has been for quite some time now. she's always happy and does an amazing job. she's friendly and really cares for her clients. her tea tree treatments are extremely relaxing and totally worth the extra price. i wouldn't think that getting a haircut would be something i'd ever say i look forward to but i love going to the supercuts in poway!if you don't want to wait, make an appointment over the phone or use the app! it's easy and super helpful."
"moved back to the area last year and usually stop by here on a whim once every month or two to get my hair shaved down to a number 1 length mainly for ease of waking up at 0400 everyday and considering i usually wear a hat. stopped by here today and was able to call ahead on my way home which was very convenient, but also had a great experience. alicia was very inventive with my bi-monthly head shaving when it came to fading my beard and shaping the back of my head. who knew you could have both squared and rounded at the same time! **mind...blown...** additionally, i got a legit beard massage which i would never have thought to be a thing until today. the beard oil she used was also on point! glad to have moved close-by to a legit supercuts! will definitely keep this as my regular place!"
"i've been coming to this location for approximately 2 years because anna gives me a fantastic cut every time. lately though, i feel like it might be time to look elsewhere. there is no receptionist at the salon and the stylists have to stop what they are doing to answer the phone, greet customers and check them in. anna even had to stop cutting my hair to assist the at&t tech who was there working on the salon's internet (while i sat in the chair for 10 minutes waiting with a quickly drying head of hair) the result? a crappy, poorly shaped cut. as i said, i've been going there for 2 years and this is not a new situation, there has never been a receptionist and the stylists have always had to stop their work to attend to others, but it's always annoyed me and just felt like it is beyond time to say so. anna is not to blame, she's always professional, apologetic, and does great work so i hope the powers that be actually read these reviews and consider properly staffing their salon. it's not fair to paying customers and it's not fair to the hard-working gals that work there. quit being cheap supercuts!"
very rude staff. i made an appointment and when i showed up they told me two people were still in front of me. i asked why did i make an appointment if i can't be seen at that time. they told me they were running behind. i responded with asking how long it would take to wait and they couldn't give me a direct wait time and laughed at me while i asked questions. i made an appointment so i wouldn't have to wait for 30+ minutes. as someone who is in this industry myself it would behoove your company to not treat your clients this way. if you're running late do your client the decency to call and let them know. i drove all the way out to this salon for nothing. i will not go to a supercuts again if this is how they run their business.
"$19 for basic trim$4 for shampoo45 min-1 hr wait for 1 person @ 3:30pm on a friday???? (only one stylist on the floor). there were two people waiting ahead on me and i watched as 4 people walked in and then left, after they heard that the wait was 45 minutes. one of the most ridiculous parts about the wait is that there was another stylist there, but instead of cutting hair she was putting price stickers on merchandise. huh???!the only 2 reasons why i wound up staying here was bc 1) it was the closest place to my house (the next closest place is wendy's hair and design & they charge an insane $55 for a basic trim...wait, huh??? does it come with anal bleaching or something??). 2) i got very little sleep last night so i didn't feel like driving further."
"been here about 8 times now and never had a bad haircut.  roxy is great but also used a couple of the other girls.  there is a good vibe in there, no awkwardness or insincere conversation."
my first time here. i'm super happy with my haircut. roxy did a great job! make sure to make an appointment since there's always long waiting list.
alicia is amazing!! i'm so happy i stumbled in here and got her!! she took her time and cut my hair to perfection!! i will for sure go back to her every time! i love my hair and i'm sooo happy i met her! thank you alicia!!
"first let me start by saying that i am really happy with my hair cut done by savana, however, the color experience was awful! i have completely white hair as i am prematurely grey. i decided to have it colored platinum so it didn't look so stark. savana colored it. on the first attempt it came out rusty white with a pink hue. the second attempt turned my hair a light aluminum shade. she said that the color wouldnt take because my hair lacked pigment. i just stated that i wanted some warmth added to my already white hair...so .....on the third attempt she put ""gold "" in it and it came out burnt orange. ....then i just gave up!...my co-workers said it looked like a golden lemur or a golden retriever. so to make a long story short don't ever have your hair colored there. i suspect that the stylist there lack experience with color."
"i always get nervous trying to find a new place to get my haircut since having just moved back to san diego. i work close by this supercuts and thought i'd give it a try and alicia did a great job. turns out she's the general manager for this location as well as a few other locations, murphy canyon and i think escondido. naturally she did a great job being the gm, i suppose one would expect nothing less but there are those managers out there... anyway, we had a great conversation while she was working on my hair and she did not thankfully, forget that she was cutting my hair because of the conversation.i also noticed that she did a great job overseeing the shop in general, the other stylists (but not micromanaging) and tending to the customers who walked in.i was impressed because on two occasions she specifically remembered details about other customer's cuts and preferences. one guy who walked in, she passed him on to another stylist because she was busy with me and she told the stylist exactly how the gentleman liked his haircut and believe me, it was not just a generic instruction. props to alicia, i hope to have the same experience each time i go in to your shop, especially when you are not there. you seemed to run your businesses very well and have a great rapport with your stylists and customers, so i imagine it to be the case. then will come the 5th star"
alicia did an amazing job on my haircut. i went from a boring just below the shoulders haircut to a perfectly layered and cute cut above the shoulders. it's couldn't have turned out better. i'll be back for sure!
"roxy! yes that is the only word you need to know. .aka roxanne makes me really look forward to a haircut. i have been seeing roxy for about a year now and every time i can count on a good cut. she is fun and friendly, precise and efficient. i love the way the online appointment works, it's very convenient and alleviates any wait time."
so i was that person tonight. you know the one that comes in 15 minutes before closing and needing a haircut. now i am not talking about a trim. i needed a good 5-6 inches cut off. i have been wanting a new style for awhile now and i finally picked one and i felt brave enough to go in and get it done. savana and becki were super helpful and nice to to get me in a chair and get started with a wash and cut. she took her time and made sure the style was exactly what i wanted. i have been a customer for 10+ years now and this is exactly why i will always go to supercuts and no where else. i am super happy with my new haircut. thank you so so so much savana and becki! i really appreciate everything you did for me tonight.
"lil sarah washed, cut, and styled my hair.  i was so impressed with her professionalism and positive attitude.  i enjoy going in to see her and always love the way she does my hair.  she is the best!"
truly enjoyed having my son's hair cut here. new stylist named kimberly works here now and does a great job. i appreciated there is finally a stylist who cuts hair like a professional. i will be coming back and having his hair cut by her. thank you kimberly!
"marie did a good job , i think she is one of the best men's hair stylist i ever tried she is very detailed and will not rush you out."
"i usually go to supercuts for basic upkeep haircuts (trims, thinning out). went to this location for a shampoo, trim, thinning. i was the only customer in the store during my entire visit. my hairdresser was stephanie. after shampooing she combed through my hair and while i do have fairly long thick hair, i've never had as painful/complicated of an experience brushing it as i did here. i figured it was just a bad hair day for me and dealt with it. the haircut seemed to go fine, fairly quickly, and felt nice and light when i was done. looked ok in the mirror, while still wet. after my visit i threw my hair into a bun, headed to class, and didn't really do anything with it until the next day. when i dried and straightened it my boyfriend (who doesn't usually notice haircuts) said , oh my gosh what happened to your hair?   why you ask?!this was due to the fact that not only was there much more visibly gone than the inch i had discussed, but there were chunks of my hair cut at completely different lengths. my bangs (previously swooped to the side) were chopped bluntly but a chunk was missed. the two sides did not match up length wise. there are chunks within my hair (i.e, behind my ear, bottom layer) that should be the longest layer , that are now only about three inches long (my hair goes past my shoulders!!).  when i put my hair in a ponytail now, random pieces won't stay up. i can't wear my hair half up because of the super short areas in the middle layers. and wearing my hair all down and straight poses the same issue.  after working so hard to grow my hair out, i am not sure whether to laugh or cry, at this time i've done  both.  i considered returning to see if a manager could help fix my hair, but i decided i don't want anyone there to touch it again. i could have done a more even cut backwards in my mirror. so disappointed in this experience, not sure how that lady is allowed to touch peoples hair.  :( **in the photos please excuse my un made up face .  i also included 2 before photos-- this was supposed to be a one inch trim"
i got a really awesome hair cut from rose at this supercuts the other day. she understood exactly what i wanted and was able to do it flawlessly. i will definitely go back to her.
"i will continue to go see janet she is very nice and do a good job, love the location as well if i you wanna go out after you're hair is done across the street is the utc mall."
kelly was awesome! she gave me exactly what i was looking for and also advised me on what would look really great on me. i took her advise and i absolutely love my new hair cut!! definitely recommend her!
"i'm super impressed by this supercuts! i came in and was greeted promptly and kindly. kelly, the hair artist, was incredible at listening to what i wanted done, combining the different elements (keep it long, add layers,make it v shaped in the back), and keeping good conversation =)i would def recommend this supercuts! even if your hesitant like i was at first, you won't be sorry ^_^"
"want to get a decent haircut without the salon prices ?head on over to supercuts ! it can be a gamble, but if you like taking risks, this will do !i've been to a few other supercuts locations and surprisingly have been happy with the results. no major traumatic experiences. knock on wood. figured i'd give this place a shot since i was getting my car serviced nearby and needed to kill time. yes..why not get a haircut ? summer is here ! time for a change ! located at a small outdoor shopping center with nearby restaurants/nail salon/small businesses.as i walked in on a friday afternoon, i was immediately greeted. there was one other customer ahead of me, so the wait was short. they gathered my information to input in their system and asked for the type of service i wanted: shampoo, cut, and blow dry - the basicsmy hairstylist, shari asked for what type of cut i wanted. she made sure i was specific with what i wanted which i appreciated. i hate when hairstylists assume and jack up your haircut and don't do anything to fix the problem. anyway, shari was quite the opposite. she was fast, efficient, and very conversational. i felt very comfortable with her. she took 3 inches off and added some layers. it's medium-length which i prefer for my frame. she did exactly what i wanted.in addition, she wanted to know the types of products i used for my hair and to get a history of my haircare routine. she was open to hearing me out and gave me great recommendations.i purchased a couple products that she used on my hair: paul mitchell awapuhi shampoo and conditioner  - love the scent ! no pressure to sell either. overall, i'm very satisfied with the whole experience ! i wouldn't mind coming back if i was in the area.supercuts is really stepping it up and hiring well-qualified hairstylists ! thanks for not burning a hole in my wallet !"
"super frustrated! this weekend i took my son to get his haircut first and last time here! the poor girl was confused about who the next client was even when the other person told her several times my son was next. the name rc seriously confused them. he got a ok haircut she was nice and tired. i was told it was $15, i tipped $2 no problem or so i thought! i check my account and no i was charged $32! i call to ask how much a haircut is the girl says $23 i tell her i was told $15 she says well on tuesday's it's $14. i informed her i was told it was $15. she says oh yes maybe. i tell her i was charged $32 she says that i (me the customer!) made a mistake. i ask what do you mean i made a mistake it was $15 i tipped $2 she says oh yes you must've made a mistake when you tipped. i was pissed now! i told her i'm not stupid! i paid $15 for the haircut i tipped $2 that makes $17 not $32! she insists that it was my error and that i should not be upset. i told her really i shouldn't be upset you guys charged me more than what i approved and i shouldn't be upset?! she tells me to come with my receipt and they'll fix it. i tell her i don't have a receipt she says just come with my card and hung up. fuming i get there telling them i'm there for my refund. she tells me i don't need my card the girl left the money in a envelope then says because i tipped the machine thought i wanted to tip $17 but the girl left my over payment for me. i was too pissed for words but i couldn't just leave i told her very loud to make sure all of them heard in the future you don't tell the customer their wrong and don't have attitude because that's what pissed me off! if you go there you better pay cash if not watch you credit/atm cards they are i'm sure scamming people!"
i came in because my normal barber couldn't take me and needed a haircut today. i asked the lady for a shadow fade and she had no idea what i was talking about. i asked for a light trim than and to clean up around my neck and ears. she couldn't not even give me a straight line in the back. it is even noticeable from a distance how uneven the back of my hair is. i gave up and told her i was done just so i can go home and fix it myself. go somewhere else. you were warned
"called before coming in, an hour before closing, and got turned away when we got there 10 minutes after calling. plenty of people inside the salon but they locked their doors on us when we got there."
"polly is my hairstylist she is damm good at work. she understand what i exactly looking for and gave me a new styling look. thanks to ""polly"" again."
"this review is about chelsea. first of all, i understand the risk of going to a place such as supercuts, however i do not understand how someone so incompetent can work there. i got a haircut there yesterday and asked specifically for a shorter haircut with not too many layers, a very simple and easily completed style-or so i thought. what i walked out with was nothing short of horrifying. the top layer is so short and thick its like a bowl cut around my head. i cannot believe that not only did she not listen to me at all, she also did not well execute the haircut she thought i should have. since i'm out of hair, there is no way to fix it and instead i am using my own money to buy extensions, and heavily relying on a half up do. i would like to see supercuts make some sort of effort to remedy the situation (free product, etc), since now i am basically sol."
my boyfriend joe told me that sarah cut his hair one time months ago and that he liked the way she did it... hope i can get to meet her to see what can she do with my hair because is very thin... maybe i would drop by soon
"i took my son here to trim his hair for school. i specifically told the girl, leave his hair long. and explained in detail how he is very attached to his hair. having only cut it by a barber one other time. i usually cut it.she completely hacked his hair. only leaving the front longer because i asked her to stop cutting. he left in tears because of her inability to understand what the customer asked for.will never return here."
"i love the supercuts at genesee. everyone is extremely accommodating and talented. i'm always greeted with a smile and my overall experience is great. i would like to give a shout out to kelly, who is my go to hair stylist. she is a magician. she knows exactly how i want my hair to be done and always delivers the perfect haircut. thank you kelly for everything you do. i really appreciate it! because of kelly, i keep coming to supercuts at genesee again and again, and will continue to do so!!"
"i spent a few days looking at reviews in the clairemont mesa/kearny mesa for a hair salon that did good work, but was also affordable as i only get my hair trimmed and did not wish to pay $50+ to have my split ends cut and a few layers added. i came across sarah from supercuts on yelp and saw she had really great reviews and took a chance and called up supercuts and asked for sarah. i called an hour before to see when they could take me in and was told to come on over. i was greeted, remembered from my call, and immediately taken to a chair. all i knew was that i wanted long, face-framing layers and to take 2-3"" of dead ends. as i was sitting in the chair, sarah took my vague requests and channeled them into specific, direct actions and really explained to me how certain layers would look in comparison to what i desired and divulged knowledge and expertise to help me achieve the results i wanted. she even offered a certain type of layer that i had never heard of and i could just tell she was trying to help me get the trim and layering i desired. sarah executed trimming my hair and adding layers exactly how i requested. i trusted sarah according to her reviews and her performance did not disappoint. i will continue to see sarah because i know she will use her knowledge and expertise to help me achieve my goals of healthy hair."
"i love coming here! i have an autistic son named mason. his stylist kelly is so great. she talks with him, and  is very patient and sweet! 5 stars all the way! thank you kelly"
poor costumer service. when i walked in there was only one costumer and two employees. for some reason both of the employees were attending the same person. i waited for 5 minutes until one of the two ladies decided to attend me.
last week i took my daughter in for a haircut and it had definitely been a long time (my daughter wanted to try the long hair thing). she's ten and was very sure of what she wanted! kathleen was who did her cut and not only was she nice and friendly she made my daughter feel so happy! even a week later she's still talking about her haircut experience and beautiful new do! we will definitely return and hope to see kathleen again!
"went to get a haircut and she did not know how to give a fade... i asked for a high fade and she kept asking ""are you sure that's what you want?""  i kept saying yes..  she did not blend the sides, so it looks like i have fluffed feathers now. you're supposed to blend the sides so it looks natural.. didnt even bother, she just rushed me.  i went there cause i didnt want to drive 20 minutes to my regular barber ""who is 12 dollars cheaper"" and cuts hair much better without questioning me.  not to mention pointing at my hair and laughing with another barber.  i will never go to a supercuts again.  do these barbers have any knowledge on cutting hair?  i didnt think a fade would be that difficult ."
"we tried to give opportunities to solve my 3 yr old son's first haircut debacle but it was just a mess. bad haircut, no communication or fun for him.   he's such a sweet little guy and the girl took no opportunities to engage, at all.   i would avoid for kids if you expect any personality combined with quality hair cutting.  on a relaxing sunday midday, minimal customers, we specifically asked for someone with experience and good at first hair cuts.  we got the ""oh well all do that"" and it seemed like it was probably just a coin flip and whoever lost got the job. the girl maybe said 5 words to our son.  our son was super chill and did exactly what he was told.  but she never asked his name or anything at all about him, it was just ""look down"".... and "" is that good.?"" and it wasn't.  then the clippers came out and buzz fast and uneven...  very disappointing.  we called back and got apology from manager, took him back when manager was there and she fixed the haircut but didn't really care to satisfy the unhappiness that we wasted our first experience with his hair on them.  they didn't offer to refund us or offer a free next hair cut as we have ""two boys under 8""... a lot of future hair to cut.  you'd think future business would be something they would value but they seemed happy with fixing the mess and having me sign away liability by abmitting my minimal satisfaction.   had the girl been hospitable and done a bad job, or had an amazing haircut and been boring.... maybe it would he something to let go, but both awful and the manager cured the haircut but it was clear our business was not cared for.  unfortunate but there seems to be some good spots for kids, so we will seek some referrals instead."
fantastic servicei stopped in for a hair cut last week and got brianna bishop and she was fantastic!!!! friendly and bubbly personality she made the time go by fast and made me smile
i love this place so much and my favorite hairstylist to go to is estella she's the best. she always does wonders to my hair. as long as she's still there i will always come back. she's a sweet girl. thanks estella
"i've been to so many supercuts, and found the best hairstylist for me....cecily! she understood exactly what i wanted, and it looks great....therefore i'm happy!! i've bought so many hair products as well. she recommended d:struct and i'm lovin that. cecily is also super nice too! thanks!"
worst haircut ever!! do not see stella... she has absolutely no clue on how to cut hair.. and when hearing how upset i was - the rest of the staff gave a looks as though that was the norm... not surprised at my frustration...asked for the closest barber and they gladly gave me it.. manager griselda just stood there like nothing going on... worst place ever
i got my hair colored and cut from manager griselda! she is soooo wonderful! she had me looking fabulous! she always does a great job that's why i go back to her every time! and she's so nice and makes it a really enjoyable experience! i got so many people i work with saying ur hair looks fabulous and makes u look younger! how great is that!
super cuts is the best place to get your hair cut. the hair stylist are friendly and do a great job on cutting your hair the way you want it. i've been back three times and have been satisfied each time. i recommend supercuts to anyone who needs a haircut.
got a haircut.  it's bad.  looked fine day of but it's growing in horribly.  bad place for haircuts based on my haircut.
"i made an appointment and i had a $3.00 off coupon , they wouldn't take it because it was for a different super cuts. i chose not to stay and went to the super cuts on el cajon. they were very willing to accept a coupon from a different store.it's amazing to think that a place of business would be willing to lose a customer over $3.00.bad customer service. i won't be going back."
"i came in an hour before they closed for a haircut. wait time was average, but they have seats and recent magazines, so all is well there.i do have to give a shout-out to the hairdressers, though. more than one person came in at the last minute asking for a haircut. when told that no more appointments were being accepted (as i wasn't the only one waiting, it was obvious there was a wait), these people became visibly frustrated; one man was verbally frustrated and said the manager had told him he could come in right until closing. when they said it wasn't policy, he slammed out of there saying loudly and angrily: ""i'll never come back.""at no time was anyone in the business mean or insulting, merely apologetic. not even after the guy slammed out. props to them."
"if you go in for a cut, ask for cecily! she's the best stylist we've had here. my brother and husband both go to her. she's sweet, comforting and detail oriented. all good things when looking for a stylist :)"
i really enjoyed my visit to supercuts. griselda really took her time and did a wonderful job. my hair grows in all kinds of crazy directions and can be difficult to cut but she did wonderfully. thanks again.
"being new to san diego and having no barber, i thought i'd keep it conservative and go with my safe, reliable choice, supercuts. i was very pleased. cecily was wonderful. terrific job on my hair and beard plus a good conversationalist. i'm only here for a few more months, but, for as long as i'm here, getting a great haircut is one thing i don't have to think about."
"the people here are often nice, but the girl who cut my hair was just getting lazy with it. i asked for long side bangs and told her exactly what i wanted and she proceeded to quickly part my hair the way i told her not to in the weirdest way, grab a chunk of my hair, and slide her scissors through it literally as scissors would slide when cutting wrapping paper in a matter of 5 seconds. i'm a very timid and non confrontational person so i just didn't say anything because what's done was done, but they are way shorter than i asked and after leaving, parting my hair the right way, and looking in the mirror i realized that they look so terrible. it's been about a month and a half and they haven't grown back at all and they're way too short to do anything with. the girl with the dark pixie/bob cut was the one who cut it and i'm just so over trying to style my impossible hair. it also only took about 1 minute and a half for the whole haircut (minus the shampooing) and i had to pay $25. after, i went up to the counter and she tried to sell me expensive tea tree shampoo and told me that was what she washed my hair with when i clearly saw her wash it with the paul mitchell shampoo. i'm sad because i have gone here a few times and never had any issues with the other ladies."
fantastic haircut and service from mercedes! she took the time to get it right.
"watch out for shady business.  griselda sold my 93 year old father, who has dementia, a 2 oz product that he can't use for $21 and then took a $25 tip.  so his $21 hair cut cost him $67.  i called to complain and she was very rude and dismissive.  she had no remorse for taking advantage of him.  shameful!!!"
"i really have to give a shout out to griselda for her eyebrow waxes. i have some strong caterpillar eyebrows that i like to have a very specific shape, and she has been 100% on the mark every time i've gone to her. with hair cuts, i went to this location and got a sub par cut from another stylist and when i went back, specifically to griselda, she identified it and fixed the cut, and did a great job doing it. people don't often associate supercuts with waxing (i frequently get asked ""supercuts does waxing!?"") but i am so incredibly satisfied with griselda's work, and with her knowledge of current styles and her skill with my hair."
"i came with my girlfriend here today and she came to get a haircut and signed herself in, nothing out the ordinary, this was our second time and our first time being a very pleasant visit . as we sit in the store, this lady comes in and request to get a haircut and the hairstylist told her a 20 to 30 min and the lady literally said she didn't have time cause she has work. i really thought the stylist would tell her sorry or something like that but literally they put her next. what is that ? we were waiting patiently. so i guess now you can just barge in and say you can't wait that long and you'll be next. you guys should really put this people to the side and make them wait how we did. this experience was underwhelming. it's honestly those people's fault for running late. they should plan accordingly on the things they do rather then barging in like that and not taking inconsideration on the people that sign in and wait."
"all of the staff members at this super cuts location are super friendly. because the wait can be a while, i recommend checking in online especially if you decide to take advantage of the super tuesday $16 haircuts (regular $21) since is gets busier that day. i highly recommend requesting briana. she does an excellent job and has a very warm personality."
this place has been my go to place for haircut. usually chill folks in there with price expected results.  they have a new front desk gal with fiery red hair and exotic appearance who needs to learn how to smile!! talk about a rbf!
"this happened a while ago but i just started reviewing. i went in as a walk-in to get a haircut. they took my name down and i waited in the seated area. other people came in and i noticed they went before me. i thought maybe they had an appointment and i was a walk-in so that was understandable. then i noticed everyone was going before me. i waited about an hour when originally it was stated it would be fifteen minutes. finally, someone came up to me and asked if i had  given my name when i walked in. i said yes and they looked and it wasn't in there. she told me that they lost my name somehow in the system. then even though she just notified me that they lost my name, she took a newer customer and said i'd be next. why would you not just do me next?? what horrible customer service! but she said i'd get a 15% discount. another woman, possibly the manager, came up to me and said i'd get it for free. never went back after."
"sarah is fantastic! i promise that you definitely will be supper happy with your haircut. she also has such a great personality and she won't let you mess you hair up even if you insist lol. trust me, i am talking from experience. lol ... on a serious note, if you are going there for the first time and you are not sure who to ask for, ask for sarah and you will be in safe hands."
i've been coming to this place ever since! the stylists are really great and attentive to your needs.
"i see michelle! i can count with one hand the people i trust to cut my hair. i wish i could say how long she's been cutting my hair, more than a decade ago since she was in the north park location.i like the no fuss approach to haircuts. i don't want to stay for hours with a wash, cut and then blow dry. (don't get me wrong she will blow dry your hair if you want her to) i personally, just don't have time for that. michelle is super skilled, accurate and always professional and polite. thank you!"
i've gone to michelle 3x for a cut and color and she is amazing! best hair cut i've had in sd and love my color. i will definitely go back.
"i received a fantastic haircut from marcia at the hillcrest location. she was incredibly detailed and the results were amazing. she was also very nice to talk too. i feel great, thanks marica."
"so i found my new stylist.  nicole takes her time and gives great suggestions for my hair style.  i had a color and a cut and love them both.  i have had issues in the past with stylist pulling on my hair which was painful since i do have a sensitive scalp.  nicole is gentle almost to the point where i am so relaxed i could fall asleep. she also gave me the best scalp massage when she was shampooing my hair.  if you want a ""spa like"" experience ask for nicole."
"this store has absolutely horrible customer service, i will never go there again. i got to the store and they had 2 stylists working and 1 person waiting, so i waited. when the stylist were done they took the person who was waiting before me. his cut was quick, maybe 10 minutes. both stylists were done and went in the back and 2 other stylists had also come in. i sat waiting patiently, but they all went in the back like i wasn't there. and one stylist was setting up his station and i asked what was going on, he said he'd ask them in the back...i left, what a waste of time."
"i went to nicole for a haircut and coloring for my wedding.  she did a phenomenal job of cutting my hair.  she was very detailed and took her time.  she made sure to check in with me to make sure i liked it and even went back in a couple times for small changes.  the coloring turned out great too.  some bleeding, but i don't think that is her fault."
"it didn't suck and i was pleasantly surprised.  came here with my friend bobby that wanted to get a quick haircut, he was thinking about getting it buzzed but changed his mind at the last minute.   i said well damn, i need a trim let me try them out it's just hair anyway and what's an inch off anyway. i got jaime, she wasn't very friendly at first but she warmed up to me after awhile and it was okay.   sprung for the shampoo as well so with a cut at shampoo it was $22 & a $4 tip and she was pretty fast and from what i saw did a good job for a quick trim.   my mom is a hairdresser so i know what to look for and know all the tactics.  i told her my mom is a hairdresser so no need to up sale me anything since i get them for free in my care packages from her. protip:  looks like the hair stylist to request is jack martinez"
"sad:( you know the feeling , when you walk into a business and feel that the people working there would've preferred you hadn't? that's the feeling at this supercuts! no smiles, no kind ""welcome"" or ""hello"", just an awkward feeling of not being wanted! they took my name but no communication on how long it might be. there was one person waiting so i figured it probably wouldn't take too long. then 40 minutes later, person after person walked through the door and went in front of me! at this point i kinda thought they would let me know how long i had left! nope, not a word! so now i sit, already invested 45 minutes, do i stay or do i go and start over at a new place? super, not!!!!!!!"
i am the kind of person that does not go to the same stylist or make appointments. i am in a hurry and when i want a haircut i get one right then. that all changed when i started going to lokki. he does such an amazing job on my hair and also eyebrows. this is the second salon i have been to see him and i will  keep following him. he knows exactly how to cut and style my hair to make me look and feel great. besides being an amazing stylist he is so much fun to talk to! he gets five stars!
"ok, called general manager and she said they had a new manager since we were at supercuts mission hills and she said they she cut hair good and we wold like her. went back and was totally pleased. i guess at some point they ""cleaned house"" and the last person we had  problems with was no longer there along with others.the change of management could not of been better..so once again we are fans. yea!"
"never again......i went in with hair below my shoulders and i came out looking like buster brown.  i have thick wavy hair and the idiot who cut my hair did not know the difference between feathering hair and layering hair.  this person didn't even know how to cut feathered bangs.  i had to go the next day and find a salon that could cut my hair so that i didn't look like buster brown.  went down to avalon and the wonderful lady there cut my hair in 20 minutes and i love it.  supercuts is a joke, if you want your hair butchered, by all means go in there and let them do it.  all they are interested in is selling you hair products and getting their money.perhaps you should vest your employees and see if they really know how to cut all types of hair.  stay away otherwise you will be very disappointed!!!!!!!!!"
been coming for years. was sad to hear michelle richardson left to another salon but a mutual friend forwarded her facebook page so i could find her. search under her name and it comes right up.
unprofessional. i'm new to the area. disappointed. the behavior of the stylist made me feel like i'd not be returning to this particular location. oh well. live and learn.
"i don't get my hair cut that often, but love that i've discovered this great place, and especially jack! i generally keep my hair long, so he was only seeing me once a year at best and always treated me like a regular!  recently, my hair had grown so long that i decided to chop it off and donate it to beautiful locks, who make free wigs for women and girls dealing with cancer. jack was the only person i'd trust to do this! then, he created such a cute layered bob cut for me that i keep getting compliments on, that i may keep it short all summer! you'll be seeing me again soon jack!"
"the owner of this supercuts location reached out and apologized for the stylist's comments. she also offered to refund the cost of the services and set up a complimentary haircut with her location's manager. very nice and thoughtful.sadly, i felt no choice but to decline. if the services were great but the customer service was terrible - i might have considered but they weren't. yes, my haircut was good but my eyebrows were awful and the stylist was heinously rude. no going back from there.  +1 more star for the owner, still -3 for the stylist's behavior."
i've received a haircut from a few people at this location. it's a hit or miss-- but i continue to come back because it's affordable and the wait is normally not as long as other places. the overall feel of the place is clean and welcoming. the reason why i am giving them a 4 star is because of my experiences with some of their hair stylist. again-- it's a hit or miss.
"have come here a few times for a haircut. one woman does a great job, wish i knew her name but she did a great job.the two other times i've gone here, i've spent a half hour sitting in the chair while the hairdresser tries to upsell me on products.  i ended up buying one that didn't end up working well and was available for half the price online.  my advice, stop constantly upselling your customers and just give them a solid cut."
"such a great experience! they were fast, knowledgeable, and affordable. took two appointments last minute. very happy with my stylists as well."
"10 times i've made an online appointment only to be told when i arrive that the ""system"" messed up and i need to wait or reschedule. never an apology, always made to feel like it was my mistake. stupid me for continually going back for a so-so haircut, but never again."
i have had nothing but good experiences here! i highly recommend victoria and yesterday i was cut by a lady with glasses and pink hair and she was super friendly and was able to get me in & out very quickly. thank you so much!
"this was a good haircut, but i just had a regular 15 min men's hairs cut and it cost 24 dollars!! so overpriced, should've just gone to a barber shop"
"been here once most likely not coming back. the haircut was ok, the stylist was nice but it seems like the manager is always in the back so the girl who was doing my hair was also answering the phones and registering customers at the same time.she left me there at least 3 times!plus the shampoo is not included so you need to pay $5 dls extra and if you say no they tell you"" well i can't really do the haircut without a shampoo, so you don't have the choice. they need to have a receptionist so stylists can focus on their job and shampoos should be included."
"they told me it was a 45 minute wait, ok no problem. i wait over 45 minutes, it happens. i am ok with that. but my turn is up, i know because the gentleman gave the order to us, i have been waiting patiently in the store and they skip me. the employees look at each other as if they don't know what to do. they continue to sit the 2 guests that were just called in place of me. it has been an hour now and still waiting. not happy. been here once before and the haircut was good so i came back. cherry picking clients i guess, i don't know. guess i'm just not coming back.my haircut is now done. nice haircut, they gave me a complimentary shampoo, the other employee that was not one of the original 2 cut my hair and apologized and said there was a mix up after one came back from lunch."
great staff. everyone is super friendly. i've been going to ruben since i first moved down here almost 3 years ago. he always gets the job done perfectly. highly recommend!
this location is amazing. i appreciate the the customer service and the stylists abilities. they are always willing to go the extra mile to make their customers happy.thank you also for displaying the rainbow flag! that means so much.
worst haircut. hadn't been to a supercuts in years. good customer service but haircut sucked. i'll pay extra to go somewhere else. $4 to wash your hair when you butchered most of it off. how she cut the top was so amateur... it literally looks butchered. can't wait for my hair to grow back so i get someone who can actually cut hair. i think i could have done better. she seems nice so i didn't say it to her face how horrible she did. but people should know how horrible she cut my hair.
"today this particular location lost my confidence.  needing to secure cuts for both myself and my four-year-old son i loaded us up to arrive shortly after opening.  we arrived about 9:20 am on a thursday.  we parked on the street at a city meter and before unloading him i paid the maximum on the meter, simply to be safe.  he was not thrilled about getting a haircut, but i had worked on this plan all morning, making sure he understood we needed haircuts in preparation for leaving town in the next couple of days.  we walked in and saw one customer in a chair and two or three others in the waiting area.  as i approached the counter the one stylist, while cutting her client's hair, asked me if the cut was for me or for us both.  i acknowledged that we both needed cuts.  she then informed me that the wait would be more than an hour and that she was the only person there.  what the heck?!?  i can understand the occasional odd schedule with only a few stylists, but only one?  so i wasted my time, my parking money and the only opportunity to get my son and i in for cuts before leaving town.  i would appreciate any feedback from this store's ownership and/or management.  is this your current and ongoing business model?  if so, perhaps you need to simply shutter your business.  at least then i would know from the street not to bother parking.edit: in spite of my rant, i received a swift reply from ryan, indicating their 9-10 am policy.  i appreciated their attention to my concerns."
i have been getting my haircut from ruben s at this supercuts for about 3 years. he's the best and the reason i still go here! always use the app to book your haircuts and you will always know how long to wait or when to come in.
called ahead and put my name in they told me they would be ready for me in 45 minutes which worked perfectly with my schedule but when i showed up i still waited another 45minutes didn't even end up getting my hair cut because i had to be somewhere
"all i wanted was a simple mens haircut. don't bother scheduling an appointment you will wait any way. customer service was bad and in my experience.  i walked in and wasn't greeted but treated like i was an inconvenience. 1 employee was giving a haircut while 2 others were talking in the back while several people were waiting. i didn't even stick around for a haircut i left and went to fantastic sams on university, second time this place let me down. wouldn't recommend it."
"very nice employees but the wait time was rediculous. had my haircut short, for the first time in a long time & the ends weren't thinned out and blended. so went in for a redo and waited an hour after my scheduled time. unfortunately, wouldn't come back or recommend a cut from them."
i was looking for a place close to new apt for regular haircut . i stopped in here on a friday at 230.  i was treated very rudely by young hispanic female before being told it would be 45 to hr wait. both stylists were well into current haircuts and only one guy waiting. i think she just didn't feel like providing me service even though  i had done nothing to earn her nasty attitude. or she didn't feel like working. i've always received excellent service from great clips and sport clips and always tip well. i guess their competitors keep my business .
i get my haircut by ruben and every single time he does a fantastic job. it's worth it to request him to cut your hair even if you have to wait a few extra minutes.
"ruben is absolutely the best hairstylist i've ever had, and i've gone to the fanciest places in san diego in the past. he listens to what you want and is very precise! when i first started going here i was nervous that they might cut off too much hair or butcher it- (but i was on a budget at the time). and oh man, after having ruben he's the only person who has cut my hair after that for over a year. sadly my family and i are moving to sacramento now and i wanted to leave a review and say i'm so upset to not have him cutting my hair anymore!!! my hair is the healthiest and longest it's ever been thanks to him! thank you ruben!"
ruben brings back my best look every time. always worth going back to him. i've been going to him for years.
"upd; the hair was donated!we came to cut and if possible donate my 13 years old daughter's non colored hair. the hairdresser measured confirmed 8 inches and cut to the floor instead of pony tale. then swept it and told - oh , you need 11 inches to donate... i am sorry. she charged us 24 dollars. my daughter cried. and we left. i was extremely sad and disappointed. i will take it further for sure. this unacceptable. poor service. upd - the store manager chrissy was wonderful, she told the store will donate the lock of hair on julia's name. i hope she will. thank you very much."
"cristy is great! knew exactly which haircut was best for my hair type/head shape. great conversation, great cut, will definitely come again"
cristy is awesome!  really patient with everything i asked of her.  she was 2017 stylist of the year!  ask for her when you go in. she's also very experienced with hair coloring :).
"i usually stop by a supercuts every 2 months for a quick trim.this is the location nearest me, but also the one i prefer. staff appear more well organized than other supercuts locations. wait times can be quite long so call ahead for  evenings!"
"great haircuts, an super friendly staff. very nice place. it also has a great location, next to a pizza, taco, and smoothie place. five stars!"
"one hairstylist (who may be the manager...i'm not sure) is very unprofessional. in the middle of cutting my hair, she checks on an intern/apprentice to see how she is doing. additionally, she is constantly trying to sell me shampoos and conditioners when cutting my hair. i never came back here again because of this experience. someone should teach this lady that customers come first."
"just got the worst haircut of my life. asked for a simple military style medium fade with a hard part. there is no fade whatsoever, just a squiggly line going across the back of my head and the hard part is not even close to being straight. she left cut hair all over the back of my neck. didn't offer to add any product or to style it. oh, and she had some rank bo. insanely terrible experience. avoid the older woman stylist here. she has no clue on how to do a simple men's haircut. biggest waste of $26 ever. now i have to go and get another hair stylist to fix the cob job somewhere else."
"i always have a good experience coming here! my hair has never felt, looked, or laid better! all of the staff there are super friendly and just really great people. i would recommend this place to anyone who asks. seriously these guys know what they're doing and do a really great job at it!"
ask for andy. he's personable and did an excellent job cutting my hair. these haircut chains can be hit or miss and the stylists usually stay for a bit then move oni recommend andy
"flew into san diego to visit my daughter.  did not have time deal with my hair before trip.  wanted to look presentable so it was right out of the airport and into supercuts.  thanks to stylist krista for a nice haircut and a pleasant experience.  she is friendly and personable, listens well and offers good suggestions.  in a short time, i walked out with exactly the cut i wanted (and trimmed eyebrows too)."
"first off, i just want to say that my stylist was very friendly and i enjoyed her company while getting my haircut. that is the only reason why i am giving an extra star.other than that, i was extremely unimpressed with the quality of the cut itself. not only did this place increase the prices from my previous visit, this was by far the worst haircut i've ever gotten. the stylist's clippers were so bad that after her first run you could still see long hairs that were not uniform to the rest of them! she had to basically go and cut it all over again. in addition, the front of my hair was completely uneven, one side being non existent and the other being almost the same length as before i came in. around my ears were not even trimmed and i didn't even notice that because there were so many other bad things that were occupying my attention! this also took 40+ minutes while it normally takes no more than 20 and caused me to be late to pick someone up. i do not have a particularly hard head to cut and have never had such a bad result from a $22 male haircut.between this ridiculous price increase and lower quality standard there's no way i'll be back. also worth mentioning is that i normally do not post bad reviews, but this is something that really was unacceptable and based off of the other recent reviews i am not the only one who feels this way."
"great quick local haircut store and convenient location in utc area! i also get my cuts from amber, janet and cathy.. 3 great stylist ask for one of them that's on! a good little place that will check to make sure you're happy and if not they'll make it right.. the manager maggie is also very nice! been going here for 7 years!"
the stylist smelled so bad. like homeless. it was unbearable! never ever again will i visit this place. i can still smell it. unacceptable for a stylist or any other service job employee.
"i recently moved from la and i was nervous to get a haircut. danielle was awesome! she was very attentive and very funny! she was awesome! i told her how i want my haircut and she got it to every detail. my hair looks awesome because of her! she washed my hair, did my eyerbows, and lined up my sides. for $19 it was pretty awesome."
"this review is long overdue! all the stylists i've encountered at the supercut la jolla village square location are great. but i want to take the time to say thank you to jenny! i went to jenny after getting a really bad, uneven haircut elsewhere and jenny was sweet enough to fix my bad hair disaster. she even went as far as showing me new hair techniques and ways to style it. thank you jenny!"
"i've been getting my hair cut at this location for about a year and a half almost. i've gone through multiple hair stylists who came and went and overall it was a great experience. most notably right now, though, is maggie. she does my haircut the way i want it every time and she understands my long term goal of how i want my hair to grow out in a certain way. she makes great recommendations for the type of hair that i have in terms of my daily routine and the products i use. and, she does my eyebrows perfectly. better than anybody else who's ever touched them. i recommend this location for its friendly atmosphere and great hair stylists. i go once a month and every time i leave i am even more satisfied than the time before."
"$19 for a men's haircut. a little on the pricey side for me. i usually go to happy barber where it's about $10 but i got off work late and they already closed. there weren't that many people in line, however the wait still took long. nothing impressive about my haircut. lady was nice but i wouldn't come again unless i really needed a haircut and had no where to go."
"overall great cuts and good experience, but wait times could be long and staff seems stressed at times. prices are also higher than where i used to go for a cut in la, but i don't have any urges to seek elsewhere. parking is easy and the barbers are good at executing what i'm looking for and that also seems to be the case for the other people that have simultaneously had their hair cut when i have gone."
good experience with jenny. she asked all of the right questions so i could get the exact haircut i wanted. very happy.
ashley is an artist! she's been cutting my husband's hair for 3 years (?) now. she's only cut my hair twice. i went to a more expensive salon to get a fancy style but it was a little messy looking and i had ashley fix it up and now it looks perfect!i think i'll let her cut my hair from now on ;)
"i have to say the hair stylists here are top notch. every time i come, the hair stylist always caters to what i want and also provides input on how to make the haircut better. they also give input on where your cow licks are and how to style your hair if you don't know how to. furthermore, they give tips on hair products. they are very invested in you. tips:-every tuesday there are haircuts for 16 instead of 21 dollars. - if you put in your number with them, after every 8th haircut, you get the next for free. what a steal!"
"just got home from an less than pleasant experience at supercuts at costa verde shopping center. i repeatedly said that the clipper was hurting me and that something must be wrong with it but was told that it was just new and sharp.once i got home, my fiancée was shocked on how bad my neck looked as it looked like i had some kind of allergic outbreak, and it keeps on getting worse.not only does it look like i have a skin condition, but it still hurts pretty bad. i can't believe that my stylist did not mention to me that she actually had damaged my skin and played it off like it was all fine.as you can see on the attached pictures, it is not fine. this is not acceptable as i kept on saying that the clipper was really causing me pain during the session."
the worst barbershop i've ever met. their barber isn't professional at all and cut my ear while talking and laughing with others. my ear kept bleeding and no wonder they also gave me a super ugly haircut ever in my life.
"been coming to janet for the past 5 years! she is a gem. sad that i will be moving to oregon because she is irreplaceable. i always walk out with the biggest smile on my face. i get my color here and all my friends always tell me that they ""need that color too""!"
"had a wonderful experience with kayle today very professional, quick, totally understood what i wanted the first time. i walked in at a very busy time and she seemed in control of the whole shop. told me that wait will be 10-15 minutes, it was actually like 7 minutes. so glad i made the decision to just stop in today. i will be back !!!"
"tbh i don't expect to become gorgeous from here. i'm in for the affordable cut and no waiting for people who show up to their appointments late. i call, if there's a less than 30 min wait, i'm there. if not, then i go another time. $15 tuesdays and usually coupons are available online.i feel like the cuts i get on tuesdays are more rushed and careless, they don't always dry your hair or brush it when done. went on a sunday with a $5 coupon = $20 cut and was pretty satisfied."
"simply put i had a wonderful experience at this supercuts, corinne did a wonderful job with what i know is a difficult head of hair. i know its been the headache of hair stylists since i was a kid and she handled it masterfully. i know the online check in function sometimes messes up so i swung by after work and saw a pretty open salon(2 people waiting), had an extremely reasonable wait and then had a wonderful haircut. i'm not great with describing wonderful service but i know corinne gave it through a quality haircut and pleasant side chatter. she gave me some tips on my hair and i left with a clean haircut which for me is the ideal haircut experience. will be visiting again."
we got hoodwinked into a $50 haircut. i wouldn't go to supercuts if i was going to pay that. not worth it at all.
"i've had a few decent haircuts at this location, nothing exceptional but basically what you would expect at a supercuts. however, the previous two times that i either called in or booked an appointment online, the actual wait when i showed up was significantly longer, which is frustrating when going on a lunch break with a limited amount of time. specifically, today, a mother came in to get her daughter a haircut. i was next in line which would have corresponded with my expected time from booking online. however, the mother spontaneously decided that she wanted her son to get a haircut as well, and he was somehow immediately placed in front of me in line and i was told the wait would be an additional 15-20 minutes.this seems quite unprofessional and disrespectful of clients' time as i essentially wasted 10 mins each way driving to the location, as i didn't have the time to wait another 20 minutes. plus who knows whether the mother would have decided to get herself a haircut as well and been served before me. i will not be returning here in the future."
janet is a magician. i have never liked my haircuts but she literally makes me feel sexier. love this place. will never go anywhere else except to see janet. thank you so much.
kathy and janet are fantastic!! i'm extremely picky about my layers and in the 5 years i've been coming here i've never been even slightly disappointed! the stylists are all super friendly and well-trained. there can be a longer wait on nights/weekends but i always call ahead to check and put my name on the list so i don't have to sit and wait so long. i've tried other supercuts locations but this is by far my favorite!
"by far the worst supercuts experience i've ever had. i should have just returned at a later date when the lady in the first chair to the right was working. arrived at 615, i was told 20 minute wait and 2 people ahead of me. cool, no problem with me. well fast forward a hour and a half, an employee getting their hair dyed and washed, and about 8 people getting their hair cut before me, i get pissed. i asked the lady who informed me of my original quoted wait time and she tells me that the list just goes in order and that i'm next. i'm no rocket scientist but pretty sure i should have been next 6 people ago. super bummer cause the lady in that first chair cut my hair perfect every time. beware of ""super tuesday""."
"to be honest i wasn't expecting much, i mean i figured they wouldn't screw up my head so as long as they didn't do that i would have been satisfied. you see my favorite barber is no longer in the area so i had to go to someone new and i was not looking forward to it. but i was very pleasantly surprised, i did the online check in and showed up 20 minutes later and walked right in and sat down in the chair. ashley was my haircutter, and she really did a good job, i was surprised because it was a very good haircut and i had low expectations going in. also it took maybe all of 10 minutes which was amazing, quick and good, hard to beat that!"
"if you are the owner, please contact me.  i want a refund.  bad experience here.  i was charged for a service without being told beforehand that there would be a charge."
great haircut and really friendly staff. you get what you pay for and they have clean cuts here. the best i've seen from any super cuts.
corrinne is great!  i'm a hairstylist and new to the area and in need of a trim.  she took me right away and hooked me up with a great trim!  thanks corrinne!
nice location. all the people were great. busy but not too long of a wait. the hot towels are the best.
one of the best supercuts i've ever been too! i've been here on a few different occasions and each time my experience was great! even when it's busy the wait isn't terribly long. all of the stylist there are very courteous and extremely professional. i normally go to janet because she does the best job on my hair. i mean really this woman is a magician with clippers!!!!!! safe to say i won't be going anywhere else for my hair cuts. keep up the good work ladies.
"haircut was okay so i'd give it three stars and my barber was really sweet and nice. 2 stars because no one bothered to mention there was a check-in list so as people ahead were sitting down, i heard someone mention this list. needless to say, i asked the front desk lady, who was supposed to inform me, if there was a checkin. she said yes and checked me in...of course not after she let the people who came in after me go ahead.first chair lady definitely served her acquaintances before me. 2 as a matter of fact."
"kayla has been cutting my hair for the last year or so.  i found her by chance.  she is always pleasant, and courteous.  more  importantly, she always takes her time and does a great job.  i'm picky about my hair.  i've requested a complex scissor cut and a mixed clipper/scissor cut.  she's done great with both.  she follows directions and always aims to please.  i highly recommend her."
yesenia did an amazing job! i cut serval inches off of my hair because it was damaged from color treatments.yesenia was very kind and kept a great conversation & gave me some tips on how to keep my hair healthy in the future.she paid great attention to detail making sure my hair was cut perfectly straight & making sure i was happy with my final look! thank you! i'll definitely be back!
"ok, so have been to several sc and have had wins but lots of losses(in reference to respect to management). this location however just might have redeemed this chain/owner/franchise.frequented the location in college grove(for the love of god, keep driving and do not stop!) and needless to say the service each and every time was less than par. this combined with a rude associate led me to drive far out of the way to el cajon blvd, didn't give them much of a chance but on a whim i tried this spot and now i'm a loyal customer.for the first time in many years had a beautiful stylist give me the haircut i actually wanted without any hesitation or refusal! came out amazing and had absolutely no complaints. this was also not even. on my first or second visit here so i know this spot likes to take care of it's clients.don't be fooled as this location is right where your gps takes you. it's situated in a little side plaza by einstein bros. bagels and the rubio's (took me some driving around the first time to find it) and doesn't have any large enough sign to see from street.such a clean environment even post haircut as these ladies clean up and don't wait till it builds up. polite, talkative and fun. what's not to like?i normally get my haircut way long.in between but here can't wait to come back and get a trim just like today.enjoy the cut and don't forget to ask for your favorite stylist if they're here."
i've had the same hair stylist for almost 2 years and she never disappoints. brissia has been very helpul since the first day up until now and has a lot of patience with me :) i can't see anyone else cutting my hair. i recommend this place and brissia as your hair stylist. p.s.i'm her favorite client
"my stylist for the last couple years has been victoria.  victoria recently moved to the murphy canyon location from the more convenient location for me in pb - but i followed her.  and you would too if you let her do your do!  she is the only woman i let touch my lox - not even my ma can touch 'em.  seriously, i grew up with poker straight ugly hair with zero style. but now i get tons of compliments from both men and women.  last nite at nolita hall a woman ask me how i get my hair to look so good.  i tell them to go see vzamora @ supercuts.  and you should go see her too."
"just don't go here. went in for a bang trim and this is what i ended up with. i do not want to go back and have her attempt to ""fix"" it and make it worse. will not be returning, ever again. not happy that i even paid for this when most likely i'm going to be going somewhere else to fix this mess. skip this place!!"
i really enjoyed the managers professionalism and cooperation. we had an issue and she not only fixed the problem but exceeded my expectations. roxy is an amazing stylist and has great customer service.
"thank you roxy for the fabulous haircut and blow dry. my hair was a mess when i got to you and ever since you touched my hair, it's been so much better. it's been a week and i still even have my hair blow dried from when you did it a week ago. also thank you for the recommendations of products and the next steps. can't wait to see you again in 6 weeks for a trim!"
"awful experience. i don't know if it was just the employee i had, or an off night for this place, or if they're consistently terrible. i went in about a week and a half ago for a trim. victoria was my ""stylist."" i had scheduled an appointment online, but still had to wait about 30 minutes past that to be helped. the website did note that there might be a wait, but it felt excessively long and the two employees working didn't seem to be particularly focused on getting things moving. they were kind of just standing around joking with each other after the two customers i was waiting on had paid and left. victoria started trimming my hair, and in the middle of the cut she received a phone call. the other employee who answered the phone gave the handset to her on hold, and she proceeded to try to take it off hold, tucked it between her ear and her shoulder, and repositioned her comb and scissors to continue my cut while on the phone. this of course alarmed me, and i told her she could take her phone call and then come back to my hair later. there was no way i wanted her cutting my hair while focusing on the phone call. she just snapped at me ""i'm not going to cut it."" and then she proceeded to jab at my head with her comb while messing with the phone. she couldn't figure out how to get the phone off hold, so she kept pressing buttons, tucking the phone with her shoulder, then jabbing at my hair with her comb. this continued over and over again for a few minutes until the other employee came over to help her. once the phone issue was resolved, she hurriedly finished my trim. the worst part of this experience is how uneven the trim is, as you can see in the picture. after all that, she didn't even give me a proper hair cut, and this is after supercuts raised their prices. $21 wasted on a sloppy hair cut, and there's no way i'm going back there and letting here near my hair again."
"absolutely horrible, my hair is destroyed! i cannot believe the haircut i received! it looks like a 2 yr old cut my hair! i am livid! the experienced stylist let a very inexperienced stylist do my hair all while she sat back and watched!"
"i've been going to this location for over a year now, never been disappointed. roxy does a great job and always takes good care of me. i am very picky with my hair, and i love a super clean cut. my hard part looks always awesome and sharp. roxy has been giving me good advice on hair products and other treatments as well. an easy 5-star rating."
"roxy is great,  her cut is detailed and precise, she really listened to me , and that i appreciate, she educated me on some new products that i love!i will definitely be back in 2 months for a trim! she is one of the best!thank you , roxy, love the style!"
"clean, fast and on-point! i've gone to this supercuts for years now and have never walked away with anything but over-satisfied with the quality of service i've received.  i send all my friends to this particular store all the time... it's super clean... the stylists are top notch... very skilled and friendly.  i would recommend anyone check this place out. ps... i'm unintentionally very picky... so five stars from me!!!!"
savana gave my a super cute cute super fast! i went frommed-long hair to a super short bob. i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she replicated it!! she asked multiple times if i was comfortable with the amount she took off. loved my cut and how fast and easy it was. only waited ten mins to be seen. would defiantly come back. ask for savanna!!
"i witnesses the best customer service, above that, actual care for a customer. i was just walking in for a quick cut and one of the girls was holding and soothing a clients baby so she could finish her cut without her baby being upset. if i could give this a million stars i would! also, my cut was amazing so i will be coming back. roxy is a superstar."
"my regular hair stylist for 20 years went on vacation so i stopped in here. first i was told my hair had to be shampooed since i had hair spray in it. (i had shampooed it a few hours earlier) in 20 years at my regular place, concept salon, cutting my hair with hair spray on it was never a problem. so of course after the shampoo she cut my hair then asked how did it look. being wet i had no idea but it looked nothing like it did when i came in. i doubt many people want to look radically different when they get a haircut. as a finale she offered to sell me a gallon of shampoo.  i should have checked yelp- with 3.5 stars i would have gone somewhere else."
"my hairstylist kathleen moved to this location a few months ago so it's about time to review the location. this location has plenty of parking, is always clean, and there is a starbucks right next door if it is busy and you have a little wait. this location can get busy at peak times, so i recommend using their app to get on the list. also, i'm confident recommending kathleen to any yelper looking for a simple trim to a complex color job - she is worth the wait and there always seems to be a line of people waiting for her! she never rushes you, has great attention to detail, listens to what the customer wants, and is always bubbly and welcoming."
had an amazing experience here with a very talented hairstylist... roxy. very honest about my hair and took me thru all the steps of repairing it. awesome cut. and beautiful color. highly recommend roxy's chair. at the very least this talented crew. thank you! love my new look!
"roxy, is amazing. she is always willing to do whatever crazy idea i come up with. today she transformed into a beautiful unicorn. thank you roxy, the girls are all very welcoming, and it's it always a pleasurable experience."
"professionalism, courteous, cleanliness, and patience these are the qualities you should always look for when selecting a salon. well surprise you just found it. they do it all here. cuts, color, massage, and style. i know they offer additional services but i never looked into it. ask for roger, he is the best. periodi get the consistent high quality cut every time i see him. i'm in there every 3 weeks. i get the full package (cut, tea tree wash, and massage). the entire staff is great and a great team. they help each other ensure the customer experience is always great. i personally highly recommend this supercuts, but only if you want to leave extremely happy and have it done right the first time."
"i absolutely love barissia! she's truly incredible. after a failed cut from a lady at their location a few months prior, i decided to try again. she came to my rescue!! i have curly hair and she was able to give me an excellent cut which has always seemed impossible for other stylists. the best part is that she actually listens to you. if a style won't work, she's honest...and when it does, she freakin rocks it! that's a quality that is so appreciated. i see her, and only her now! i also bring my kids...she's our go-to gal. friendly, informative and just all around an amazing person. we love her!"
"sunday morning. time to get a trim. first time here. and i have to say: i had a great experience with cece. just beautiful cut. i've got me some long hair too that can be unruly. she handled my tresses with ease and gentleness. ahh, i luv it when my hair is happy. front desk was nice and pleasant. honestly, i have no complaints. coming back for a 2nd round when its time."
"don't let faryal cut your hair. i'm so disappointed. i walk in, and a few minutes later she tells me to sit down. i tell her i just want to trim my hair and fix it up. she just starts cutting. 5-10 minutes passes and she says all done. i've never had someone rush a haircut this fast. usually they're about 15-30 minutes. she rushed so much that i had hair all over my face when i left. she didn't even fix my sideburns.. she did such a poor job. i don't understand who hired her. she really needs to slow down and pay attention to what she's doing. moral of the story: she cuts hair way too fast and doesn't pay attention to detail. she just wants you off her chair and on to the next customer.the quicker the job, the less you get paid! take your time for gods sake."
"i've brought my son here five times to get a hair cut. five chances this place had to show that they could actually do a basic hair cut. failed miserably every time. i can overlook the fact that none of the associates there can blend a fade; my son's hair grows quick enough that it masks their ineptitude. what i can not get over, though, is not one single person in that place can cut a straight line. i literally have to go back and ask them to attempt to fix the crooked edging around his hairline. even then, it comes out no better, or worse than before. $19 plus tips for something i'm sure i could do just as good at home with a target clipper set. unbelievable. they've literally robbed me for $95, plus (unearned) tip(s)."
"i've gotten my hair done at this supercuts for 10+ years now and it's consistently better than the salons that charge $50 or more. and, yes, i have given several salons in that price range a try, but they always seem to mess my hair up. my case isn't even that complicated! that's why for my basic trim, supercuts is the best place for me.over the years a few different stylists have given me haircuts and i would recommend all of them. andrea, cecilia, and shirin are great! today, joanne trimmed my hair and she did a wonderful job too. she was very attentive to what i wanted, we had a great conversation, and she made the whole process so pleasant!i will keep coming back here. the salon is clean and the stylists are so good at what they do. where else can you get a great haircut for around $20? beats me!"
"their web app lies. the reported a 5 minute wait ended up being a 40 minute wait. this particular location is a mess. they use a 1980's system of writing names on a piece of paper then scratching them off when the customer is serviced, or they walk out in frustration. of course, the names on the paper don't actually reflect the order on who is decided to get called next. that's at the discretion of the floor manager.  when a stylist became available she would look around the room and figure out who gets called next. if you mentioned you used the app there seemed be some preference, or when someone complains and threatens to walk out they get the next stylist. a women that came after me complained and went ahead of me. if she wasn't getting her daughter's hair cut and i would have been very upset and walked out myself. i know kids get restless so i let it go.  there were apologies stating that the app never works and that causes all of their delays.. though it app seems to work fine for the escondido location. there are several negative reviews for this location,  this one is clearly rogue.- one of the lowest rated supercuts in san diego."
"don't let anybody tell you otherwise, theresa is the best and she's the only reason i have been coming to this place, 25 minutes drive each way, for over two years... you could say i am quite particular about my hair and how its cut and from the very first time i went to her, she has always done a 10/10 job. simply wonderful.she is great at listening to exactly what you want, but can help you figure it out together if you want to change things up and are not so sure what style/cut you would like done. she is always making absolutely certain that you love it and that it's perfect before you leave, and she will spend as long as it takes until you are 100% satisfied. i have never trusted someone more with my hair than i trust her and, trust me - that says a lot. theresa is the real deal!i'm a guy with medium-short hair but i have had more complex cuts and styles in the past and theresa has always been very patient with me and gotten me exactly the look i wanted. some of my family members have also been seeing her for cuts/color/etc for a long time and she is  masterful at all of it (men's and women's hair).we always leave there with a smile, looking and feeling great.theresa is a pro but she's also one of the sweetest people i know. she's by far the most requested person at this place so i recommend booking ahead for her if you can. i'd gone to fancy hair salons in the past and paid over $40 for a way subpar cut while with theresa i can get an awesome fresh cut that is perfect for a lot less, and i can be certain it will always look if i could, i would bring theresa with me across the country just to cut my hair, when i move. she's that good. make sure you ask for her when you book and you will thank me later."
visiting the area and needed an emergency haircut. arrived at 10:30 am and was told to come back at noon. back at noon and finally given to the new kid on the block who was sweet but very slow and unsure at 12:45 pm. it was a monday holiday and the place was packed which may have had something to do with the loooong wait although other reviewers have said similar things about waiting and waiting and....
i saw anna today for a root touch up. it was my first time there. she was so great!! i will definitely go back to her.
"nice place to come in and grab a simple hair cut when you are in a bind and your stylist is out. i showed the gal what i wanted and what i normally get. she quickly interrupted and said what she thought and if she just had let me finished my sentence/consultation she would have heard everything that i wanted with my hair. they did a great job cutting my hair, but sometimes, listening in the key."
no wait time and i had a relaxing time. june gave great recommendations and i'm very happy with my cut! i'll be making my next appointment here with june.
amazing amazing service!! they definitely took their time cutting my hair to make sure it was perfect. the service is extremely friendly and they really listen to their customers to make sure that they leave happy!!
"avoid this place if you can =/i came by and looking back i wish i didn't! yikes =x i could have done it better myself, that's how bad it turned out. i came by and was looking for a trim and new layers all around. the stylist was chit chatty with me and seemed like she was taking her sweet time with me cutting my locks, then all of a sudden she busts out the mirror and tells me to take a look while it was drenched wet and thick i can't see anything?! .. umm apparently she was done cutting  and i didn't even know it!??? i gave a shocked look.. i'm bad at keeping a poker face ;pthe next day it was obvious once my hair was dry that she did it super uneven and super choppy. the shortest layer on the back was super high and there were no layers in between the shortest layer and the bottom layer of my hair. and she told me if i notice anything i can come back.. ummm excuse me why would i come back so my hair can get butchered again?? no thanks! =x o.o"
actual conversation:me: i didn't wash the bleach out in time. i'm a mess. veronica: i'm sure it's not that bad. (me taking off the headband and removing tons of bobby-pins)veronica: we can fix this.    and then she did!
thank you to cecilia for the beautiful wash and blowdry today. my hair is very long and thick and you must have patience to do my hair. she takes her time and does beautiful work. i will be back and would recommend her to friends and family . don't forget to cal ahead so you don't have to wait !!
"i recently had the opportunity to be a hair ""model"" for a training session.  (apparently stylists stay up to date on trends and changes in the industry with continuing education and they occasionally need ""guinea pigs"".)   i won't lie, i was a little nervous going in, but could not have been happier with my hair cut and the whole experience. i was extremely impressed with the master stylist melissa, who facilitated the training and with the stylists, all of whom were on site for this early morning training before the salon opened for business.listening to the  stylists' questions and their sharing of collective knowledge during my hair cut really gave me a new appreciation for them and their craft.   i never realized how much goes into cutting hair... stylist's make it look so easy because they carry on relaxed conversations while they are working their magic.  i will never take a haircut for granted again. there are so many decisions to be made and specific techniques and tricks to use at every step of the haircut...and this is different for each head of hair and face. i walked out of super cuts with the one of the best haircuts i have ever gotten.  i was super surprised and super happy.  i have a new-found respect for the super cut stylists at the del mar highlands salon.  bravo!  i will be back."
"we had a terrible experience here!!! theresa. do not let her cut your hair. we came in with simple request: #2 on the sides, just clean up the top. she butchered my son's hair. she should not be allowed to cut hair. jagged razor line along side of my son's scalp, did not blend, did not trim or even cut a single hair on the top of his head at all. what a joke."
"wish i could give half a star for the rudeness of employees here!stopped by on thursday to make an appointment for friday on my lunch break. the woman told me a regular cut should take no more than 20 minutes. i confirmed this with her before i left to ensure my 2pm appointment would get me out of there in time to make it back to work. came in and checked in 2pm friday for my appointment and sat there for 15 minutes while workers partook in casual conversation with one another. as i began looking back and forth from the clock to the employees lounging around, no one said ""be right with you"" or even acknowledged my presence. when one employee was finished mindlessly chatting and called my name it was 2:17. when i asked if i would be done by 230, she and another employee sneered at me and said definitely not. when i said ""we'll i have to be at work in 13 minutes"" they stared blankly at me as if it was my fault they were engaging in conversation with one another when my appointment was supposed to begin 17 minutes prior. never coming to this location again. teenage mcdonald's employees are more professional than then the middle aged women working here!! horrible experience!"
i have been seeing andrea in this salon for years. her bubbly personality and charismatic attitude makes the salon visit something i love to do. whether it's a simple trim or a full on blonde make over she has all the skills! make sure to book asap as the girl is busy and this proves her skill in the trade. ask for andrea!
go to sherin for your cut! i always feel great whet i walk out. she does a fantastic job!
"the actual hair-cutters and/or stylists are fine. friendly and professional. but they really need to get their check-in system under wraps. it'll say 0 minute wait time, and i end up waiting for 45 minutes. it's happened 3 times in a row now. i can see other people have written about similar experiences. why can't they get this figured out? it was never a problem at the pb location. it really shouldn't be that hard...."
"can i take off a star because i hate the layout of this mall? it's so awkward!!!! i only mention it because it makes me dread going here. that aside, i came in and was introduced to marisela. what a queen. i am a cornucopia of disabilities and can not wash my own hair regularly. so i need a steady affordable place. crap. i think it's tuesday's they have discount cuts. marisela was sensitive to my needs, which required listening to me, and even hooked me up with a new do that i love!! i can guarantee you they have the cheapest prices i've come across in the city. again, double check the discount days, they're worth it. she was even kind enough to write down how she cut my hair in the event i don't get her next time. if it's up to me, it will always be her. save your money, give yourself a little hair me up and give marisela a shoutout from holly who likes the #3, round. hair cutter talk, shrug. ;-)"
"very disappointed and way overpriced.  i've come here many time for a quick trim & blow dry.  last time they massaged scalp, did a hot towel on face and asked me repeatedly how i liked the service.  this time, they rush thru, barely washed the shampoo out of my hair and was upset when i asked for a blow dry.  when i went to pay, they charged me $70!  that is full salon prices and certainly did not receive that treatment.don't waste your time or money here."
"3.5/5 starsmy husband needed a haircut and saw the supercuts sign. they were not busy so was able to walk right in after signing in on the computer. i really don't want my info on supercuts computers. we used a last initial instead and it was no problem. you can also book an appointment online which would be very handy for people who plan.the haircut was good for a good price. she was actually able to fix some problems from a former haircut. i wish i knew her name to give her credit. next time. i recommend this supercuts for a basic haircut since that's all we experienced. nothing exceptional, though. they were pleasant and had a good variety of products."
just wanna thank tamara murphy for the best hair cut i've ever had as an adult. plus i got an awesome shampoo and head massage. plus i ended upbuying the shampoo and conditioner she used. i don't live very close but next time i need a hair cut there's no place i'll be going but here. thank u again
"i was here yesterday. i hate my haircut. everything is uneven. i know i have curly hair and that's harder to cut but this is unacceptable. they get two stars because they are all nice people, i won't be back again though. at least the lady yesterday didn't aggressively try to sell me hair products."
"we have been searching for a new salon for the kids and this is it.  outstanding cuts, reasonable prices- especially on tuesdays!  the cuts are consistent, even across 3 different stylists.  we've been pleased with all of them.  it's so hard to find someone that your kids won't complain about- there's always something- she pulled too hard, it hurt, she cut my bangs too short,  etc etc.  and sometimes i have to agree .  but here, all three stylists managed to make at least this mom happy!  we will be back!"
"anytime you go to one of these ""first available stylist"" salons it's a total crap shoot with the quality of service and cut. this isn't just an issue with supercuts, but other places like sports clips too. even if you do find a good stylist, you have to go by their schedule and the good ones usually don't stay at any one location long. this location is one of the better ones because their online system is pretty reliable with only a few times i've seen ""call salon"". they also have more stylists on shift than other locations.out of 7 times i've been here i'd say 6 haircuts were fine, and one was terrible.."
"i came by today to get a trim, reshaping a prior haircut a bit shorter. aracely listened to what i wanted and delivered exactly what i asked for. very professional!"
"i explained in a very detailed manner to the hairdresser how i wanted my haircut. the hairdresser thought that a shorter version of what i wanted would look better and proceeded to cut my hair a lot more than previously accorded, without consulting me before. now my hair is extremely short and i had to go somewhere else to have an actual hairdresser fix it. very sad to know i paid for someone to do whatever they wanted with my hair especially when my hair takes so long to grow back. extremely disappointed and upset. avoid this place."
i got a really awful haircut and decided to take matters into my own hands. i ended up chopping my hair off unevenly and not leaving much to work with. i decided to give supercuts a shot. rebecca listened to what i needed and promptly fixed my hair. she was very thoughtful and made sure i was happy every step of the way. i was so happy i left a $10 tip. i'm also a girl who is picky about her hair so maybe that will give this review more substance? idk thanks rebecca
"so, i was in the area and my son needed a hair cut. christmas photos coming up(yeah we're a bit behind) anyway decided to stop by and get it out of the way. bad move. my son likes his skin fades and always gets the same cut or a variation of it. we went in and he was taken back almost immediately(yay). told the lady at the desk we wanted a fade.. i gave my son my phone to show the stylist a picture of what we wanted(a skin fade with a hard part). she looked and said okay and walked back with my boy. he followed her with my phone still in hand so i called him back to give it back to me. the stylist looks back and says she needs the picture to cut his hair. that should've been my sign to go ahead and ask for another stylist. i've never had a stylist take my phone with them to stare at a picture while they faded his hair. anyway i had forgotten my glasses in the car and was wearing my prescription sunglasses inside. visibility was no good from where i was sitting. i decided to get my glasses out of the car really quick and as soon as i got back(about a minute later) i had a pretty clear view of what was happening to my sons head. it was looking really off. i hate being rude but good lord the woman does not know how to fade. i was asked if it was good so i took the opportunity to walk back and see the mess up close. it was bad. i asked why it looked so chunky at spots and she replied ""that's the fade.""woah wait no, nothing about a fade is chunky or bald spotty. it fades. i responded that i knew what a fade was, he's been getting fades since he was 2. and then the hard part.. the line was not a line. it was a weird curve thing. i asked her why it wasn't straight. i grabbed my phone from my son and showed her the picture and asked how that looked at all like the picture. she then said, ""i didn't look at the picture when i did the line."" say what? she took my phone and had my son hold it just so ""she didn't look at it."" ?!?!? then said, ""that line is easier than what i did."" well that's just nice, why wasn't it done then? i wanted a simple straight line. i don't care what level of line you ""think"" you can do. give what was asked. anyway she then asked what she could do to make it better. man, i didn't know what to say besides actually fade his hair. i didn't have words so i walked away and just waited for her to finish. once she brought him out, all nice and butchered i looked over at his disaster haircut. i wasn't going to let the kid walk around looking like that and asked for someone else to fix it. luckily the manager came out and took him back and started to actually fade his hair. there wasn't much she could do about the horribly done hard part but she at least faded his hair the right way so thank you for that. we weren't charged which was why i gave 3 stars and not 2. word to the wise coming here, ask and make sure the stylist even knows what a fade is before you let them go at it. and to the stylist who cut his hair, next time please don't pretend you can do something you can't and end up butchering someone's hair. it's okay to pass on a client to someone who knows what they're doing. thanks."
"came by on my lunch and with a limited time to get my hair cut and luckily they had immediate openings. the store apparently had been pretty slow all morning, but soon after i walked in, it started to pick up. ashlyn trimmed my hair, its very long right now and had a ton of split ends so i told her all i needed was a few inches cut off and layers around my face. between the wash and the cut i was in and out in under 20 min! i am not even totally certain that she cut everything, but she swears she did. she used a few products in my hair and showed me what she used, both seemed nice! for now, i am super happy with my cut, although i have literally never had someone cut it so quickly. i heard the girl next to me say the same thing to the lady cutting her hair, so it seems like that's how they do it. cheaper cuts but they get you in and out quick. i have no complaints about that as long as its a good cut (which so far i think so, but will update this if i am wrong). cant complain about getting my hair done quick and easy and on the cheap (25$ is really nothing!!). thanks to ashlyn!!"
"i had an issue with a stylist few months back and had to rant my problems here.  since then, the owner reached out to me to personally apologize and offer me a chance to give them another chance.well i had the chance to go back twice so far and i have to say the two other styles were on top of their game.  they were one of the best styles i've had; they made sure the cut was what i wanted, catered to my style, asked questions and made sure i was happy before leaving the establishment.  these ladies know how to take care of their clients and experts in the way they handled all aspects of the business.thank you to the two stylists; ashlyn and tammy.  you both were wonderful!"
"i live in mission valley and was looking to get a haircut. gave supercuts a shot and can honestly say i haven't gone anywhere else since! super easy to put your name on the list via the app (or call ahead) so you don't need to sit and wait...or you can just walk right in, they have plenty of stylists so the wait is never really that long. i always request tamara, the manager, because she is super friendly and upbeat and simply knows what i want! but all the ladies here are friendly and know their stuff. treat yourself...get the scalp massage. :)"
i love this salon. it's always painless and quick! manager is very professional & friendly. i always recommend this particular supercuts to all my friends because it truly is great. every stylist has to go through vigorous training and it shows.
"the girl with the colorful hair did my our kids cut and it looks great, very happy with service and price and there was zero wait. $16 haircut and his hair grows fast so this was a great deal for us, we're happy and will be back"
i got very disappointing hair cut..the lady i got does not kno even how to cut. she is very unprofessional. i definately not go again this place.
"stylist miss ashlyn has done my hair the last several visits and she has an amazing touch and always nails the cut i ask for. miss ashlyn has a very kind demeanor and i'll bet that she makes all of her clients feel as if they are in caring and skilled hands.i brought my girl miss dana in yesterday for a major do-over and gave miss ashlyn carte blanche to do as she wished with miss dana's very long hair. an hour later, we left the salon as pleased as we possibly could. this salon appears to be extremely well-staffed and managed.thank you, supercuts, miss ashlyn and management"
"went in to get a little off the top, not almost all. told the lady twice just a little bit!! clean haircut, but not what i wanted."
"i very rarely leave reviews, for any business. but there are ""special"" occasions in which i feel they are warranted, good or bad. this is a mixture of both. i'll start off by saying that the lady that cut my hair was very nice. she also did a great job and my hair really looks good. the issue that i have is quite simple. i had a very strong gel in my hair and when the stylist went to run the clippers through it she felt it best to wash my hair. sure, sounds reasonable.... so i get my hair washed, she's explaining the shampoo and conditioner and even offers me a scalp massage. i get it, she's doing as most businesses do and that's to try and upsell me. i have no problem with that. the problem comes when i go to pay. my $20 haircut is now $24! i'm not worried about $4, i even still tipped the lady. the problem i have is that this additional charge was never mentioned. i wasn't asked if it was ok. i wasn't even told that is costs $4 to wash my hair. it was simply not mentioned. i feel this is a little deceitful. i think customers should be informed anytime that additional charges are going to be added to their bill. overall i was happy with the experience. clean place, good conversation, great haircut. i at least know now that if i decide to go back to make sure i ask, and not assume, that my $20 haircut will end up being $20. i appreciate the offer, ryan. i figured this was an oversight by the staff. i also could've asked and not assumed. it's really not that big of a deal and i certainly don't expect any sort of compensation for it. again, the overall experience was good. friendly staff and a good haircut. thanks again for the offer."
very good customer service!!! my son comes here every time he needs haircut. they pay attention what you like to have it done. friendly place and very pleasant.
"boyfriend got a haircut and after continuously explaining to the women that he wanted a fade and to not round off his head this is what happened. it was worse, he told her to fade it more and this is what he ended up with. waste of money."
"totally hit or miss. today i took my 4 year old son to get his haircut. each time i ask for it to stay longer on top and clean up around the ears.bravo maria for giving thomas the best haircut ever!!!this was a hit day.btw... this location is always super tidy, and everyone is friendly. at the end of haircuts they give the kiddos a lollipop!!!"
"went in for a cut with my son on sunday 8/19/18. $37 for 2 haircuts. well first off right off the bat they screwed my son's head up. i asked for a short fade one on the side 2 on the top and he has patches all through the sides of his head or they did not know how to fade properly. secondly when we went to leave i went to pay with my credit card $37 for 2 haircuts and i left a $14 tip in cash. the receipt they printed me out said $37 on it. my bank sends me text messages immediately when a transaction goes through so before i walked out of the store i had a text message saying supercuts in charge me $44.40. so i showed them this and asked where the $7.40 went did they add a tip without my permission what is it can you explain they told me no they told me that my information was wrong and they charged me what the receipt shows. well my bank doesn't lie and the receipt shows what it's supposed to but the transaction that went through on the bank is $7 more than the receipt shows so you guys stole my money. i have reported it as fraud and open investigation through the bank. i have my receipts the pictures and video from inside your store the way your employees handle the situation. i sincerely hope that someone from the corporate office sees this and contacts me to rectify the situation. not only should be store manager and employees should have training how to better handle situations like this, they should also have more training and customer service. will never return the supercuts"
"i got a fabulous ""haurcut"" at this location. no, i didn't request that one part be about half an inch longer than the rest but that's what i got. stuff happens and i'm a man so in the end i just smash it into place but a simple fade is the first haircut that you learn how to do. would give less stars if possible"
shahrzad gave me a really good haircut. she was really patient and cool despite of me being really freaky about my hair. happy with the haircut.thank you shahrzad.
update- got a cut from an asian lady (not dana) and currently am very happy with it. we will see how it turns out :) :) :)
jenny is amazing here! i first went here a few months back and was lucky enough to get jenny. i have been going back to her about once a month ever since. she is so friendly and engaging. she is a 10/10!!!
after 4-5 haircuts here i have to say this place is a disaster.  each time i go home and shower and no matter who cuts my hair i have piece of hair sticking out everywhere.  not to say many other places in santa clara area better.  i think santa clara is the bermuda triangle of haircuts.  only a few good places and you can tell they are good because they are completely booked.  definitely a huge gap to fill if anybody can bring a decent organization to the area.
"hit or miss period. they have couple of experienced hair stylist, the rest are just always new. high churnprice is competitive and you do get your appointment in a very timely manner- don't have to wait long"
"wish there was a negative star option. got a hair cut from here the lady was foreign, not asian i forgot her name. doesn't matter but this lady cut my hair and i have never been so disappointed in a hair cut. my hair is extremely choppy and it doesn't blend together what so ever. do not trust these people. they ruined my hair. first off cut it way too short when i hadn't asked them to cut off so many inches. second they were so inaccurate with copying the hair style i had suggested. and third let me walk out with the most ugliest hair cut i have ever had. so dissatisfied and so upset. never coming here again and i will make sure anyone i know will never come here."
"ionica did a lovely and efficient job shaping up my straggly ends into a bob that tapers under nicely. i've also had a cut by niloufar and color by phuong and maria. all did a great job.will definitely return for friendly, reliable service at a great price point."
"the most excellent service.  i bring my disabled son, who is in a wheelchair.  my son is not an easy cut .  but all the staff know my son's name and greet him with smiles every time.  i especially want to thank stylist fariba naji.  fariba is not only the best stylist at the shop.  she always goes above and beyond to help my son.   fariba, jimmy says hi and thank you for all that you do for him!  mu family highly recommends this shop.  if i could give 10 stars i would!"
i visit this super cuts even though its 5 miles away from home just because of phoung. she is amazing. not sure if she quit that place. if she did then its a bummer. went today and looks like entire staff has changed. ionica was my stylist. 1. she look stressed out. 2. zero customer service. at times sounded rude.3. she screwed up my hair. cut more on on one side then the other. finishing was pathetic. my hair looks like someone chewed it on the side. i will not visit this place again if phoung is not around.
i recommend phuong to everyone. she really can give you the hair you want or even better. :)she is very kind and professional. give her a chance and you will chose her to be your only hair-specialist.
"place is ok, nothing extremely awesome in hair cut they do, some of personnel is not really friendly and always in rush, and i noticed that in other locations, not bad place at all if u live close by and don't want make a reservation and wait for better quality and pricy locations"
"my sons have had a few good and some very bad haircuts (and bad experiences) here. not all of the stylists understand what a ""sports haircut"" is, and many take nothing off. a waste of time in some cases. they should train their newer people better. the people are all nice. their wait area is small. good location. but their haircut results are mixed (some good, many not so good)."
"not happy about the haircut or color service here. i asked for 2 inches off, there goes 4 inches instead. when it came to picking a color to even out my hair color and hide the highlights i got at a different salon back in february the girl wasn't confident with any color suggestions. when i was waiting for the color to set (which she left on for way too long) she kept saying ""i wonder if it will turn out good"" - not what you want to hear when you're getting permanent color... the color turned out much too dark for my complexion and was way over priced for just a supercuts salon. would not come here again for any hair services!"
i was charged 18 dollars for a simple haircut. plus tips.& it wasnt perfect. never going back there .
sue was great. had a hair cut and shampoo. she was really such a nice person. love to be here again.
"woah, what a convenient location considering what surrounds the area. there were two stylists there and little to no wait on a friday afternoon. i was able to get in and out within a fairly good amount of time. overall for what i paid ($20) and tip, i felt as if it could have turned out a little better. 4 stars for locations.maybe a different stylist next time around."
"not sure about other super cuts but this location is great for kids' cuts. great service , inexpensive cuts, and convenient location. i've been bringing my son here for almost a year and he gets a great cut every time. previously, i've taken him to ""real"" barbershops hoping for quality cuts. after seeing how quickly his hair grows/ how often he needs a cut, i figured i'd give something like this a try. this location is within walking distance from us so it's very convenient.after seeing how great his first cut here was from ana(she's no longer here), i figured we just got lucky with the stylist. after the first visit, he's had a different person cut his hair each time and it came out just as good. i believe the kids cut cost about 18 or so. it's a great place for a quick cut for boys."
i can't recommend this place!!! only if you want ugly haircut and wearing hat next 2 month (minimum)!!! in the pictures my husband with his new haircut!
"worst service forever. they cannot even do an easy blow out. they took forever, pulled my hair hundred of times and at the end my hair is still messy and i paid 50 bucks for it. they even asked me for a tip. will never go back again."
"i have been here a few times as it is close to work and i can walk over during lunch when it is not very crowded. the people who work here are polite, but the barbers failed to do what i asked for specifically. i have never had this problem at other barber shops. also the place was hot the last time i went here."
"worst experience ever. don't come to this place and waste your money. i did hair color and trim. the hair stylist left a lot of stains on my face, and didn't give me a towel after washing my hair. and they charged me extra 20 dollars for just a trim. i picked this place just because it's the closest to my apartment but the experience was so bad. never ever come back."
"i want this place to succeed some of the stylist can cut hair here but really you have to train your front office desk not just to be robots and idiots and create big lines and tell people to sit down when there's no place to sit come on, stupid cats get it right you can make a lot more money and make a lot more customers happy if you just get your front desk right. no excuse make it a user-friendly experience and watch your business grow come on supercuts, help me out."
"-friendly and attentive staff -clean and bright shopthe stylist, chelsea, knew exactly how to cut my bf's hair (combover). she listened attentively and repeated back how he wanted it cut. styled it really nice too."
"talk about nickle and dime-ing you to death!!! yesterday i called and asked how much a women's haircut cost.  they quoted me $18.95. upon entry to the establishment, kathy asked me if i wanted my hair washed. i thought nothing of it and said, ""sure, why not"". my hair had been in a bob style, and i did not particularly like the way the front was longer than the back, so i asked her to fix it and make it all one length. she kept cutting and cutting and cutting... at the end she proceeded to blow-dry my hair; somehow i thought that this was done for her to see if she had missed any stray hairs in her layering my hair and that it was included in the haircut. i told her that my hair was naturally wavy/ curly and that there was no way for me to style it by blow drying it or using a straight iron. kathy proceeded to blow dry and straighten my hair anyway. the outcome of all this? i was charged $6 for the shampoo, $18.95 for the haircut and $12.95 for the blow dry-- a total of $35+!! what's more, i left there looking like a guy with longish hair, far from anything like a bob. the closest thing that i can describe my hair to look like is a messed-up dorothy hammill. and it is so short that i am going to have to live with it for over a year!!! i want to scream. this is the last time i am going to supercuts. the reason i went there in the first place was because it is a chain and i was depending on being understood by someone who spoke english better than the place i normally go to. i guess that's what you get for letting someone who's native language is not english."
very nice that you can come here every time during the day. no appointment needed. this spot quite busy but they will allow you for hair cut just in 10-15 min. good for those people who don't expect to much from average pricing barberry shop. fast and easy. friendly personnel
"they are open at 9 am in the morning. i came in at 9:03 am. i was the 3rd person while the first two just got started. people who came after me would get the service. they call out names of people with appointments which is logical, but when the people are not present, they would still not call who is sitting there. couple of people who cane after me would get the service without the appointment. i got a feeling they are discriminating me by my race. just because they are not indians they would get service without appointments. bunch of racist creatures. and when you ask, the people say, oh did you come? we didnt notice, you are next. if you have appiintments lined up, you could have told me we are fully booked for morning or something. instead you made me wait and insulted me by not treating equal to other customers without appointments. it is 9:50 am now, i missed 1 hour and you have 3 saloonists who served 9 customers so far before me. i could have gone to another center. and if i  am really not the next, then i would rather do it. this is the second time i have a complaint on this center. first time my girlfriend wrote a review on behalf of me. and they call me and give me a coupon with a sorry. and made sure they wouldnt guve such treatment again. this time it is slightly different issue but still the same ridiculous behavior."
this review is for kathelyn who did a tea tree scalp massage and blow dry for me today. she really took her time to massage my scalp with the right pressure and style my hair with care all the while talking to me about what i liked. i'd like to see her again soon. services like scalp massage are usually hit and miss. i came out feeling better than i went in. all for just $22+ tips. i could do it every day!
absolute joke management with zero accountability. dont expect them to honor your reservation. i would avoid at all costs.
"have been visiting this salon off lately. staff is very friendly, never impatient or in a hurry which is why i prefer this salon."
this place was superb when rich was here but after he is gone this is down the drain.if anybody knows where rich is working now please let me know.
"first time i have them benefit of the doubt, maybe i didn't explain what i want. the second time it was pretty clear, they don't understand english, only know to cut hair as short as possible and then try to sell someproducts. stay away"
"pretty disappointed. my usual hair stylist was closed, but i had a hankering for a haircut so i stopped by here because it was the only place open. a middle aged woman had helped me.points of displeasure -texted throughout the haircut -rough with my head-haircut was mediocre in general -didn't bother to dry off my hair- didn't even acknowledge me after i paid. just had me sign and walked away. didn't give me a receipt  or that usual thank you or whatever.for $18 + tip, definitely not worth it. i've had better service from a $10 haircut salon. i definitely don't reccomend this place."
"i've been going to lynn for a year now and she is the best hairstylist i've ever had. the first time she cut my hair, i got lots of compliments from friends and coworker about the great job she has done, so i kept going to her and she always does amazing.she gives suggestions and listens to mine and she's extremely personable. during the haircut, she pauses for feedback while there is still time for course correction, and tells me exactly what she did to my hair so that next time she will know what worked.lynn is awesome, super friendly and very professional. i can highly recommend her!"
this is the last straw. i'm done with this place. even just 2 years ago i was so down to get ma haircut here. things have changed... the staff has clearly changed from the first several times i've been here. the workers are now mid aged asian women who have very limited knowledge of how to get it right. i get ma head shaved completely and ask to be lined up... the women says okay and cuts a straight line down. strike one. i later notice after i leave that she didn't line me up at all and in fact one corner of my forehead is now slightly farther back than the other. so my face looks slightly disfigured now... -______-not coming back!
"i'd like to give zero stars! we walked in and immediately the stylist already cutting someone's hair asked in a rude tone if i had called ahead. i said no (as i didnt know you needed to). she says again in a snotty tone that the wait is an hour and a half. i said ok. and she then said we had to wait there. it was as if she wanted to scare us into not getting a haircut there! and to think, we had never been there before so that was our first impression of that place! needless to say, we left."
"my friends and i have been coming here for budget-friendly cuts for over a year. for a trim or simple cut, you can't beat the value for your dollar.recently, i've had my hair cut by stephanie twice. she not only gave me great-looking layers, she also has a very pleasant and chill presence. i appreciated her double checking the trim length with me in the mirror and asking how i liked my hair throughout and so on. my hair is tricky because it's damaged and hard to work with. both times she was able to give me the cut i hoped for on top of helping me achieve healthier hair.thanks, stephanie!"
one of the better supercuts. i go here from time to time for a cheap trim. i don't know her name but she's a vietnamese lady and did a great job keeping my hair long but chopping off enough to get rid of my split ends. i was happy with her cut. i don't ever feel pressure here to buy anything which is nice. also plenty of parking. wait is never more than 10 min on weekends.
"pretty bad service. haircut took almost twice as long as they usually did at the old supercuts palo alto which i miss and the lady helping me never said a full sentence to me which made it very hard to communicate what i wanted. a haircut is a detailed thing and anyone giving one should be able to communicate more clearly than with a ""this ok?"" and a gesture. the lady cutting my hair had to get this other hair cutter to come finish off my haircut. i didn't ask for anything complicated or unusual! shouldn't they be trained in a school on this not in a retail shop? miss the palo alto location people there were always at least workable and they usually made sure they were clear on what i wanted ."
good cut for my son. quick and efficient and the woman was nice and friendly. expensive though.
"went in a few months back; had pre-scheduled an appt. on their app, and everything was going ok until the cut was done and i decided after review that i needed more cut off.  the stylist was a bit perturbed and kept saying over and over 'ok, so you're changing what you originally told me'....i tried to ignore her as it was obvious she was trying to guilt me out of changing my mind.  she then said if she was to have to start all over, she'd have to charge me for another haircut, and then pointed to the people waiting and mentioned that they'd all have to wait longer now too (definite guilt trip)!  i said forget it, paid and left.  i have never had a stylist or salon do this to me before - what's the point of having you check your haircut afterwards with two different mirrors and ask you if it's ok if clearly the idea is that they don't want to hear anything but 'yes'?!  i had been going to this supercuts for years until now....i won't be back."
horrible customer service the hours are until 8. i came in at 7:50 with an emergency i son cut a big chunk of his hair off. i walked in and asked if they were closed the two girls said no so i said can i just quick cut for my son since he had school tomorrow and after say no they are getting ready to close and went on with the conversation they were having. horrible customer service!!
"oralia did a great job.great cut, very professional ... even did my eye-brows!keep up the good work"
"after coming here for over 10 years and having decent but inconsistent hair cuts, the last cut broke the camel's back. i asked for a scissor cut and then she bluntly says, ""i'll use the trimmer and a comb"" and then proceeds to lop off a bunch of hair. i'm not sure why she asked me how i normally get it cut if she couldn't care less. in the end, i'm almost 49 years old and i came home with a frickin mullet. i am resolute that i will never go back to this supercuts and probably never to any supercut again. the bad haircut is one thing, but to be disrespected and to have bad service is enough. go elsewhere."
"$53 for a haircut?!  i may as well have gone back to aveda salon on santana row.when my normal hair stylist at aveda moved to texas, i decided to ask some co-workers for recommendations.  inocencia at supercuts was recommended to me.  i haven't been to a supercuts in a while, but i figured i would give it a try, because my co-worker has great hair.  inocencia gave me a great haircut.  if she ever changes salons, i would be happy to go back to her.  but when i went to pay for my haircut, i was in for an unpleasant surprise.  the price of a haircut on the board was $18.95.  i decided to treat myself and get the shampoo ($5) and blowdry ($12).  so my total bill should be $35?  right?  but when i checked out, the cashier and manager told me i had ""style and blowdry""  (a what?) not a regular blow dry which was way down on the bottom of the price list not anywhere near the haircut package i thought i was getting.  a ""style and blowdry"" costs $35.   how this makes any sense, i have no idea.  so they said my bill was $18.95 plus $35 = $53.  why is a blow dry more expensive than a haircut?  how was i supposed to know there is a difference between blow dry types (i just got it done straight, no fancy wedding hair.)   inocencia was in agreement and tried to support my case, but we both lost.  and guess what supercuts?  you lost too because i will never go back to a supercuts ever again.   my aveda cut and blowdry cost $65 but i also got a massage in the package and the experience was much better.  i will be going back to aveda in the future -- inocencia, maybe you should join me there!"
"firstly, service was friendly. got my hair cut by tina. she did a great job and listened to what i wanted."
"got my hair cut by emma on tuesday.  she did a great job.  listened to what i wanted, looked at pictures that i brought of different cuts i liked, suggested cuts that would be good for my hair type and facial features.  she just doesn't cut hair, she's a great stylist.  prices are cheap, the place was clean and the staff friendly."
i've been coming here for a deep conditioning treatment with marcela since oct and she has worked miracles with my hair! it's is so much healthier and she has helped me keep it long and healthy! i never have to wait too long and the staff is always friendly.
"i get a no frills hair cut and try to be very specific about what i want and 80% of the time i am pretty happy with my cut. it is the times when i am feeling lazy and don't really care that my head gets askew.for the price and convenience, i am really happy with this location and expect what i pay for when i take the time to explain what i want.i like the call ahead feature and now that i found my favorite stylist, when she is in the country i can get a decent cut.whoo hoo."
"this is pretty hit or miss place. first time was good, second time was terrible -- hair cut was uneven and i had to fix it up at home, as i was rushed out when more potential customers started lining up for haircut. it's $17.95 for a full haircut. pretty dissatisfied with this particular place."
"thank you crystal! don't leave without having ""the tea tree experience"". my stylist crystal was kind enough to suggest this amazing addition to the standard shampoo. tingly tea tree shampoo along with a hypnotically relaxing scalp massage, finished off with a steaming towel face wrap and i felt like floating! i wish i could have one every day, like getting a spa treatment at supercuts. of course the haircut was perfect too,  she took care to be sure i had exactly what i wanted done and that i was happy before i left. i will definitely be back!"
"i went here yesterday and i wanted more than a standard haircut, i wanted a jet-black coloring job.   the stylist who took care of me, sarene, had over 20 years of hair styling experience, said it wouldn't be a problem. turns out, she knew exactly what she was doing.  because i'm just reaching the age when my hairline is starting to recede a bit at the temples, she cut it in exactly the best way to maximize the look of my hair and was careful with applying the right solutions in the right proportions to keep the dye in my hair and off my skin.she was sweet the whole time and did a lot of little things to assure my comfort, saying nice things like how good it was to be pampered, complimenting my looks, and giving me a scalp massage during pre-treatment and another when the color rinsed out, and the ""tea tree"" treatment which helped lock in the color.  she also recommended an excellent product to keep my colored hair healthy afterward, and i'm very pleased with her work and look forward to going back for a touch-up and future treatments.  the whole process took about 1.5 hours and was reasonably priced at $45 for the color job plus $10 for the tea tree treatment.i made sure to tip her generously for her work, because she totally deserved it!this place does take appointments, so if you're planning on a great cut, style, or color, i would call and ask specifically for sarene's service.and if you're a member of aaa, don't forget to bring in your card to get a 20% discount on everything, services and products alike, something you will need to ask for as they don't tell you about it up front.they also have a ""cut card"" where you get stamped every time you come in and your 13th cut is free.  but again, you will need to ask for it, or ask them to stamp it if you've already got one."
"first off, the service was friendly. the lady welcomed me with a warm welcome and made sure that i was being helped. now to the haircut. for $17, the haircut was a good quality, the cut being pretty even. although, the upper right side of my head has a small patch of hair that the hairdresser did not touch, even after i told her that it needed to be trimmed. lastly, she gave me a warm towel to wipe the excess hair that was on my face during the cut. all in all, the experience was great and the place looked amazing, but since one side of my hair is uneven, i give it three stars. i would recommend this place to anybody who wants a simple, quick, and inexpensive cut!!!!"
"is $130 for a haircut and highlights too much? i have long hair and have never gotten high lights before and wanted to go somewhere ""cheap"" this doesn't seem cheap. and it's gonna take 3 hours... oy vey.  and they don't have color samples i just have to trust they know what they're doing...at least it sounds like they do. we'll see, i'm waiting for the girl to get her coffee before she starts :-/"
went here for the first time last week to chop all of my hair off (kind of a scary thing!) luckily marcela was awesome and walked me through everything super patiently. i will definitely be coming back just for her... recommended!
"i went to this supercuts once and had a terrible haircut. i complained to supercuts and they were great around giving me a voucher for a new haircut. i went again to this same location and again had an awful experience. i normally get a buzz cut. somehow each time i get this simple cut here, they miss 40% of the hairs on my head and make it look terrible. my regular supercuts in campbell does an excellent job. not sure why this particular store is consistently bad."
"omg charlene is the best!! moved to south bay last year and have be putting off...and off...and off...the oh so inevitable search for ""the one"". and i found her! she is really knowledgeable, and she knew exactly what i wanted, and i am so happy to have given this little store a chance. thank you charlene! see you soon =)"
"honestly one of the worst haircuts ive had so farthe indian lady who cut my hair messed up my hairline on my left forehead and in an attempt to fix it, messed up my right forehead hairline too.nothing but a nightmare, wouldnt reccommend to anyone"
grace magic hairdresser - polite and very friendly. very highly recommended.
my boyfriend and i came here the other day and i definitely don't recommend it. they didn't cut my boyfriend's hair the way he wanted to and they cut my hair much shorter than i initially wanted; giving me layers. and we both specially told the women how we wanted our hair done.
"grace is my haircut hero, she found a cut that fits me since the first time i visited this location. i don't understand why no one told me before that what my hair needs thinning  scissors only."
grace is the reason why i continue to come! she takes care of my son and recently she shampoo'd and blew-dried my long hair and it was an amazing experience.  my hair made it through the day and wind! thank you grace! loved it!
i had a great experience at super cuts. shahrzad gave me a great haircut and she was so friendly as well. i definitely recommend this place.
grace is amazing and cuts extremely well! was happy with my hair cut. their cool attitude was a big plus! will be seeing you soon!
i went there today with my sister and we both felt that we were cheated big time! grace charged us twice that of the amount promised. very sloppy job of shampoo and quick less than 2 mins massage.one star is for the blow drying job only. this branch needs to teach their staff for better communication and honesty.
jackie's awesome! i checked in before leaving my house and only had to wait for 15-20 minutes. she made sure i like the length before she cut and listened to my requests instead of talking me out of them. she also styled my hair for free just because she's not busy. i would come back again & i highly recommend her if you go. thank you jackie!
today i went in for the hair color and the hair cut. jacky helped me with everything and she did a great job. all the staff are super friendly and nice! it's so funny cause i was at the store when those two ladies came inside and got their hair blow dried! they both had tick hair and took so much time of grace's and she already gave them discounts. it's so sad how some people like to take advantage of others and not show appreciation! anyways my husband and i always go to that supper cut even through it's far from where we live cause of their friendly staff and awesome job they all do. thanks jacky and the entire staff for taking good care of your customers!
"i've been going here for a couple years because it's close to work and love the staff. grace, jackie, and everyone i've had has been professional and they all do a great job."
this is the only place i will come to get my haircut. jacky is the best!!! i followed her here from another location because she is so great! jacky remembers things about me even though i am not so good about coming to see her as often as i should. she is always happy to see me and makes me feel like an old friend or even a member of the family.when i first saw her a few years ago i told her that i need to wash and go because i am what i call blowdryer illiterate. i have said this to stylists in the past and before i met jacky thought i liked my haircuts. she gave me the best cut i have ever had in my life!!! she also picked my hair color for me and i love it!!!!! it is the perfect color for me. she has also helped me with selecting hair products that are best for me. jacky is amazing.
been to this supercuts for years and grace has been absolutely amazing. she remembers how i like my hair cut and she always has an awesome attitude. she brightens everyone's day and makes this a great experience.  i highly recommend this place and especially grace!
i have curly hair and hardly satisfied with any of the haircuts i get. actually i'm a bit picky about my hair style. a friend of mine recommended sherri on this branch of super cuts. i thought to myself it worth trying... and i think finally i find my hair stylist! she is really skillful and i finally got the haircut i wished for many years. i think she really deserves a five star review. thank you so much sherri!
"as much as i like some of the hair dressers here, it is just ridiculous if you have to wait for an hour, even after an appointment. if you value time this is not the place.update: i did get the haircut after the wait and am very happy with it. they gave me a $2 credit, i understand it is a token, no issues, it's not the money as my tip was more than it.i understand some customers may come in for some service and then decide for more which can take extra time. but then let the customers with reservation know the reality so they can plan. in my case 39 min after the time reserved i even offered to reschedule to a different time or day as i had to take my daughter for soccer. i was told 5 min more which ended up lot longer. there are way better ways to handle customers: both who demand more service than initially asked and ones who booked online thinking they can avoid long wait. recommendation to business - value your customers. you have some good hair dressers but if you cannot provide proper customer service you'll loose customers like me. i was a loyal super cuts on prospect rd customer till they messed up with service on several occasions. please don't stoop to that level and fix the issues."
"grace is a world class hair stylist and star of this location. jackie, another stylist at this location initially gave me a bad haircut and i had to go back to get it fixed. grace fixed my haircut for free and transformed the original bad haircut into an extremely good haircut. grace's skills and customer service are both top notch. they should give a promotion and raise to grace for her excellent skills, customer service and for making up for the faults of others on the team."
"i visited super cuts for the first time. very happy with the layered haircut and blow dry. my hairstylist was very friendly and she did a very good job. i thought this place is cheaper, but i paid $55 for haircut plus $5 for tip. its the same i used to give in ulta.  but still i am happy with the hair style"
"couldn't even understand the blonde lady cutting my hair. she had big glasses. waiting for about 45 minutes for a trim. i asked for a trim with shampoo and blow dry and assumed the blow dry would cost about the same as the shampoo. no one told me the price. blow dry was $50 wtf and took over an hour to wash, cut my hair one inch, and blow dry. when she was washing my hair she scrubbed the dye out of my hair and got my face shirt and arms all wet. 10/10 will not go back again"
"been here twice with my boys.   they just don't care.  our first time, the haircut was sloppy on my older son who wanted his hair crewcut.  they had no idea what that was.   the second time, was for my younger son who has lovely long hair.  he wanted it trimmed for his halloween costume.  i specifically told the lady to please cut an inch off the back and give him a layer.  i turn around and she's butchering his hair with the clippers.  i don't get it, don't all people who cut hair know what layers are?  my son was in tears and i was close to them.   that was the last time i'll go!  i asked her what she was doing and she was so clueless and didn't care either!  seriously go somewhere else.  i know supercuts isn't the most quality but this is beyond bad."
"this was my 2nd time going to this supercuts location. customer service wise not too great. there were about 4 ladies just working on stocking up products not even caring who comes in the store. i got seated right away with a asian male stylist. at 1st i was quite skeptical because i couldn't really understand his english, but i showed him a photo of what i wanted and explained to me he couldn't do it like that and instead did his best to cut the way i want it. overall he did an amazing job. for the price is just perfect. instead of going to those salons to have a haircut for $50 and such i got mine for $19."
"i have been going to coleman super cutsfor 3 yrsalway had good hair cutsbut this last cut was horriblewent there 2 times but but same old asian lady was there,so i went in there today,7 days later to get someone else to trim it up and wes refusedif there was a negative 2 i would use itthe girl agreed but the manager said no!!!would only take 6 min or soso much for satisfeid customersi will never go there again................"
"if yvonna was still there it would be 5 stars for sure.  she always did a great job every time, and did a perfect fade.  haven't found anyone there that can do a good a job as her."
"the guy that cut my hair was kind of short with me.  i was looking for some advice and he kind of just barked questions at me.  i got my haircut and it's not really what i was looking for and it wasn't even styled, just cut and air dried.  i'm not happy at all honestly, i just wasted $25 and about to spend even more to get it fixed at a place that gives a shit."
vanessa cut my hair and was very professional and accommodating. she knew what i was talking about when i had a request for my hair line. i noticed the way she cleaned her station before she called me too. she thoroughly cleaned every razor head with a brush and tapped it on the counter to ensure all hair was removed. she sprayed sanitizer on both sides of each item she had used: laying everything down and then flipping it over for each spray. she also greeted every customer that walked in and let them know someone would be attending them soon.
"i am giving 1 stars for the worst hospitality and also for the dumb asian hairdresser i have ever seen in my life. using asian as i don't know her name. the reason for my bad review is because even saying her to cut only an inch from the existing hair, she went ahead on her own left me with such a short hair. on top of it, it took months to grow the beard and i regret asking for beard trim. i asked her to have it little structured and ended up loosing my beard style. she was not able to even tell the difference on what goof up she did. my left side was way up than right. and when she fixed left, it wasn't a surprise that now right was way upper than left."
"absolutely the worst quality haircut ive ever had... the younger blonde woman that has the station by the register moves way too fast and doesn't communicate on what she's doing. i'm 45 years old and i get my haircut every two weeks, i think i have it down pat on the instructions i give and what i expect when it's done . they were not busy and there was no reason for her to rush so quickly. if you want a different haircut every time you go there this is the place for you."
"just called for an appointment at 5:30pm. easy. asked for layers with a ""deep v"" back but it wasn't ""v"" enough. whatevers. i came in knowing that where ever i go to get my hair cut, my hair will be chopped off half the length (my hair reached my belly button, now it's at my clavical). i'm pretty sastified since the price for a hair cut was just $19.99. great service, nice workers and in and out in 40 mins."
"cynthia is an angel. she salvaged my hair in under an hour. i'd gone to a different chain for colour the day before and my hopeful summer ombré dreams were squished with a bad blend and super bad damage on the ends.cynthia recommended a protein treatment and gave me the cut i wanted. she was so fun to talk to and we swapped salon horror stories. when she was finished i could move my fingers through my hair again. my hair instantly felt better. it still needs to be babied for a while, but i feel like i can go out in public now. thanks, cynthia!"
"i call in, they tell me to come in and when i do, they tell me they don't have time.i try to make a reservation for the next day they won't let me! they only take same day reservations.i come in, they tell me to wait 30 min, i wait for an hour, no luck, i leave....what is wrong with supercuts? they can't handle a simple reservation system. people plan their day, show some respect."
"i know this is petty of me to say, but how does a stylist not know what a pixie cut is?! this is the second time i've had this particular stylist (i want to say his name is nathan) cut my hair and yes it had been like 3 months since the last time he saw me, but you'd think you'd remember the girl who wanted a pixie cut who had to show what it was via picture what that is because he didn't know! also a small disagreement that i wanted something like the picture i showed him and he kept telling me it was a #1  clipper and i told him i've always had a 3 1/2. sorry, i dont care what it looks like... just do a style like the picture but do what i tell you to do..is that really that hard? ugh. if i didn't like the other ladies who work there i wouldnt come back because of him. i'm requesting one of them next time."
"go to this place only if you don't value your time. i called them in advance today (sunday, november 19) and they told me that the wait line is ~ 1 hour. so they signed me up to come in an hour. when i actually arrived they told me to wait a little and that they would be ""right with me"". after waiting for 15 minutes and not seeing any progress i asked the cashier lady when could i expect to get my service. she answered that there are two more people ahead of me, my call in advance didn't matter at all and that they didn't have sign ups and a adjusted the line in accordance with how many people walked in. as a result i had to leave without service (wasted my time) because i had other things scheduled later on that day."
"the staff in this location is rude to customers.  natalie, the store manager was yelling at customers right in front of me.  this is not a good environment!!"
everything about this place is terrible. rude hairstylist that do not listen a $20 haircut is going to cost me so much to fix! i asked for a trim and i got a choppy uneven mess! all she did was criticize my hair and have nothing but negative comments about everything. i understand having a bad day but at least cut it the way i ask! do not go here!
this salon is really good i like it. they spent a good time on my hair cut :) also the employees are really friendly !
"horrible horrible horrible, and i don't recommend any women to come here for hair cuts! normally, i go to asian salons, but i decided to try a new place because my cuts are quite expensive (usually $50), so i came here because i saw pretty decent reviews, and the price was significantly lower ($19) than what i usually pay. i always get my cut the same. ""please trim the damaged ends, and keep the v-shape."" i never caught her name, but it was an asian lady who cut my hair. her hair was layered, black, and maybe to her mid back or a bit shorter. my hair originally was down to my butt. now, it is at my shoulders!!! i told her to cut my ends, and she literally cut off more than a foot of my hair which took me years to grow out. i have never been more upset after getting a haircut. it's not even shaped in a v like i asked! my hair is just very awkwardly shaped now. worst part is that i wanted to look good for an upcoming banquet, and now i'm going to have to spend a fortune fixing my hair somehow with extensions. very very upset, and now i think i'll just stick to my $50 haircuts once my hair is actually back to it's normal length in a couple of years."
"cheyenne did an amazing style with cut and even more amazing with highlights to dark hair. i would recommend to anyone who needs a professional color, cut and style. a return customer always.......phyllis & jenna"
i have been to this place many a times and i was pretty okay with this place. but this time i had an encounter with an unwelcoming lady. i am not aware of her name but she had blue colored hair. the cut she gave me is terrible. she was cutting hair as if its her first day at job. no manners. no courtesy. absolute rude and unprofessional person and truly a novice. how could supercuts appoint such people? this place used to be good but now its absolutely a place to be avoided. for my recent experience i want to give 0 stars but luckily there is no such option.
"i went in for a trim but decided to live a little and cut my hair. i should've known better. if i could turn back time, i would've turned the car around and peeled it back to my usual places or actually just gotten a trim.the haircut was bad. the type of bad you leave the store with a sinking feeling and a boulder in your lstomach bad. the bad you get when you ate too many chicken nuggets in college at 3 am bad.i got layers on my previously long and shiny hair (rip). well, when i say layers, i meant ""layers"" as in keep the original length but add some volume but putting in layers. holy s this lady (god bless her soul i didn't remember her damn name) cut across the middle of my hair in what looks like a poor replication of an avant garde art piece. it looked like steps.okay, now i have steps. what's next. she also had no idea how to blend in said steps to look natural. nope. she just put down her tools and told me to look at the mirror. uh no. can you please try that again. she cut literally an inch below where my old ombre hair started and my natural color ended. it was now a step and a bar of color. after another try it still looked terrible and i decided to cut my loss and just leave. my hair went in smooth (after many months of hard work and care), long, and healthy looking. my hair now looks frizzy, damaged, and a s---show. she didn't attempt to talk to me at all until the last 3 minutes when she was trying to be subtle and think of convo to get her tip.no.nonononono good thing hair grows back."
i went and a woman was wearing dirty black latex gloves i thought maybe cuz she was at the register but no she sanitized her gloved hands and started running her hands thru my hair. i half wanted to vomit the cut my hair like dora the explorer yup never again. swiper no swiping
"i called at 9:45 on a saturday morning and they scheduled me for 11 that day. i only waited five minutes before my stylist called me over. super efficient. i think my stylist's name was aman (i'm sorry i forgot!) and i adored her. she was incredibly accommodating, friendly, gentle with my brain cavity (much appreciated!), didn't push extras on me but offered them. i was grateful she knew how to hold a conversation but didn't force small talk on me. also importantly, she did a great job with my cut and didn't shame me for the terrible state my bleached mullet was in. considering what she had to work with, she proved her stylist skills.the a-line cut was $24, which included a shampoo. and she dried/ styled it for an additional $15. for someone who pinches pennies, it was a great deal. i'll be back for future hair cuts!"
"come here for choppy cuts :/i wanted a trim for my hair, cut straight--the exact same style i have now, which is straight--cutting off an inch. the lady that cut my hair, who i never asked for the name of since i forgot to, didn't even seem like she knew what she was doing. when i asked for a soft v-line, she said it would look weird and didn't do it; it was my choice and style for my hair, so why does she get to choose what i can do for my hair? she then said she wanted to cut an a-line, and i rejected because i'm not a doll to experiment with--especially with my hair, but i clearly made that mistake by having her cut my hair to begin with.not often did she grab onto locks of my hair to lift an cut, like most professional stylists do. she cut it straight by asking me to tilt my head and bringing the shears, trying to cut my hair straight as if she was tracing a line with scissors on paper. so her technique was poor. she constantly looked at the mirror as she cut my hair, and told me my hair was even when it wasn't (my left side was longer than my right and she didn't fix it).throughout my cut she kept on recommending me different styles i should do to my hair and commenting about it: ""your hair is so dead"", ""you need to re-color it's so uneven"", ""color this higher next time"", etc. thanks, but i'd rather not listen to someone who is a stylist that can barely cut hair.she gave me so many layers when i asked for subtle layers, and i despise it so much. i tie my hair in a half-do because the cut is so bad and i have to wait until my hair grows out for me to get a better, even cut. oh, and she forgot to cut certain parts of my hair so they were my original length; i had to get scissors at so it myself at home.the price for this trim and horrible outcome is still $20.00 for some reason, and it's $20.00 for both men and women, but i say you save your money for elsewhere.the waiting time is not bad at all for a sunday afternoon. we were treated right away without a line waiting prior to us, and the receptionist was very friendly and kind--and professional.even so, i'm not returning and i recommend you to be careful! if you have a bad feeling about your stylist, listen to it or you'll end up with a cut like mine!"
i feel the service there are not worthy the price. men cut in 10 min for 20 while the service is not different.
"i wish i could give a negative rating. the staff is horrible and not courteous at all. i have been to salons where the staff can't speak english but they try to understand customer's needs. she just started the haircut without even trying to understand what kind of cut i wanted. when i explained, she said ""i know my job"". wtf. she also insisted on me getting the hairwash when i didn't want. worst experience. had to walk out without a hair cut."
i've been in other supercuts and this one is much better. it has the same low prices and most importantly the same simple reservation process. people here are very friendly and so far i've been happy with the service.i have to add that i'm probably not a sophisticated customer when it comes to the haircut ;-)
their online check in doesn't work at all unless you do it twice. ended up waiting for 45 minutes at the salon. really horrible site do to online check in. never going here again in my life. they just don't tell you how long the wait is. my recommending this place ever.
"i came here to get a haircut as i have done in the past but the experience is always the same. the only reason why i come here is because it's close to my house and i can walk there on a nice day. but i guess i just need to learn. there was no one there except for 1 hairstylist so i couldn't even pick. when she asked what i wanted i told her i wanted to trim the back of my hair to about here i didn't even get explain anything else and she just cut it right there,  whoops it's a little too late then it was all gone, as we continued she asked if i wanted to shampoo i said yes. when it came time to cutting my hair i was very specific with how i wanted it cut she paid no attention to that. asked if i wanted a blow dry and i said no my goal was to just get out of there and leave. when it came time pay , quoting me a price she quoted me the haircut price and then added five dollars for the shampoo. when i explained to her that the shampoo was included in their haircut for the price stated on the pricing board she said no that's for men only. i said no that's not for men only i've been here many times before that's the correct price ok i'll give you a discount she said. i said no you're not giving me a discount your charge me the price you're supposed to charge me. the staff is consistently inconsistent with the pricing even though there is a pricing board displayed above the register they still quote incorrect prices and try to take money from you it's completely bad business,  some of them don't even know how to cut hair i'm not sure how they got their license it's very disappointing. just because it's a discount type hair salon does it mean you should get discounted and inexperience hairstylist"
"i had a hair cut at supercuts last week. linda was super nice and gave me a great hair cut.i like the way linda cut my hair and she provided very good recommendations to take care of my hair. it was great experience, linda n. was a very nice hair stylist, she took the times to ensure i am happy with  the result. i highly recommend linda for a hair cut at supercuts."
"i just brought my adult niece into super cuts to have her hair washed and styled.  being developmentally disabled, she has a hard time explaining how she wants her hair styled, so i explain to the stylist.  she was assigned to amy.  i explained to amy the style she wanted.  amy then stepped away and spoke to two other stylists, then came back and told me that my niece would have to wait for another stylist.    no explanation as to why she was refusing service.  two other customers were taken before my niece was called.  fortunately the stylist who did provide service was very kind and patient.  i found amy's treatment of us rude, unprofessional, and demeaning."
disapointed. i waisted my time waiting i called a head of time asking if i can come in for a color ombré the assured me yes they will do it and when i got there i waited 30 min to be called once called she pretty much told me no she can't do it. didn't give me any other color options and sent me off not to mention she coulden't even show me the color option booklet!. to me it seemed like she did not want to do the coloring at all! let me just say i have been to a supper cuts and they were able to do ombré smh. disappointed and a waste of my time when i could have gone somewhere else!
"terrible.  avoid stephanie at all costs.  not only did she have an attitude, she proceeded to hit me repeatedly with her clippers.  she high-sided my head after i showed her a photo of a low fade that i requested.  ever seen full metal jacket?  similar experience.  also, they charge 20 dollars for a supercuts, which includes a hot towel wipe.  she hit me with the blow dryer and said ""i think it looks good"".20 dollars will get you a legit haircut at a barber.  don't waste your time."
i've been getting my hair cut here for many years. kathy is great and a pleasure to talk to. she has always given me the feeling that i come to a place where i am welcome and appreciated. kathy manages the place so that it does not feel at all like a chain but a neighborhood establishment.
"i had mixed experience here. last time i got haircut from azam which was pretty good. yesterday some other person (linda) has done my haircut, that turned out to be terrible. i found linda's work to be super quick but very sloppy - she didn't deliver what i wanted and whetever she delivered is of poor quality i.e. it's uneven in so many places."
unorganized place. does not honor their own priority system. they take in regular customers as walk-in. the place looks unhygenic. licenses of such a place should be revoked.
"they should name this location super""bad""cuts. the whole bunch that work here couldnt care less about doing an honest day's work, just pass their time taking breaks all the time and never prioritize online appointments. the place is incredibly dirty and the equipment looks almost unsanitary. they ignore people waiting and i've seen many times people just leave unhappy and angry."
"we've been here for an hour, waiting patiently.  the staff has been ridiculously slow and despite the fact that they had about 10 clients waiting, they still choose to waste time on small talk with departing customers.  then a guy walks in, is greeted immediately, and they take him in front of everyone else.  it wasn't until i complained loudly that i was told that we're next.  what a joke.  i no longer recommend this place because of this inexcusable customer service."
"jacky is an amazing person and she is fun and focused on her job . i went to their salon couple times and she helped me multiple times with an amazing hair color and hair cut. with having 25+years of experience i recommend you all to go to her . once you go ,you will go for ever to her"
"this was the worst day of my life. i arrive in to meet a most unfriendly ** woman who was very rude and smelled bad,she was very aggressive and not gentle. awful experience. greatly disappointed. and then the check overcharged me 65$ not sure she was qualified enough to shear sheep. save yourself from this place. yes she is manager in this place."
"hair is one of those things you shouldn't be lazy about. but when it comes time for a cut, i can always think of more fun ways to spend $60+.hence the time when i came to supercuts. i just needed a quick trim to get off the split ends as well as my roots touched up. somehow that left me $80 poorer, but given the number of terrible salon experiences i've had, i was okay with the price. my roots didn't come out totally perfect (they ended up being about an 8 1/2 instead of a 9 color) but it's not terribly noticable. as for the trim, the lady took off my split ends without ruining my layers, and i was happy enough with the results.would i come back here? ehh, i shouldn't. but i might."
"yolanda gave me a great cut. i asked for trim and taper and she was quick to understand. only negative is they push for the shampoo, massage, the products!! i had a hard time saying no to everything lol. still will come again for the nice quick hair cut."
"i was extremely thrilled w/azita's work! after years of growing out my hair and not taking very good care of it, i finally decided to just chop it off. azita did a great job turning a long rat's nest into a shoulder-length, stylish cut. i showed her a picture of what i was looking for and she took it from there (while still keeping me informed of what she was doing to my head)! she will definitely be the one to maintain it from here on out!(only reason i'm not giving this 5 stars is because the price was a little bit much... $44 for a cut, blow dry and style.  i was willing to pay it, given the state of my hair and how drastic the change was, but it's a bracing difference from the $19 trims/cuts i'm used to! azita is worth the price, but i don't know if i'd feel comfortable with it for any other stylist.)"
"this place sucks, specially on the weekends. they have hired people who have other jobs during the weekdays & really don't know how to give a hair cut. the place had edgy barbers. just weekends is a horrible place . i wish i could give them -5 stars."
"this was the worst service that i have received from a supercuts center. the stylist has had no interest in the cut. therefore, the cut has an absolute lack of basic quality. absolutely disappointed about this place."
"the service at this location is pretty bad across the board. from the time you enter, to the end of the haircut the service just sucks. no one acknowledges you on entry. app check-in and wait times mean nothing. a 0 minute wait time is more like 20 minutes. people checking in person get in ahead of your app check-ins (done 15 minutes earlier). prices are higher than other supercuts. haircuts are standard. won't be visiting again. really needs franchise management to take a look."
"this is the absolute worst place to get a haircut, i mean honestly, the only thing u can do there is purchase one of the resold branded hair-care products. and also, the staff there is deaf, and does not listen, for i just had a haircut where i had asked my barber to give me three on all sides and cut around half of the hair on the top. however, i exited the store with hair that matched a chinese monk, and now, bald with a cleanly shaved head, i beg u to not end up the position i am in, and choose a place whose staff listens to you."
"first time i've cut my hair in years at another place other than my aunts salon, didn't really know what to do with my hair, but jenny was very nice and helped me throughout the whole thing, i haven't loved my hair in a long time, i totally recommend you get ur haircut with jenny! great costumer service and haircut! :)"
"turns out kardelia does not work here anymore. she was just perfect for short hair cuts.today i went in just despite finding out kardelia no longer works there, thinking to myself... how badly can someone screw up a hair cut and then i found out. i should have figured out when she started and stopped her because it did seem like she had no clue. i would have really appreciated if she was honest and just said she has no experience.ladies should skip this place if you have short hair!"
not everyone here knows how to cut.. not a place what i was looking for...too bad for people who have curly hair.. they will make you cartoon character..
"just because they are cutting kid's hair, they feel they don't really have to pay attention. i took my daughter today for hair cut. lady who gave her hair cut was very sleepy probably. she just plainly ran her scissor in a straight line still from the back,  right side looks shorter than left. hate this place and never coming back. $16+ $2 tip, not worth it at all! i went there just because i went to target for shopping and regret my bad decision ever. my 8 yr old was sad to see her hair when it dried up. please don't go there an don't take your kids either. there are other better salons where stylists are hard working, pay attention to details and not sleepy!!"
"from what i've noticed from this place, my haircut is always a hit or a miss depending on who is cutting it. they always have different people cutting at different times of the day and some people know how to actually cut the hair and others simply just suck. it's hard to give a good gauge as to how things are. however, the one thing that i absolutely dislike about this place is the increase in prices. i've been coming to this place for years now and i remember when i first came, it was about $15. now, it's $20 for a frickin haircut. $20 is way too excessive. therefore, i'll probably not go there anymore. side note: i'm a guy so idk how the haircuts are for women."
"i was unable to wash and dry my own hair due to a surgery.  nancy was very gentle, listened to my concerns and needs and delivered better results than any highend salon i have used in the past.  my husband has been getting his hair cut here for years and honestly, it's a bargain."
"don't go to this place . they have their own ""friends"" jump the line. super rude people . worst place in america."
"i have been coming here for many years. i get consistently good work from pretty much anyone i get to cut my hair and i think that they are very reasonably priced.  they make good suggestions for your hair style when asked and they also give you good advise on how to take care of your hair afterwards.  this feels like a very neighborly place to me where the employees carr about people and they all try hard to give good service.  wait times can vary but you can leave your name and go shop nearby for a while and come back later. kardelia runs a good team and if you want some good work done for a very decent price, this is a great place to come."
"i am a regular customer at this location in the heart of cupertino, but tonight i've got the worst service ever and the highest price quoted ever to color the roots only ($65.00)!!! from the start i was hinted that i need to go to professional salon and that my color will not turn out right. then i needed to make a decision about the color to blend in. at that point all i had left is just to leave.:(("
"i went for a haircut and supercolor. i dont know the person who did my coloring. it was the worst coloring i ever had. i came back home and realized this. the color was all over my skin ( under both ears, on the forehead and all over the back on the neck). she has not bothered to apply vaseline before starting. worst job ever."
i just heard kardelia no longer works there. is this true?? does anyone know where she went? who is going to cut my hair from now?
"i don't want to write the name of the stylist here, but the work she did on my husband's hair is just horrible. he went for a trim and she trimmed his hair and also thinned them. he is practically bald now.never ever go here.."
"go ask for azita! !very  good lady  ,,good in cut, ,color  but also fix your color  as well  when  you don't like! !"
"went there as i needed a haircut and was exploring places where i can get a reasonable haircut.  the initial welcome was good, i entered my details in the computer and was asked to wait for 15 min.when my turn came. ...i explained as how i need my haircut to be done but very soon i found that the actual haircut was totally different as i explained. she made my head looks as a rounded watermilon.  worst haircut i ever had. now i need to wait till my hair grows big and go for a good haircut place.note: if someone going there...please make sure u instruct them every minute so that u get a haircut as u wanted."
"daughters hair all broke off from a keratin treatment and then i saw her brush it out and pulled it and brushed it so hard. it was awful. i had to stand up. a few times in the beginning i was just going to walk straight out because of the vibe and the haughtiness the young asian beautician displayed but i thought maybe it will be ok. always go with your instinct. 30% of her hair is now gone and broken off all on top so it looks like it sticks up. so sad. she had luxurious hair and now it's thin. :( the 1st time an older woman did it and did a great job. this time, won't be back."
"kudos to brianna. she does such an awesome job. she cuts all the boys hair, and my mans. she is attentive and always very communicative with us on styling. i can say she is really good with ethnic hair, because my boys hair is very coarse and has a tendency to stand straight up, but she has done a great job with styling in the latest fashion trend. we have been going here and will continue to show her our loyalty."
i'm not one to give bad reviews but i think this was the worst place i've ever gone to get a haircut. i came in pretty positive trusting the people there with giving a decent haircut but i really over estimated them. the end result was terrible. i hate my hair now. i told the lady clear instructions on what i wanted and what my usual hairstyle was. she went completely opposite of what i wanted. so terrible. so ugly. i will never go here again. i definitely won't be recommending this place to anyone. $20 for a shitty ass haircut. goodbye.
i love it. last time i went to get my hair cut the lady cut off way to much (i just wanted a trim)here i was a little nervous because the lady didn't speak good english.  but me and my bf got our hair cut and they turned out great. they didn't cut to much off the lines on mine look nice. if you come here just make sure you explain everything and they understand i'm sure you'll leave happy.
"first off, they tell me thirty minutes wait until the next haircut, that's fine, an hour and 15 passes. secondly, my hair dresser, hien, was terrible. first off, she was rude and super abrupt. i told her i wanted a disconnected undercut but to fade from a 2 to a 3. say she understands. when she starts cutting, the haircut feels weird, so i ask to look, it looks terrible. she says she's not done. i let her do what she wants. proceeds to use the razor and constantly bumps my head with it while cutting. i just get it over with. once she gets to the fade, she tells me that the hair is weird and that she will have to fade it, that's what i wanted in the first place. in the end, i just want to be out from what terrible service i have received. i check my own hair, it looks terrible. while there is apparent that there was a change in razor sizes from two to three, its not faded at all. the top back of my hair is basically a mushroom cap. since i had asked to not touch the front, the front looks fine. overall, a terrible job and won't be coming back. not worth $20."
"ladies steer clear of this salon. it seems as though they specialize in men's haircuts. i should have known better to come here when i noticed there were only male customers. i came here to get a little trim, preparing for professional photos that are being taken at my new job in a few days. i told the stylist i wanted a trim and to keep the style, including my bangs. i showed her a photo of how i wanted my bangs. she cut way too much to where i feel like i hardly have any hair left. she tried to blend my bangs with the hair in front, like taper it. it doesn't blend at all. she just cut way too much. when blending it like that it shouldn't be super noticeable. also, i asked that she only trim my bangs and to have them at eyebrow length. i already had them, they were just a little too long. she started snipping away and then stepped back to look at them, when i saw in the mirror what she had done i wanted to run out right then. i told her they were uneven. she kept trying to fix them and i finally had to stop her. they look terrible and they're too short to pin back.  i feel so embarrassed and self conscious. it took everything in me to hold back the tears. on top of it all i have to have my photos taken at work soon with this hair. i will never visit a supercuts again."
"i just found out that my stylist of many years, song, retired. she had consistently given me the best haircut and was someone i looked forward to visiting. i'll miss you song! congratulations on your retirement... you deserve the best!"
"i had a great first impression.i've never been to a supercuts before and i didn't know what to expect. i decided to go early in the morning to avoid waiting too long, it was a good call. the lady who cut my hair was very friendly and the wash was amazing! i definitely want to come back, just to get my hair washed. and of course she did a great job cutting my hair. i was very satisfied with the place and the service, this will now be my go to place."
"i won't complain about the staff as a person, super friendly.  but my goodness, my stylist shouldn't cut hairs..... it was uneven and left a square tail on the end of my hair."
"got a quick haircut here and she did a great job. quick and clean, no drama or hatred. somewhat expensive for men's haircut but recommend this place. my hair stylist i think name dung is pretty looking too."
i always get the same lady i don't remember her name but she is asian and has short hair. it's always a nice convo along with a nice hair cut. she's so friendly. i like this location even though i live downtown and there are closer ones. they know what they're doing here. make an app because they get really busy!
"i've been going to atelier in santana row, but the stylists there charge $60 + for the cut/styling that are not that great nor complimentary to my look (casual professional).  so i was looking for a new hair salon to get my shoulder length hair trimmed and slightly textured (but not too seared) at the bottom so that it would curl in when i style and not bulk out.  today, i got exactly that when i came to supercuts that was close to where i was shopping things.  my stylist kathy was very pleasant, attentive, and professional about cutting my hair.  she had a pleasant manner in conversing with me while she cut and styled my hair.  she also dried and styled my hair without charging any extra.  for $17 + tip (she really deserved it too), i walked out looking a lot better than i did a few months ago after a cut at atelier, and much happier and more satisfied with the customer service.  i will go back to this supercuts to have kathy do my hair again."
"supercuts are hit and miss in general, so it takes a fantastic stylist to get me to go back time after time.  haylee is consistently nailing it with her haircuts!  she takes her time and does it right.  not to mention she is always on a pleasant mood and genuinely wants to you enjoy your haircut.  wait times can be rough at this location, so be sure to call ahead to check in on their app."
went in for cut and colorstylist was super nice meticulous and did an extraordinary job !
"went and got a hair cut from then a week ago, got a hair that were not even so went back 5 days later asking them to fix and they but charging me full price of the hair. should they fixing it for free, you would think so right but not. end customer not happy with hair then charge again to fix it."
"out of all the salons/barbershops i've been to, this is the worst. it took the staff an hour and 15 minutes to get through 3 customers. so, i'm waiting for awhile now, and one of the employees comes in and clocks on, and she clearly sees people waiting for their turn. however, she just ignores us and chats with the other employees for a good 30 minutes. finally, she decides to work and she's decides to cut my hair. great, i can get my goods done. i ask her for simple number 1 fade comb over. instead she barely touches the top of my hair, and gives me buzz cut on my sides. i was clearly dissatisfied with her work, and when she notices, she gives me attitude and says i should've downloaded the app and made a reservation. like cmon dude, i'm kind enough to not complain about the $20 shit haircut, but you tell me i should've known better? honestly never coming back to this place. overall, this place is overpriced for a haircut, you'd be better off growing out your hair than coming here."
"do not get your hair cut by song. you tell her to cut it one way and she cuts it however she feels like cutting it. i look like an idiot. she cut my hair like she hated my whole family. i'd rather shave my head with a dull rock than walk around with this hair cut she gave me. i can't believe how bad my haircut is. i could of give my friends new born baby two samurai swords and she probably could of cut it better than song. if you do plan on going to song for a hair cut, i'd recommend setting your hair on fire and putting it out really fast. it would save you 17 dollars."
"asked how long was the wait said 15 min which was not bad, i told the lady i'll back back in 10min she said ok. i came back saw she was about to be done, but she went on break her name is liz. i saw another lady was about to be done with another customer so i waited another five minute found out she was off. as i was waiting all this time only customer left no one said anything. from 15min i had to wait 30min just to fine out after i went up and ask what was going on to wait another 15min. lady she said sorry i'm the only one. 45 min to get a hair cut at supercuts. all they had to do was say from the beginning or anytime that it will be 45 min wait. worst service ever.."
"nvm there's red in my hair, doesn't look bad. and whenever i wash my hair, my fingernails are filled with black dyed skin flakes... not sure if i've seen it like this before since i dyed hair multiple times and it never came out flakey. butttt it's okay my trim was still nice, will come back for the cuts"
"wanted to write a quick review. walked in and was seen within 15 minutes, chin did my hair, he was kind and very welcoming! we talked for a while as he cut my hair and i had full trust in him cutting my hair! i've had the same girl cut and color my hair for 5 years now, so the fact that he made me feel comfortable is great.!bottom line he's been with the company for 10 years and did a great job with my hair.! i will return to see him again.!"
"super arrogant and rude! the person who did the haircut on my wife! i asked if she could blow-dry and in some way show  the haircut style, she answered rudely saying it was not my hair,  & it only mattered if my wife liked it. when i said to remove us from their system she said it didn't matter to her, that for every bad client that leaves she gets three good ones. liz is her name she said, & that she didn't care about the bad reviews, we've been customers since this location opened, sadly this was a very bad experience and won't be back, this person doesn't know how to treat people"
"good place for quick and clean haircut. my man dj will cut your hair fast and clean, and with not mistakes.i hate taking forever getting a haircut. that's why i always ask for dj. clean, fresh, and always perfect!"
the waiting times are ridiculous. i came in at 4:00 waited until 4:42 just to be cut my 3 because other people called
"if you're a guy with pretty straightforward hair whether old or young, these people can probably give you a decent cut.  i know a couple of guys that go here all the time and they look like normal humans when they emerge. or if you are a child with perfectly straight hair and you're asking them to cut a straight line across the back, they might do an ok job.however- if you are a female do not do it.  you will regret it.  i gave these people three chances over a two year period with my perfectly normal straight hair.  my hair is absolutely nothing difficult, and all three times they truly butchered it.  this last time was the worst.  i can honestly say it looks like an angry cat gnawed and chewed at my hair!!  no joke.  she even blow dried it for thirty minutes, and kept adding spray and gel over and over so that when i looked in the mirror it looked ok.  as soon as i got in the car and moved my head i saw that she was using the ten pounds of gel and blow dryer to shape my hair, almost like it's play doh, into looking normal.  not only that but she used the shearing scissors and completely, and i mean completely ruined my hair - in fact i cannot even get it fixed because it's so uneven that i have to wait for it to grow for a few months.  she also somehow charged me 60.00 for this cut.  go to his and hers hair bar across the street.  they won't upsell, give you a free drink and do a beautiful job on your hair."
"i've been going to supercuts having beatriz cut and/or color my hair for 1 year now (like 1-2x a month haha) :) so wanted to give an updated review. i refuse to go anywhere else!!! it's more affordable than the top notch salons and beatriz does such an amazing job, i feel like i got top notch service!!! i've lived in cali for 8 years and couldn't find anyone i was satisfied with until now! she always listens to what i want and gets it right every time and with a very friendly and professional attitude. i am always in and out quicker than i have ever been anywhere else so it's not that time consuming which is great because setting at a salon 3-4 hours is tiring."
"beatriz always cuts my hair, shes amazing, go to beatriz you will not be disappointed!!!!"
they always do great cuts for us and are always friendly. we like a special cut for my son and they always do it right. we are happy going there.
"i made an appointment to get my haircut at 4pm yesterday. i decided to give them a try since i was in the area. i got there around 3:50pm. they greeted me and asked me to sit and wait. within the next 10 mins, 2 more people came. finally, one of the lady finished the person she was working on and called a white man up. knowing i had made an appointment and he was a walkin. she looked at her coworker and spoke in vietnamese saying can someone take me cause she took the white guy since she didnt want him to wait...it went back and forth between her and the 2 coworkers...it was 4:15 by now..i got annoyed and spoke to them in both english and vietnamese (shocking them that im viet) how unprofessional they are. i felt had i been white, i may have actually got my appointment the time i made it for. i find it very unprofessional of people to speak in their native language while having clients that don't understand what they are saying. all in all, id save my money and time and find anther place.sent from my iphone"
i received the most hideous hair cut by a women who obviously couldn't understand english.  i asked for a trim (2 inches)  this woman cut 5 to 6 inches off.  when i told her she didn't understand what it was i wanted she said ih well 18.95.  i was blown away by her attitude and by the haircut i received.  her station is the first one on the right.  don't get your hair cut by her she is totally unprofessional and doesn't know how to cut hair!
call ahead and good luck trying to get your scheduled time. not sure why they tell you a time.
"i not to picky about my hair; most times i wear a ball cap and keep my hair pretty short, but the hack job i got today is unbelievable.  when i was 4 years old and gave myself a haircut i probably did a better job.  there are random long patches and short patches along the sides of my head that were obvious once i got home and looked closely in the mirror. i'm not being picky either the differences in hair lenth are greater than half an inch; and up to an inch in some placesi not sure of her name but if a younger spanish lady with tattoos tries cutting your hair, run."
"do not go to supercuts to get highlights or foil lightening! i got a melt done back in may at a great salon and went to supercuts to try and get it touched up for a better price. when i told her what i got done and exactly how it was done at my previous salon, she said she could do it and started to apply the bleach. when she rinsed it out i was greeted with the most hideous edges i've ever seen. she took no time to blend my highlighted hair in with my natural hair. i asked if she could dye the roots to fade the highlights better and initially she said no, but then changed her mind when she saw how unhappy i was with my hair. when she was finishing up the dye, she explained to me how supercuts couldn't do what i wanted with my hair at this location. i would have been okay if i couldn't have gotten what i wanted done if i would have been informed of it before she started bleaching my hair. she at least tried to make it right with dying it but i'll be making an appointment with my regular salon to get it fixed anyway because it's still not exactly what i wanted and when the dye washes out my roots will look hideous. in addition, a different lady gave me a trim and asked if i wanted 2 inches off. i said no and i wanted 1/2 inch off only (showed her with my fingers too). she completely disregarded that and cut off 2 inches anyway. overall, mediocre skills and terrible communication. pictures are attached of the highlights before and after the dye was added. i'd be embarrassed to call myself a hair stylist if i was giving that kind of service to others."
i love this branch. been coming here for over a decade. the ladies are kind and do always do a great job. always book appointment via telephone or website as they get very busy. be patient they are worth it.
"you really get what you pay for. haircuts here are cheaper & i think are a greater option for men than it is for women. i do not remember the person who cut my hair but my experience here was just alright. i always get lured into getting cheap haircuts & then afterward regret that i did because the experience just feels very unenjoyable. you don't get your hair washed or shampooed, no styling & the technique in their cuts seem to emphasize timeliness rather than quality. i've never had my hair colored here but i'd honestly be scared to."
"i've been going here for 7 years, but never again! i've made appts. in the past and had to wait a little bit while they finished up the prior customer, but today was different. i made a phone appt. with helen and got there on time to find that she had just taken a young kid (by the looks of it, a few mins earlier). i was acknowledged by her when i walked in and then made to wait for 25mins(!), while she spent an exorbitant amount of time trimming up his buzz cut and washing his hair. nothing else was ever said by anyone there with regards to my having to wait so long. i finally left without saying a word.to top it off, even though i have been going to helen for much of this time, my haircuts have been inconsistent at best. i go as a matter on convenience, but i really have to pay attention to make sure i get a decent haircut.don't waste your time or money at this location."
great cuts from all the crew at this place.  no rush service and attention to detail. bummed that vi (vee) has moved on. she gave me the best cut i have ever had.  hopefully her departure is temporary.
"i had the worst service here. i came in just to get my hair washed because i broke my arm pretty badly. seemed simple enough, but i was very wrong. after waiting 40 minutes, the woman finally took me to the back, i told her i just wanted my hair washed and braided because of my arm and she said she didn't know how to braid. she then went to take my hair out of the pony tail, she couldn't and i told her to just cut the hair tie because it wasn't worth it and she cut my hair instead of the tie. she told me that new management meant that she could only do everything in 5 minutes and that i should get a keratin treatment instead. after washing my hair, she brought me to the chair and started brushing my hair instead of combing it. just the top layer was brushed and she went to put it in a pony tail and i said i wanted it higher and felt my hair and it was still so tangled. after all that, i had to do comb my hair one handed and finished it at home. i left so upset. would not recommend this place to anyone."
"i got my hair cut by vee. she did a great job, was very polite, and took her time. was very satisfied by her attention to detail and making sure i was completely happy with my cut. will definately come back to get my hair cut from her."
i received the worst hair cut in my life by a woman who does not understand english and does not know what she was doing i have asked for 4 and she cut too short and they keep laughing with each other when i said that this is not right and worst part is i had to pay $18 for for such ugly hair cut they do. i could have given zero if yelp allowed me. save your money and hair by going to some other place
"horrible service. let's others cut in line, even after having booked online. will not be returning again. thankfully another supercuts has just opened up close by."
decided to try supercuts one more time. made an appointment ahead of time. came to the location and i was promptly greeted by staff. my stylist was friendly and very detailed in her work. she made sure i got what i asked for and i appreciate the time she took to ensure my hair was cut properly. i will be coming back to this location again.
"the only reason i am leaving a review is because of the new stylist katlyn. katlyn started about 6 weeks ago and i just happen to end up with her one day when i dropped in for a quick haircut. the last 3 haircuts have been outstanding! she listens and asks questions in an effort to get your haircut right. i reccomend the tea tree service as well with her. let's be honest, supercuts in general is a crapshoot for a good haircut. that said, when you find someone good it's a bonus."
"be prepared to wait for quite some time almost all days of the week. on weekend the wait time is really high. this supercuts is located in the rivermark plaza near the safeway. i have been a couple of times here. this seems to be quite a busy location and the wait time is typically around 20-30 minutes. also i am quite disappointed with the final result of my haircut. i have tried two different stylists on two different occasions and on both the occasions the haircut length was way shorted than i instructed/asked for. and unlike a bad experience in a restaurant, you can't get your hair back (compare with sending your food back). so maybe from next time i will try a different place. i waited for two visits before posting this so that the review doesn't look like a knee-jerk reaction from a singular visit."
"feel compelled to leave a 1 star review because i had the absolute worst experience. i wanted to trim my split ends as my hair is growing long. the lady didn't seem to understand my 'please don't cut it too short, keep the original shape', and forced 'a style' on me. she chopped off so much hair that at one point i literally asked her to stop cutting my hair. her style turned out to be hideous, lucky me that i put my hair up in a bun most of the time. i am never going back to supercuts. this is a great place for guys - a lot of my guy friends go there frequently and their hair come out fine. just not for gals. especially not if your hair is long."
i went to get my hair done here because caitlin started working here.  she's amazing and awesome at what she does.  she has over 25 years experience and is always updated to the current fashion.  i'll follow her wherever she works.  she listens to what type of haircut you want and trust me whatever it is you'll be very happy with it.  thanks again caitlin!! see you soon.  don't forget ask for caitlin!  you will thank me!!
"this was a horrible experience. the stylist did a very bad job of trimming my hair. she trimmed more than what i had asked for.  i wasn't even sure she was understanding what i'm saying since she just kept nodding her head. after the trimming, she didn't even bother to blow the strands of hair from my face. i had to ask her to do it later which caused all the strands to fall on my shirt! the old staff was nowhere to be found. looks like all the good staff has moved to better locations. i would be never going to this place anymore."
i came to this supercuts in santa clara a couple of weeks ago because my hair stylist --- caitlin --- transferred to this location.  caitlin is an amazing stylist and she cut my hair exactly the way i wanted it.  i didn't even mind the extra miles i had to drive to get there because i knew that the cut caitlin was going to give me would be worth it.  and i was right!  ask for caitlin when you go to this supercuts......you will be glad you did!-mizz chris from san mateo
"where is cody? inquiring minds need to know. i liked the other guy's (dane?) work also. unfortunately i put my kids name on the list for him and when my family arrived he was working on another client and took like 40 mins to complete that. we waited and ended up having one kid go to another stylist and the other went to him. i was willing to give him another chance because i witnessed his work on several occasions and it was very good, and he apologized. however, he is no longer there either. i went to the super cuts on holger partially because i was hoping to find them lol. no such luck. without cody this is just a dusty, outdated location with bad parking. i will just go to the other location to get my little kids a decent haircut until i find something else."
"i will not recommend this store to anyone.i went there today for haircut. i showed them a picture for reference (those employees somehow don't understand english). woman who was cutting my hair was very rude. i asked her why she is talking rudely and she said it's a bad day for her (why talk rudely then).she cut my hair very short than i asked for and when i questioned her about that, she said because she accidently cut some hair short and covered it cutting remaining hair short (ridiculous).also, she was cutting hair so harshly that once or twice her scissor hurt my head.plz don't go to this store. they'll ruin your hair.edit: i went home and checked backside of my head. it was looking messy. i had to trim it by myself to make it look better. i've attached photo of how it looked post haircut."
"there must have been an ownership change at this location.  since they got rid of all the old stylist and brought in new people.  i've been coming here for the past 7 years and getting my hair cut by cody.  however, his no longer there as are the other familiar faces that i used to see.  everybody there is all new.  based on the cut i received, they must have all just graduated from supercuts training program with zero experience.    i would never go back to this supercuts.  for the past 7 years, the days that cody worked (tues to sat), there were always a wait with waiting area full, now, no matter what time you go by, they are empty.  no wait what so ever.  that tells you something, they are loosing business left and right from people like me.  new management at this location deserves to loose all of their old customers when they discharged all of their experienced stylist."
first of all i give one star because i just lost two of my best stylist. i came in today and find out that two of my best stylist are no longer working at this location. i have been going to kathy and cody bui for sometime now. every time i come in to town i always stop by to either see kat or cody they are excellent with there craft. i also wonder why they stay so long at this location and not start something on there own but they always say they care about the people they work with . i just want to thank them for all those wonderful haircuts sorry supercuts i will never come back to this location again.
"this place is hard to beat for fast, cheap, and decent haircuts and beard trims. is this going to be the most amazing spa experience of your life? nope? best haircut ever? not likely. but for a decent, affordable cut this place is good. the stylists are competent and friendly."
"i went to this place because it is near where i visit my parents.  christine cut my hair and was an expert. i have long hair and needed it cut with a bit of a layer, and she not only did an excellent job but was also very pleasant. i have to give her thumbs up, since she really deserves it.  thank you, christine!"
"the lady cut me up and didn't want to let me see the back of my neck the two times she had me look back at it , i don't understand why she couldn't just be honest with me and i would understand her but the fact that she gripped on to my shirt twice to cover it is not okay and i understand she messed up but that's more messed up of me to get talked into buying their product and getting cut up."
was referred by a friend to go here and get an appointment with cody. really friendly guy. he knew what i wanted before telling him and i loved the result. will definitely go back.
"i have been coming here for years. still great, still affordable. worth the wait. thank you for your superb customer service kathy! love my a-line bob."
"another crappy experience- called yesterday and the lady told me that my stylist will be tomorrow and i can call tomorrow to set up an appointment. i called today and i was told that they are not taking appointments anymore because they are booked, but i can still come in and wait in line...."
great place for a haircut. cody gave me a much needed wonderful haircut and after care recommendations. thanks cody!
"i had my haircut done by cody and in all my years of having my hair done at salons (even high-end), this has been by far my best.  cody didn't make me feel like i was just another customer at supercuts and he was conscious about the concerns i had with my hair to the point that i left with tears of happiness!  my experience was great and i will definitely be coming back to cody. -lucy"
being going to this place for few months. cody is the  best at what he does. he takes so much care and everytime i visit here he gives me a new look. i highly recommend this place.
"i will definitely be back. everyone who works there has tons of regular customers. i can see why. i popped in for a haircut before the lunch rush, and it's one of the best, most reasonably priced haircuts i've ever had, and i used to work in the hair products business. if you come in knowing what you want, and you communicate that to their stylists, you'll be happy."
