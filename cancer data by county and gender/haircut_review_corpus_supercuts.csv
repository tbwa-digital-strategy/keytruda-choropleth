"i went on a saturday and waited maybe 10 minutes.  i had never been to the ashland and  wellington location, but had avoided supercuts for several years after a bad experience at a different location.  i took a shot at this one and received the best haircut i can remember.  even my fiance commented how nice it was.  piedad (pili) did a wonderful job, took her time and was attentive to the details.  i'm usually not that picky about my haircuts, so i typically just walk in and take the ealier available stylist.  i will be making appointments with piedad (pili) for my haircuts from now on."
lorie is one of the best stylists around. i am surprised that she is not at a top salon. she has absolutely given me the best haircuts always!
"the salon is nice and clean, and that's about it. my hair cut was nothing like i explained, nothing like the stylist said she will do, and last but not least nothing like the picture i showed her. i went for a haircut, the lady seemed nice, but... i showed her a picture of how i wanted my haircut to look, tho she made a remark that she didint like long hair on me, i thought it wasn't any of her business. well, she cut away my hair  and to my surprise it was so short!  i only went for a ""trim""and shapeup not an entire haircut. the haircut she gave me was the one she wanted not the one i asked for! looks nothing like the picture i showed her. i would not recommend this place, because you should get the haircut you ask for and not the one the person cutting hair wants. too bad i can't give them zero stars.  never going back."
"although fairly early till a wait time, for minimal cut bang trim, check-in app not working properly disappointed very much so."
"delois is a superstar! i originally went to an aveda salon to get my hair trimmed. i left with choppy, uneven facial layers!? i ran to super cuts around the corner and told delois my story. not only did she sit me down then & there. she fixed the horrible mess that someone else created. i know it's hard to fix a bad cut.. but she did :)very friendly staff. will continue to go here from now on!"
i have been going here for about a year . i have used a couple different  people .none bad . pele is the best !!!!! i call in advance to make sure she is available .
i went there last week. i hate it. she doesn't know how to cut hair and i paid $40 bad haircut ever !!!! not recommend!'
"i should have known better than to think that a $15 haircut was going to make me look like i got a $75 one.... lesson learned!  i came here on a random sunday and there was no one in the store... that should have been red flag number one considering it sits in the middle of a strip mall.  but i ignored this and talked to the lady at the front counter, she was young and seemed to know what she was talking about.  i asked for a trim because i like the length of my hair and so she started cutting.  i told her my hair was straightened but that i'm naturally curly, she said she needed to cut my hair while it was straight because it would be harder to get the cut i want if she cut it after she shampooed my hair... (flag #2 -- wth was she talking about, 'cut i wanted'  it was a trim!)  yes i have a few layers in my hair but its not that complicated to the ladies at regis, they always cut my hair after shampoo with no trouble at all and it looks great!  so onto the cut, which was a lot of fluffing up my hair and snip, and fluff and snip, and fluff and snip, etc.  at the end of ten minutes she was done... i looked at it and saw that it looked exactly the same as it did when i came in... and not any shorter, i seriously didn't see a difference.  i asked her if she could cut it more, give me more layers and... fluff and snip, fluff and snip... and voila, same sh**.  so basically, i left the store with the same cut i had, not any shorter and i examined my ends... and guess what, i still had split ends!  a good sylist would have told me she needed to cut down x amount of hair to remove the split ends and would have had noticeable layers.  my hair looks dull, long and out of shape.  never again!"
"went in for a haircut, and when i got home, noticed that it was quite a bit shorter on one side than the other. went back to get it fixed by a different stylist, and she also cut it unevenly. then, when i pointed out that one side was still longer than the other, she agreed, but seemed quite confused that i would want my hair to be the same length on both sides. never going back."
"i am only giving it one stars because the place was clean and the girls where nice, but everything else was horrible. this was my second time here once i sat on the chair the l stylist complained about how long and heavy my hair was. i asked her no not cut too much off the length and she didn't. she kept on complaining on how bad it was cut when little did she know she was the last one that cut it. i decided not to tell her anything because it could have just been that my hair grew out weird. after she finished the back she was supposed to cut the from layers and she had a fit saying that i had no layers and who ever cut it last just cut it in two lengths. she chopped at random pieces of my hair and when she noticed it was getting full she was like okay all done have a great day. i don't like so cute my hair for this reason. my hair ! when i put all of my hair in the front of my shoulders the front is longer. i will never come back here again and i am definitely not going to recommend it to no one. i am so upset of how my hair ended"
brought my son in for an 11.95 haircut and walked out a happy camper. we were in and out quickly and the lady who did his hair was a sweety pie. no complaints here.
"first, i want to preface by saying i understand it's a matter of who, and not where, you get your hair cut, but i just got one of the worst cuts i've had in years at supercuts.  i'm actually really laid back about my hair, but i have a few things i know i like.  i just went in for a trim, and although i explained exactly what i wanted a few times, the woman clearly didn't listen, as i watched her do exactly what i'd asked her not to.  at one point, she actually grabbed one section of hair + held it for a while, scissors hovering, saying ""hmm...how am i gonna go at this?"" while i looked on in horror.  in the end, i came out with a chop job that looks like 3 different cuts rolled into one....and all i wanted was a trim.i would say that if you do go here, make sure you know who you're getting as a stylist.  i think i'll have to find a new place to go tomorrow to get this mess fixed, now."
i've been to the various discount hair salons in lake view and lincoln park and i feel that this one by far is the best. the location is clean and i feel the staff is courteous efficient and do a very good job. i have 2 regular persons who cut my hair here and they always do an excellent job. i'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this location.
"people buy from people, not from businesses. that is the reason i go to this super cuts about every three weeks to get a trim. there is a very talented hair guy there named lauro who told me the first time i visited, "" ....i make you look sexy, ok?"", and he does consistently every time. i had been going to a few salons downtown and just thought one day, ""why am i paying $60-$80 for a hair cut when i wear my hair so short."" i'm literally in the chair for 10 minutes tops. my hair always looks the same and i never get the free beer or champagne i see all the girls drinking when they are doing a dye job or something.this super cuts is located in a big shopping center, neighbors to pier 1 and jewel. parking is easy and readily available. it's just like another super cuts in the city and you sometimes have to wait for a chair. no use making an appointment as it has never made a difference in my wait time. i'm not a big fan of the super cuts coprorate policy that they should not keep the customer in the chair for too long. where this may maximize profitability for the franchise, the customers end up having the same haircut and does not allow the hair dresser artistic freedom. i once asked an employee at another locating why this was. they told me that much like the pizza hut guy is taught how to make pizza that are consistant every time, the ""hair cut school"" teaches you one or two ways to cut hair. this way quality can be controlled and maintained corporate wide. the first thing asked as you sit in the chair and they drape the big plastic apron over you is ""what number"". this means what number would you like your hair cut today. if you are a super cuts customer you will know what i mean.lauro is cool and will take his time, really pay attention to how you request your hair cut, and actually make you look your best. tell lauro i sent you."
this place cracks me up.  why do i keep going there?  i have no idea.  every time my hubby and i go get a hair cut we get someone else who doesn't speak english.  you neame it and they speak it.  my hubby wanted a faux hawk and got a mohawk lol.  then i wanted a graduated bob and now i have a 8 year old girl bob.  the whole time the girl was cutting my hair she kept telling me how hot my husband was (after she asked if he was my son i might add) which i felt very uncomfortable about.  we are only 7 years apart and i am not that old!  i need to find a new place.
"i stopped into this supercuts for a quick eyebrow waxing. the place my friend recommended (paris nails...right across the street from me) was closed...and my brows needed help! these places are always risky, but i was willing to give it a try. i stuck out like a sore thumb being the only female waiting for service. well, the risk paid off-the woman did a great job on my brows. she didn't over wax and she was quick. plus it only cost $8. can't beat that!"
"i could not believe the service i received today.  aprile, my stylist, asked me what i wanted.  i asked for a 3 on the sides and the back, and to have it blended in as i wanted to keep the length on top.  she proceeded to give me a 3 on the sides and the back, but when i excepted her to begin to blend it in, she began cutting a large amount of hair off the top.  i asked her if she could not cut so much off and then she looked at me blankly.  she said it would look weird if the top was longer.  i explained that with my coarse hair, if the top was cut too short, it would stand straight up.  she then continued to work and by the end of it, i just wanted to leave and assess the damage myself.  when i came home and rinsed my hair, i noticed that the top of my hair was clearly uneven.  there was a noticeable slant in my hair.  i am appalled.  this looks terrible.  and the thing is, this is my third attempt with aprile.  the other two occasions, i asked for similar hairstyles with explicit instructions, and she proceeds to give me a 13 year old boy's summer hair cut.  i gave her three chances and she struck out.  i am extremely upset and embarrassed at the result of my visit today.  it is like she's never cut hair before or knows how to follow instructions.  i tried very hard not to give her any attitude, but i was very frustrated and cannot believe that i paid full price plus tip only to sit at home and attempt to fix my hair."
"i have gone to ""cheap"" salons before with no problems most my life. i just created a yelp account just so i may warn people against this place and a women named delouse. i just got the worst f-ing hair cut of my life. first off i am use to more back and fourth before the scissors start clipping. i had to say long layers four times and she never asked how much i want off. i had to stop here after her first cut to show her. at that point its now to late. i asked for a simple layer and a swoop across my bangs. after that she started cutting again going on and on about how i have to keep my hair healthy and saying my hair was thin and dry that's why it was tangling in her comb. my hair is not thin or dry. she was snatching me bald is what she was doing. i was raised by a single father i am not tender headed. now its time for my bangs she sprayed me in the face with water twice like i was a cat on the drapes. she did one big snip and i was done. i have no layers she only cut out the center of my pre-existing bang leaving out the sides of them. i can see the scissor marks in my hair like i had cut it myself. so now not only do i have a poor excuse for a hair cut but i look like i am a kindergarten er that got bored and went at my hair with blue safety scissors. you may ask why i did not stop her or why i didn't ask to have it fixed. i didn't because i don't think any of the women in that place could have done better. my sister and a friend was there with me. they received disappointing hair cuts as well. my sister who is much boss yer then me was correcting the girl who was cutting her hair like it was training. save your self some time and money drive a few more blocks and find another cheap quick place to get your hair cut. once again i have never had a problem with ""cheap"" salons but this one is god awful and i really do hope it goes out of business."
"wow, that's interesting. it certainly never applied to the supercuts at lincoln & peterson, where i first encountered my now-regular hairdresser.  i know that franchise businesses have to maintain a certain ""uniformity of product"" but i was never asked to name a ""number""from a list of standard haircuts. on the contrary, my beautician studied my face and head structure and cut my hair so as to be the most flattering, just like an ""upscale"" hairdresser.  maybe the pressure to conform to a corporate image drove her (and some other good ones i used to encounter at s.c.) to finally open up her own place."
"i got a surprisingly awesome trim here -- on a sunday when no one else was open.  they did an awesome job for $13.  i'll definatly come back.  i'm such a hair snob too, so finally -- something cheap and they did great work.  i wouldn't ask them to style my hair, but for a cheap refresher -- absoultely"
"i'm actually really surprised at the bad reviews here. i've been to this location for my past two haircuts and had pretty good experiences each time. good haircut, fair price, really friendly customer interaction. i will come back. i did, though, really like the last haircut i got."
this place is only good for a trim. which i've came to this location multiple times but decided  to get a cut. it's not great. the hair dresser was a bit stubborn and preferred to cut the way he thought was best even when i told him what i wanted. now i'll probably go to an actual salon to fix this.
"i must be honest and say that i did not start off with a great experience here with damian, but it was quickly turned around within 24 hours!  to start, angela was amazing and promptly fixed my hairstyle. then, vanessa, the owner, reached out to me personally to hear my concerns about my first experience.  she was very friendly about the matter and i feel as though she truly listened to what i had to say. it means a lot when the owner personally reaches out to make sure there is an acceptable solution to an issue. i will definitely be returning and will be sure to see angela for any future hair appointments!"
"i have no complaints about my haircut with sahara. she taught me how to take care of my hair properly and showed me products to consider buying but was not pushy with sales at all. she was super helpful, gave a great cut and i would definitely return to her for haircuts in the future."
"ruined my boyfriend's hair, didn't know how to fade, didn't know how to part, basically parted his hair twice, dont go here, and if you do, dont go to damien !"
"so, i just got the most amazing haircut ever. i have pretty complicated hair (thanks mom) but i got lucky and i got bianca and she took my curls from limp and boring to va va voom! i don't like getting my hair cut as i've had so many bad cuts in the past, but bianca surpassed my expectations.  now i'm going out to show off this hair!  and i'm going back for a color next week. haaaay. i highly recommend this salon, and bianca does a phenomenal job. thank you guys"
"nothing amazing but i can usually walk in after work and still be served pretty quickly. they also send out monthly coupons that take a couple bucks off. sometimes you will get a warm towel at the end, but not always."
"i'm surprised with the negative reviews, but many were from more than six years ago.  i saw complaints regarding other clients being taken first.  i suppose you weren't told to call when you're on the way and you'll be taken before any walk-ins.   simple.  i saw complaints about no shampoo or having it barely damp.  a shampoo is only a few dollars, but choose what you'd like.  there is no charge for using styling products.a good stylist knows your hair and what they can or cannot achieve.  and will let you know.  and will still try!  we know that!marlene and luz are the best!  luz went to s. mich, in case anyone wonders.  you can't go wrong with either."
"it is time someone updates the reviews for this place. what a mistake it was to come here. i came in on a  night that had a bad snow storm and to my surprise it was busy. i sat and waited while the 2 hairstylist finished up cuts and took other before me. they do not wash your hair and barley get it wet. the lady who cut my hair had no idea what she was doing. she said at one point, ""i am trying to figure out how to add layers!"" umm what?!?!? basic things you should know how to do. i left with a bad trim that will take me months to fix the crappy job she did.  what a waste of money this place was. bad trim and inside is so outdated."
"the management at supercuts  is very unprofessional.  they do not schedule appointments.   they do take ""reservations"" 45 minutes beforehand, but that does not guarantee you any service at a particular time.  explain that one.  a stylist here cut my hair three times in one year.  she did an absolutely  fantastic job.  then one day, she was gone.  (it is obvious now, especially after reading these reviews, that she took her talents to a more deserving salon.) after she left, i naively asked where she went.  they wouldn't say.  i asked her last name.  they also withheld this, claiming they don't share ""personal"" information for safety purposes.  that is plain bull because if i had the foresight, i would have asked her during my last haircut and she no doubt would have told me.  it was clear that supercuts wanted to keep my business for themselves.the manger assured me the other stylists were great.  i gave one a chance.  utter disaster. so long, supercuts.  you have shot yourself in the foot. to tessa the awesome stylist: if you are reading this, please post some kind of info here, that your loyal clients can bring you their business."
"i went to this location for a while for my haircuts.  the price is definitely right.if you are looking for a stylist that is going to wash your hair, give you a scalp, massage, chat about their weekend, and/or tell you how they are going to cut your hair, this is not your place.what you will get is a reasonably priced haircut and they will try to do exactly what you tell them.i stopped going here simply because i like the conversation and the ""honey, no...we're not doing that"" when i go...i need a little more intimacy, if someone's going to be man-handling my head.  :)"
"i've been coming to this supercuts location for over 15 years.... but today i had andrea for the first time.  she gave me, hand's down, the best cut i've had there or anywhere.  she's great with color too."
"i came in here for a cheap haircut a while ago. i have very fine hair, so i think it'd be easy to cut. there's also not a lot of it. anyway, i got home and looked in the mirror and it was not the same length on either side of my face. also, i got a lecture about having to use really expensive salon products if i want to have long hair. the information was presented to me in a ""duh, you're an idiot"" tone. sorry, but if i'm at supercuts, i'm obviously not going to drop a hundo on hair product."
"i don't know what happened right before i walked into this place but yikes!!  i had just moved to chicago and it was so so hot!!  and i need to get my long hair chopped down.  so i go someplace familiar and figure that it will be an easy enough process.  well when i walked in i could feel a weird vibe in the air.  a girl sits me down, is rough with washing and keeps getting water in my eyes.  and as she hacking at my hair and barely talking whatsoever, she is glaring at two other girls that work there everytime they walk by.  evil, dart-like stares thru the mirror.  so i am uncomfortable and leave and tell her i don't need a hair drying and it was hot out so who cares?!  right?  wrong.  i should have so i didn't have to pay for that haircut.  my ""long layers"" i asked for as i always do dried and ended up looking like a bad mullet-like hairdo.  i was horrifid and job hunting at the time.  so in the end i went to a nice salon and spent an extra $50 there - which yes, may have been an awful fate b/c i met my new stylist who fixed me up and i saw after that...but wow!  i've never had that awful of a haircut and sometimes just waiting for it to grow out is too long to wait!!  stay away from salons with negative vibes!!  someone just slept with someone else's bf or something...yikes!"
"i held on to my supercuts card for the longest time, hoping, just hoping that i can get that thirteenth haircut that would be free, but i can't do it. i just can't do it. too many bad haircuts here. while there are one or 2 competent employees here, most of the time, i get butchered.you know it's bad when you're a guy, and your haircut take more than oh, say 20 minutes? i don't have any fancy head of hair. #3 on the sides, 1/2 inch off the top. an experienced barber can do it in under 10 minutes.is that too much to ask? evidently. i need 1 more haircut till my next one is free, but i can't come back here. i just can't. luckily there's a great clips and a haircuttery on the same block. i advise checking out one of them first before going here."
i get my hair cut every three weeks like clock work.  i get it cut so frequently because i'm a little ocd about keeping it neat and short.  so because i'm a little crazy about it i don't have much loyalty to one particular stylist because i like to keep my options open so i can stay on schedule.  so today i went to try super cuts and was pleasantly surprised with thea.  she did exactly what i explained and my cut came out perfect.  i'll definitely be keeping thea's card in my pocket for next time.
"so disappointed in this place tonight.  this is not my regular hair salon to go to, but i was in a rush to get a hair cut.  i walked in and  the desk clerk, wrote down my name.  i waited for about 25 minutes and in the mean time another customer walks in and the desk clerk took down his name.  shortly after this the  desk clerk walked to the back and did not appear again for about 15 minutes.  so during that time, one of the hair stylist, looked on the desk where all our names were and took the customer who had just walked in.  how fair is that, i have been waiting for about half an hour and someone else goes before me.  also just to make a note, the other hair stylist working seemed to be disgusted that the front desk clerk kept disappearing and he had to go to the back to find her.  this was horrible customer service.  i ended up walking out and will plan on trying to squeeze in time during my busy day tomorrow to go to my regular hair salon."
"i googled a few hair salons near sheridan and belmont but didn't find anything less than $50 other than supercuts. i went in their yesterday and the sweet mexican stylist took me in right away and did everything i asked her to do; also, she gave me ideas on what might look better which was really helpful. i've been growing out my hair for 6 months because my last stylist messed it up, but this lady totally fixed my hair, and whatever she couldn't, she told me what to do. i loveee my new hair and i will definitely be going back! if you're looking for a nice haircut and cheapp ($14) then go to supercuts!"
the reviews from this supercuts were from months ago and apparently they made some changes.  my fiance and i went there last weekend and had haircuts.  i had a guy named jason who was able to look at my hair and know how long it's been since my last one and he did a fine job cutting my hair and making me look good.  the lady who did my fiance's hair did a wonderful job.  the price was right too.  excellent haircuts here by total professionals!
stylist kenny is very talented and skillful professional.  one of the best haircuts i have ever had.  call first to add your name to kenny's wait list and availability.
i don't want to give place 1 star. my son needed a haircut so i decided to go here. they looked at us but didn't say anything. the greeter guy didn't feel like greeting at us. he said hi in his lightest voice. that means i barely heard him. he never even told me to sign in on tablet. just rude. i couldn't see myself giving this place my money. please get your act together supercuts not...
"love this location! i used to go to foster and pulaski but this one is so much better. the interior is tasteful and modern. we always see dee! i take my boys, ranging in ages from 10 to 19, to her and she always does a great job. two of my boys have bouncy curls and wear their hair long and two get fades. they've never been disappointed."
"went in today june 14, 2o18 for a trim and color. my trimming came out good but when i asked for red color the guy shows me a dark violet... so when he finally shows me the actual red color i want from the book, we start to color my hair... wired thing is... i've never been to a place where they only color literally your head and not the rest of your hair?  so in the end my hair didn't turn out the way i wanted and the back of my head is a dark black/brown mix color.... i will be going back to see what this stylist can do to fix my hair but other than that i'm super upset. $80 for some half ass color? wtf is that.update. i went back the next day asking for a refund and the assistant manager was super hesitant telling me i needed to come back around 11am or 12noon because the stylist who did my hair starts his shift @ that time and how she didn't know how to work the small machine to give me my refund back on my card. then she tells me she can't give me any cash because there's no cash in the register... i didn't leave... i stood in my car for 20min. i went back in asking if she could just call the guy then because i want the issue resolved and starts giving me an attitude repeating herself telling me to come back so i bitched her out and told her this is ridiculous! ""your an assistant manager, you should know how to give refunds... they train you for that"" so finally i get the refund , and typed in my card info manually but it's been 2 days and i haven't received anything yet so not only will i continue to file a complaint to the better bureau, but i will also be returning to them about my money!!!!!"
"one word, kenny. go to him. he cut my hair exactly as i wanted which is surprisingly hard to do for other places around the area (not sure why).i use to come here pre fire and had pleasant experiences as well but no one tops kenny."
"i have been coming to this location for over 15 years.  there are only a few old timers if you will. it doesn't mean they are old on the contrary good stylists. they do a good job and if for whatever reason you are unhappy or notice something wrong call them   i believe you have a week or so to bring it their attention right away.  their prices recently went up which was a bit of a surprise, but if you shop at jewel look on back of your receipt for a $3.00 saving. anyway, overall good experience as usual for the kids and my wallet."
i love this place!  great service and they make you feel at home.  i got my haircut from sarah and love it.  all the stylists are very professional.  i highly recommend this place.
"kindly woman but when it comes to the hair ,asian one destroyed my hair and she was acting like she knew what she was doing and at the end i gave her tip and left disappointed. woman hair yes for this salon while men's sucks."
"supercuts in general are ok but one employee at this supercuts is a psychopath, i came in with long hair and sat down. within 4 minutes i had the worst haircut of my life. firstly the barber didn't offer to wet or shampoo my hair he just used clippers and yanked my hair out of my head, he didn't even attempt to make it even. it wasn't even close. he didn't blend the top and bottom half of my hair and the moment he finished my haircut he ran out of the store never to be seen again. in total my haircut was less than 5 minutes long and it was completely uneven, fair warning to anyone going to this store avoid the philippino male barber he's a meth-head psychopath. -eli"
excellent service. the young lady who answers the phone (i believe her name is grace) is a sweetheart to deal with any time i call in to schedule a call ahead and kenny the dude who cuts my my hair does a fantastic job as well! overall a very well run operation!
great cut for a supercuts!!! thank god it wasn't a lopsided mower job:) thanks supercuts!!
"wow, what an amazing experience i had. after going to hair cuttery for many years across the street on peterson (next to potbelly) i decided to come here when hair cuttery had made an appointment with me the same morning and then when i had arrived, refused to take my daughter in as a customer and told us to come back after 4 hrs (even with the appointment). so this supercuts had recently reopened after the fire and i never had tried it out. i came straight here since it was closeby and i asked if they would attend to my daughter since she chopped her hair off that morning. they immediately told me we could come in, and started on my daughter. we had dee as out stylist.i explained to them that my daughter got a hold of scissors and chopped her bangs off completely. my daughter is on the spectrum, so they needed to be extra patient with her and i'm always scared they won't be able to handle her. well they were so warm and nice! dee got her comfortable right away and kept telling her how cute she was which made her smile the entire time! they even gave me many options on what i could do with her hair and how we could hide the scalp that was showing in the front where her bangs used to be. i was a mess, crying going into this place after what hair cuttery put me through that morning, and we walked out of here with smiles and a good feeling inside. we found our permanent place for the kids haircuts. love them!"
"so blessed to have found this gem so close to home!  my daughter has super curly hair and wanted a trendy haircut to start senior year. we decided to take our chances with this new shop- and so glad we did! the outside is very deceptive- the inside is gorgeous!  urban loft feel, very spacious and clean. we walked in at 4 on a friday with no wait. now here's the best part- kenny!! it can be so hit or miss finding someone knowledgeable about cutting super curly hair, but kenny was amazing!! his technique was something we've never seen before and he gave my daughter the most awesome cut!! she's thrilled and, of course, so am i. i highly recommend kenny- we will be going back!!"
"i have to say that sarah is the best stylist i have ever had. i started coming to her about 7 years ago. two years ago we moved out of the city to glenview and my husband asked 'isn't there a supercuts closer to here?"" i still come back to sarah every time. she's the best! donna f from glenview."
"this is a great place. good looking loft environment, good music. sarah was welcoming, attentive and professional. she did a good haircut. will come back!"
i got a fantastic haircut from kim. i came in around 5 on a weekday and happened to have no one in line so the wait was short. kim took a bad haircut i was trying to grow out and she made it look great!  she was very friendly and we talked through the whole haircut. definitely recommend her.
"don't bring your kids here. i brought my school aged kids to this location since the foster and pulaski location is no more. the stylist nicked my son's ear with the clippers. she didn't even alert me when it happened, it was only until i noticed through blood she apologized. i was distracted from the minor incident that i didn't notice until i got home how awful his cut was. the only reason i gave this two stars is because the other male stylist did a decent cut on my other son. overall, unhappy and dissatisfied."
"this started out to be a one star review because when i went in for a haircut on 12/19/2016, i received a terrible haircut from a stylist whose name i believe is amanda. when i got home i realized the cut was uneven on both sides and the hair was actually sticking up on one side! i went back that evening and fortunately the young man (sorry, i didn't get his name) was able to take me and make everything right!  i've been a regular customer for many years and i love gloria and sara so thanks to this young man, i'll be back again. i don't usually complain, but i think the matter of the other stylist needs to be addressed."
"for somebody like me, a quick haircut here works just fine. i have thin, lank hair. even dippity do could not tame it. i am middle-aged, and not worried about looking hot or even ""cool"" to attract a mate. i want quick, easy, and neat. i got exactly that today. a hispanic lady chopped off two inches of hair, all one length. i'm happy with my haircut.but your hair is thick, curly, or you want some fancy cut, this may not be the place for you. if you're like me and you want to be in and out fast, and don't have complex demands, this is a good place."
my husband took my son in today to get a simple haircut. #5 on the sides and scissors on top. not that hard. he came home and after his bath i could see how completely butchered and uneven his hair turned out. this is totally unacceptable. pictures have been posted to the business yelp page.
"alba did a great job! love the color. my hair has lots of different colors (reds, blondes, and browns) and she was able to find a highlight color that works well with my skin tone and still have low lights showing. plus she put in this awesome shine spray that makes my hair feel silky and smooth. perfect look for summer. definately will be coming back soon!"
i've been here for my 2 most recent hair cuts and i could not be more satisfied.  i usually pop in on a weekday evening on my walk home. these are some of the nicest people who are genuine and full of character. the cuts are fantastic & reasonably priced. i do however think the salon itself could use a makeover
"please think twice before working there. the wages are very low and they fire you because a close friend is looking for a receptionist job, this is nepotism and prejudices. selfish patty is close minded and gets angry very easily. that tells you how they run their business when a manager, patty,  is behaves angrily over every little minor details. some customers are not satisfied when they leave their shop."
"alexis is lovely and so very sweet. i went in for the first time this afternoon for a root re-touch and also ended having my brows waxed. i've been to the high-end salons and paid double for the same services but i have to say, this experience seemed more enjoyable. yes, the place is a bit bleak with a very chain-like feel (because, duh, it's a chain) but alexis was so personable, chatty (but not in the fake/put-on sense) and did a really good job. plus, you can't get over the price. while i waited for the dye to set, alexis took another haircut appt. -she was so genuine and personable. the client left happy with his cut. seriously, people who write bad reviews about this place are the same people who complain that subway screwed up their sandwich order. they completely overlook that there's a real person who is trying to do exactly what the client asks for."
"i went in late saturday morning.  only had to wait about 10-15 minutes.  blanca cut my hair.  she listened to hear exactly what i said i wanted and proceeded to cut my hair to meet my request.  she is polite, profession, fast & efficient.  i will go back."
"this is my fault. i just needed a trim, an inch or 2 of my all-one-length long hair. sorry, but i just don't want or need to spend $60-$80 in a real salon for a maintenance trim- plus, i was driving by, and thought i would just try and knock this off the to-do list quick and get on with my day.i should have taken the hint when i saw the older lady in a wheelchair (customer) blow drying her own hair at one station, and another stylist walk past her and snarl behind her back in confusion and disgust. that same stylist then skipped me on the list and took a gentleman who had walked in 15 minutes after me. i had been next in line, and confronted her about this, but she inexplicably decided that i was not next. well- i took this as a sign, grabbed my coat and got the hell out of there. screw. that. add to this- outdated 80's décor, employees who are visibly irritated, and just a general air of.... sadness, and i think i got very lucky to be skipped. never again."
"i will start by saying the store in clean and well-lit. as for the quality of the haircut, i don't expect gold coast quality from the supercuts chain but they have certainly managed to lower the bar at this location. the last two haircuts i got there were from different stylists and were easily the worst haircuts i've gotten since i left the army. when a stylist asks 'how does that look?' and needs to be told that individual hairs shouldn't be standing straight up, there's a problem. and when the stylist cycles back and forth from the left side to the right working on my sideburns i just knew my sideburns had risen to new heights. but if you like your sideburns to start somewhere north of the top of your ears then this is the place for you. the next time i need a haircut and find myself near this location i will keep on walking. and the one star is actually a gift because there is no provision for a 1/2 star."
gotten my haircut here multiple times. i already have bangs and just need a trim. shouldn't be too difficult especially if they're already there right? i always get half done jobs aka half my bangs are trimmed other half are not even though i tip 100% and i get pushed out the door with wet hair. not a fan.
"i love this place. simple haircut, simple price. but... i'm so mad right now that i got leslie to cut my hair. kinda heavy set dark skinned lady if you don't recognize her name. but i had a haircut with her one time, wasn't very satisfied. she cut off a bit to much than i asked. i came in again, got her, and thought i would give her a second chance. horrible idea. this time it wasn't the haircut more than it was the service. i had to ask her to cut my sideburns as she was taking off the hair cover. she never asked me! aren't those standard?! and at the end, she never cleaned me up. i had hair all over my face, pinched a bunch of hair resting behind my ears, didn't get a blow dry after and left with wet hair. sorry, this is harsh, but i don't ever want leslie to touch me again. i'll come back for someone else.ps - came home, one side was uneven. yeah. damn."
its the most bad salon i have seen ever because i ask her to cut my hair like the pic i show to her but she decided to make a other hair style and ut was so ugly  hair style i got in my life  unfortunately you have bad team  and now there is no body can fix my hair coz now it's too short
"good luck getting a solid haircut here. if the people who worked at a place like this we're really skilled at what they do, they wouldn't be working at a place like this and there lies the problem."
"as an asian with super straight black hair, it is very hard to find a person of any ethnicity that can cut your hair well. i have been to a few 35 dollar places that can't figure out asian hair. amy at this supercut is the only one that can do it well. she gets the asian hair and all hair. you can tell when they cut with confidence--quickly yet it turns out great. when i use to have the short styled forward and up hair, she did a great job of cutting it for years but it's a simple cut and a lot of people can do it well. now that i have switched to the longer mad men style haircut, it was surprisingly difficult to find a place that can cut it well. i went to gabby's in lakeview (an old school barbershop) but they just gave me a confused look. i guess they're not used to cutting non-white hair. i went to a ""professional"" place--one of those robert jeffery place and the same thing. ""i didn't know asian hair can do that"", was what my guy said. alas, i return to amy (it's hard to catch her sometimes. call ahead..) and she knew exactly what to do. she is too good for supercuts but i'm not complaining.."
"five stars for the haircuts and prices, zero stars for their call-ahead arrangement. supposedly you are supposed to be able to call in up to an hour ahead and put your name on the list. i called and was told to be there in 35 minutes. i walked in 25 minutes later, my name was crossed off the list, and there were five people ahead of me...pretty much makes the call-ahead idea pointless! part of the problem is this particular location is often staffed with just two stylists. but if time isn't an issue and you want a cut for under $15, this is the place to go."
"my go to place for a budget haircut. when you have long, straight hair and don't need more than a trim, why pay more than $13? at this price, you've got plenty of money left over to splurge on a pair of $20 shoes at payless and some vitamin b at the vitamin store next door."
"slow service and unfriendly stylists. much better in the area. cheap price but you get what you pay for, a lousy haircut and poor service"
"i've been going here for awhile now and have made some realizations. 1. while blanca is the sweetest little latina, she butchers my hair every time. 2. amy rocks, and 3. thomas (septum piercing guy who is new to this location i believe) also rocks and has quickly caught up to tie amy as my favorite stylist!"
"i have been going to this location since it opened.  i don't know the precise year, but i'm guessing about 15 years.i went last week and got a new stylist.  she was nice, but she didn't do as i asked in shaping the back of my hair.  so, all week, no matter what i did, pieces of it just stuck out at all angles.this happened once before, ages ago.  i went in and the next stylist fixed it.  i went in today and explained the problem.  they would not fix it unless i paid again.  ok, i'll spring for it.  the stylist completely ignored me and took off more than 1 inch.  i couldn't see the real damage as i am blind without my glasses.  i have a growth behind one ear that usually is concealed and is now totally noticeable.i was furious - and yes, he rang me up.  i asked at least twice, ""why didn't you do wha i asked you to do?""  he ignored me and just said that if i wasn't satisfied, i could go to a high end salon and pay $100.after fifteen years of business, that is it.  i'm outta here."
"i've been coming here for haircuts for many years. i have very easy hair to cut and i get a great haircut from all the stylists. for me, it's a great value."
"i happened to be walking by this location and in need of a haircut. i decided to walk in on a whim and sairz, the manager, greeted me with a great smile and took me right away. she did such a great job with the cut that i came back four weeks later for color and another cut. today, it was very busy but sairz and her staff never missed a beat. they were eternally pleasant and everyone seemed happy with their service. definitely should check it out!"
"i got a haircut today and it was horrible. i told the lady i want a low taper fade on the sides and keep the top (i used to have long hair), but the lady just shaved my hair into a super short cut. i could tell that lady wasn't professionally trained. (she also said i have slim eyes, because i'm asian)"
"thursday 6pm, was on my way to dinner with friends. decided that my hair was too flat and needed a blow dry. i frantically searched for salons that were open during that time around the area - loop. all near me were closed/closing, except supercuts... i've never been to one of these places and to be honest was scared to start now. i decided i wanted a quick trim, and i wanted a 'lob' (long bob), but i knew they wouldn't know what that is, so i crossed my fingers and walked in.*$ide-note on pricing: their prices were competitive to salon prices: $50+ for blow dry, $17 for haircut, and $5 to be washed. the only deal i see is if you get the haircut alone, but dry cuts are not what i'm used to. a nearing high end salon, has varying prices for haircut depending on level, but let's say junior stylist is $60 for haircut, that comes with a scalp massage, and blow dry/style, so it's actually more cost effective, just an fyi.i digress. the woman who cut my hair, elder african american lady, was very kind and stuck to the photo i showed her. i loved my hair and will come back if i'm ever stuck in a time crunch again."
worst haircut ever had... the old lady is more like mowing a lawn rather than cutting my hair. attitude and service are also terrible. don't come.
"this supercuts has been great for me every time. ask for sairz, my favorite stylist!"
"called in the morning about making an appointment for the evening and was told they don't take appointments. kinda odd but okay. i asked if i could come in at 5:30 and was told that was too late since they close at 6:00. i asked if i could come at 5:00 and was again told that was too late. i asked when i should come in and the woman told me to come back at 4:30. i arrive at about 4:32 and was told by the person at the desk that it was way too late for a blow out and that there were 4 people in front of me. i only saw two people in the salon and they supposedly don't take appointments. also, i wasn't asking for an updo or anything fancy it shouldn't take more than a half hour to blow my hair out straight. very irritating seeing as now it is too late to make an appointment anywhere else."
"i have gone to andrew twice last year to get my haircut and he always does an amazing job! granted i don't get anything crazy, just a trim and a few layers, but he does not disappoint! go with andrew and i guarantee you'll get the same quality haircut than those upscale salons that want to charge $75 for a haircut."
"my best friend sent me here and recommended i see venita. i went last saturday for color and a cut. i can now say i have my stylist in chicago!  venita listens. would give her more stars if they were available. i have a television shoot in dallas next week, so i'm going back this saturday for a blow dry & flat iron style. thank you soooooo much venita. you're the best!"
"great deal for shampoo and blow dry!  very flexible with time availability, the hairstylist are friendly and have always done a great job blow drying and straightening my hair.  great savings!"
"nice and friendly service. always clean and we'll kept which can be a nice break from some of the other spots in the city. they have six stations available and every time we've been in they have had 2-3 stylists working. never had to wait more than just a few minutes for the hubs to get a haircut. very short walk from the van buren metra station. exit on the michigan avenue side of the street. usually in and out within about 20 minutes. the hubs is relatively new to the city so supercuts is a brand that he is familiar and comfortable with so he prefers to trek up here from hyde park. when we're back in san diego we will typically patronize local spots but also hit up supercuts periodically. like most chains, it's a very consistent experience and a very consistent price."
"when i go there next month, i'm looking forward to a barber whose scissors are sharp so that the hair is cut and not yanked, someone who can use the clippers to make the sides match without gouges too close to the scalp, and someone who can square off the sideburns so that they match on each side.  you know, like an experienced barber does."
i work around here so i always go to supercuts. my stylist is this amazing girl. i believe her name is vinita.she is awessommeeeeeeeee.
"pros:great location: in the loop, next to office buildings, right on michigan avecons:1. really poor customer service. rude and disrespectful staff2. long wait times. they only have two people staffed at a time so it takes 30-40 mins before it is your turn3. poor system for management of queue. don't seem to respect online appointments. very ad-hoc4. staffers take long breaks before moving to their next appointment.advisable to go to other locations nearby"
"i can't decide whether or not i'll be returning.pros: i paid $15.95 + a $5 tip. i was helped right away by a really nice girl (my receipt said he name was kate or kat...literally that's what the receipt said).cons: i was in and out in about 20 minutes...which is good, but in past salons i've spent about 45 minutes. i didn't opt for the shampoo, but it still seems like it should have taken slightly longer. and it should have, because i didn't really get the layers that i wanted, but my bangs turned out nicely, and that was my biggest reason for running in for a trim."
we generally show up between 3 and 4 p.m. weekdays so there is never a very long wait to get a haircut.  everyone that works there is professional and provides a decent haircut.  no complaints.
"i've been here before, i am a woman with long hair, all one length, and i just needed a trim. a trim. i asked the guy stylist for 2 inches off. he ended up taking more like 4 or 5 inches. i'm kind of pissed. he kept checking in with me, but frankly, i couldn't tell he was lopping that much off at the time. it wasn't until i stood up did i realize how much was gone- and then what was i going to do about it? ugh. ladies- stand your ground and be vigilant."
"i didn't get my hair done. here's why: i came in looking for a wash and blow-dry. i was expecting to pay around $30-$50 which is what i've paid in the past at other salons. i actually thought it might be cheaper because, let's be serious, this is supercuts, the walmart of hair. the price they first quoted me was $50, but then the stylist looked over and said: ""well, her hair is past her bra so it would actually be $75""seventy five dollars to blow dry my hair? no thanks. i walked around the corner and had it done at a fabulous place (fuga) for $45, and even got an excellent coffee with it."
"i went to this establishment for the first time to get a simple bob haircut and came out damn near bald. the ""stylists"" who cut my hair had terrible customer service, he acted like he didn't want to speak which was a second red flag. the fact that the receptionist's hair wasn't combed was the first, however she did speak. i've been getting haircuts at supercuts for years and have always come out happy, until i went here. i rate this place a c ---for close and b for bad customer service.  if you need a cut, run pass this place. #sucks"
"my hair is easy: i keep it buzz short (#1 - #2, depending on the season). you don't really ""cut"" my hair; it's more like a ""mow"" with the clippers.i've always gotten a good, but nothing-to-write-home-about mow at supercuts. not really a supercut, but a sosocut. i haven't been a regular; i just pop in if i'm in a hurry and i'm not popping in to a mom & pop (or usually, just pop) barber.i hadn't been here in a while, but i needed a quickie today, and vanita was perfect for the job! she cut with precision, and was quick to boot. she has a great attitude, a heart-warming smile, and is sweet (but not sugary) like dark chocolate.i've never requested a stylist (or mower) at supercuts, but i'm putting vanita in my little black book (ok, black samsung gs3) right now."
i love it here! it's so close to everything in the city and very convenient for n my way home from work. my favorite stylist is vani. she's very sweet and always has great conversations with you. makes you feel welcomed and good time spent. getting a haircut in other places i feel can be overpriced and sometimes not good. they now have an app for supercuts which is very easy to make appointments. i use it every time.
"very clean and nice and welcoming service. i got my haircut just what i wanted, so i shouldn't complain. men's haircut is decent here. within $15 you might get a good haircut deal including the tip. they use quality products too.$2 off when you are a vet or student, show them your ids. $1 off when you check in from there android/ios app$2 off when you check in on yelp"
never ever coming back rude. unskilled and bad service. i will be letting everyone know to stay away from that place.
"my dother and me  had haircuts month ago , was very good,clean, friendly, good service .we not go no where else. best value for the money."
this location is always running behind. plan to wait 30-40 minutes from your appointment time before you see a stylist.  this is a reoccurring issue they have.  one of the stylist is very obnoxiously well.
"came to get a hair cut, told her the basics simplest haircut, she totally ruined my hair, make me like mushroomed head. totally disappointed and angry! highly not recommend. bad bad bad hair stylest nora. overpriced with rookie hair stylest over all."
great place to get a hair cut. you can ask for the style you want and the people are super nice and very helpful. darsjan
"i came here before and it was fine, today i went back and i don't think i will go there again. i asked for an long a line bob with long layers and showed multiple photos, thought i was very clear on this, got the hair cut, it was not what i asked for, asked for an a line bob again, patricia (the stylist) proceed to tell me how she had cut the hair into an a line, i was confused because the hair was not a line, she then tried to cut the hair again but was frustrated and finally said for another stylist to cut the hair because she wanted me to get what i wanted. at this point the hair wasn't savable although patricia tried to tell me it was. the other stylist cut my hair, again too late to save the hair now. i paid my $14 and left. 1 hour and 30 minutes and $14 dollars lost (i think they gave me a $2 discount for ruining my hair). very disappointing and embarrassed to walk around. haircut is not what i wanted at all but noway to put hair back on. both stylist were trying to be nice. patricia seems like a new stylists and wasn't sure what she was doing and consistently asked the other stylist for help.update:gerald, the owner, messaged and called me to try and make things right. i appreciate his excellent customer service however my hair is already to short to be cut anymore. he offered styling and product consulting if i was willing to go by, but unfortunately i will be out of town (hence why i got my hair cut in the first place)."
"came in not expecting much, figured it was just another chain haircut place. was pleasantly surprised with the service, results, and experience! online check in is super easy and gets you a $1 discount. my stylist ashlee was incredibly kind and went out of her way to make sure i got exactly what i wanted! she engaged me in conversation and made me really feel welcomed. would recommend to anyone in the west side looking for an affordable, quality haircut. will certainly be coming back!"
"over charged my 89 year old mother, wash blow dry $49.00. that ridiculous. jennifer press you should be ashamed...... then told my mom 'you were not charged the correct price in the past. so how was my mom to know your establishment was charging her the wrong price in the past.if you about customer service you would have just let her know and charged her what she paid in the past, and then going forward she would have the option to make the decision on her own.clearly you are about money, not customer service."
"this is an update to my previous review: these guys went out of their way to make things right: they fixed my haircut and i am very happy with the results.i was very impressed that the owner himself contacted me after my first yelp review, taking it upon himself to make sure things were made right.(it appears that this location has recently changed hands and is under new ownership, so older reviews may be outdated.)i'm giving these guys 5 stars for excellent customer service."
"went here for a longer mens haircut. the barber messed up and cut a giant chunk out of by bangs, then apologized and kept just trimming it as if i was going to walk around with a giant chunk missing out of my bangs. i ended up with a 1in haircut. do not go here."
"i got my haircut today, again thinking the location was convenient and the price was right. let me tell you, i had a terrible experience. my hairdresser spoke very little english. she heard them mention ""the c word"" on the radio, and proceeded to ask me what that meant. i played dumb and said that i wasn't sure. then she asked me if it was the word cunt, and she wanted to know the word meant. not what i was expected on my thursday morning.oh, and about the haircut. i am at work so i haven't had too much time to gaze in the mirror, but i'm not a fan. the main thing i notice is that she took a very large amount of hair off around my ears exposing far too much scalp."
this place was pretty clean. i would go back cheap and friendly3 stars is all it is getting from megood luck
"i usually will try not to give bad review and i always will try to give people benefit of the doubt. i had my hair cut done at this suppercuts location and the experience i here is very bad. the store supposed to be open at 9am and when i went there at 9:15am the door is still lock and i have to wait for someone to come open the door.   when i came for hair cut i show the hairdresser the picture on what i want my hair cut to look like and how short i want it to cut. needless to say my hair got butchered.  i afraid to tell the hairdresser that my hair on my side is uneven and unbalance, because when i told her the 1st time she cut my hair shorter and it still uneven. the end result of the hair cut is nothing like the hair cut in the picture. i understand for 16 dollar hair cut it is cheap so i won't have good quality haircut, but the staff seem unprofessional and unfriendly during the whole process. i won't be coming back to this location to have my hair cut and i will advices try other place."
"i wanted this place to work out for me. so close to my place and a very affordable rate. although i was a bit disappointed with the actual haircut.the sign up sheet was actually a post-it note on the counter. there was confusion who actually got their first so it comes down to people being honest, which is fine. to make up a quick excel sheet with name and time arrived would seem to be a simple solution.the stylist who cut my hair seemed that she didn't want to be at her job. my haircut is pretty simple, a 1.5 guard on the side and a 3 on top and fade them together. i ended up with a weird line at the top of my head that didn't look natural. she did ask me where i wanted it trimmed up to, but i have never been asked that before, and thought it was a given to make it look natural.i am going to give them another shot. i would call ahead next time as there were three people ahead of me. all said and done it was about a hour and half by the time i walked out the door."
"time to get the hair did. oh who am i kidding, buzzing my furry mop every few months isn't all that difficult, but managing the colics is another issue. i refuse to pay more than $25 for a fade in the city of chicago, so supercuts has its moments of clarity. they generally trim me up nice and neat, and every once in awhile it looks pretty darn good. it is unfortunate that store policy doesn't allow the stylists any creative form or flexibility with their cuts, so the standard trim is about all you should expect.i have never had a problem with the waiting list. just keep in mind that people sign in and come back later, so just because you thought you were their first, does not mean it happened that way. use a little forethought and planning as well. dont show up at peak hours on friday, sat, sun, or after 5pm on most weekdays if you dont expect to wait for 15 minutes. try an off hour like 2:30pm or early morning on a weekend for your best bet with the lines. even on the worst days, ive never sat more than 30 minutes here. i definitely agree with rusty s., come here if youre in the area, have a coupon, and aware of the possible wait. it is very true they do not seem to have a concept on staffing, however, the profit margin may not accommodate it either. ill be back until i find something easier or cheaper."
"karen was great, haircut was fast and she did a great job. no excessive talking but not weirdly quiet. in and out fast, took care of everything and was very friendly. price can't be beat. will definitely go back."
"i went here because the location was convenient.  i am not someone who is super particular about every detail.  still, this was the worst haircut i have ever had.  absolutely no attention to natural curls and waves.  it is actually more like a man's haircut than a woman's.  and it's a bad man's haircut.  everywhere there is a curl or a wave, there are ends sticking out.  she tried to defeat the big wave in front that i said could not be defeated.  i certainly will not go here again, or even anywhere near a supercuts."
"we decided to take john in for a haircut today, overall okay man haircut."
"was told that there would be a 30 minute wait, there was 2 people ahead of me. a man who came after me also was told that there was a wait and he decided to wait also. at the moment when my turn came mona the stylist walked over to the computer and told the man after me that she was sorry that she didn't realize that he emailed to schedule his appointment, (that funny why didn't he mention that either?) they guy looked surprised (i take it he did not schedule) she just realized that she would get a bigger tip from him. horrible customer service! will never go here again. mona is money hungry!"
"well this is hard for me to do due to my own selfishness and greed, but i believe in karma and the power of yelp so here goes:  ana is just great! i recently started visiting this location as ana transferred over from another location.  as it turns out, she is actually closer to me, which says a lot as i dislike commuting but i was willing to travel a bit to have her cut my hair. ana is first and foremost a consummate professional.  she's great at her job, at communicating, at giving suggestions, about remembering her customers and their nuances, and in addition to that she's just a kind and caring person.  i highly recommend this supercuts location and specifically, ana.  extra bonus:  she will even help you learn spanish while cutting ‍ your hair."
"i often come here to get a quick haircut during my lunch hour.  was very pleased with my stylist maria,  not only was she very quick, she was quiet and not overly chatty.  lines were perfect and and haircut is still looking good 2 weeks later.  excellent work!"
"after the original review, jennifer r. the district ""leader"" contacted me to offer my money back.  i accepted.  it has now been five weeks, and i have not received a check.  i have followed up with her via email, and she has not even bothered to reply.not only can i not trust ""super""cuts to do an ok job on a haircut, i can also not trust them on customer service.  you should second guess yourself if you are going to trust them and may want to search for other places that cut hair.  there are more than a few others in downtown chicago.maybe there is a regional ""leader"" who will still make this right?if i could take away the one remaining star, i would."
calling ahead of booking online means nothing and they never have enough people working.  find some place else
"customer service promised that the district leader will reach out to me. it never happened. they made me call and submit a ticket. terrible service, terrible customer care!one week ago ----------------------------------------------------------------their messagehi,thank you for sharing your experience at our supercuts salon in chicago.  i am sorry it wasn't a better one. you mentioned that you were unhappy with your haircut.we take all feedback very seriously and would like the opportunity to make this right. if you are interested in discussing this with a district leader, please feel free to reach out to our guest services team at 1-888-456-2887 or at the following address: departmentcs@regiscorp.c....  to connect with the supervisor of the salon please visit:"
"probably the worst haircut i've ever gotten. as i looked in the mirror at the end of my haircut i noticed the stylist had cut a chunk of hair off the side of my head in the middle. to make matters worse, chrissy, my stylist, claimed that she didn't do it! i understand mistakes happen, but i can't believe this stylist didn't admit what she did or offer to fix it. luckily the manager, sherri, offered me a full refund. i went to another place where they were able to blend it in. i'll still have to wait for it to grow back for it look normal again. i won't be back to this salon."
"upon entering the stylist did not introduce  herself.  she just asked what kind of haircut i wanted.  i showed her several photos of haircuts. which was many layers and face framing layers (i have very long hair).  when she was done, it looked like she just took a bowl and cut around my top layer.  my hair was all one length and now, i have just have two layers; one layer that ends at my ears and the other the goes down my back.  my hair looks horrible and i am in tears.  the towel service they promise was not provided either.  overall, unsatisfactory.  i will never entrust my best feature with a supercut.  it was my fault for thinking i could get a decent haircut for $16.95.  i literally got what i paid for.  #lifelessonsif you wish to look nice and end with a suitable haircut, do not go here.  it is better to go to an asha type salon and get a haircut done correctly.  it is worth paying the money."
"i don't know how much there is to say about supercuts in general, but i was happy with this location. the staff were polite, i got a haircut in about 15 minutes with no wait (reserved online in the morning), and they seem pretty busy and clean.apparently this is the first time i've seen them give me a hot towel to wipe off my face from the haircut though, which is a nice plus.really, does anyone ever have a giant story from getting a haircut if a: you're a man who doesn't know much about hairstyle or b: nothing horrific happened? i'd imagine not."
"reading some of the reviews i was scared to get my haircut here. but i was desperate and out of time so i walked in after work today and got my hair cut by maria. she was quiet (which i prefer) but did a god job and was quick about it. it's not the best haircut i've ever had, but it's certainly not the worst either, especially for the money."
"i was a loyal customer for three years. my stylist, ivonne, is great and deserves a five-star rating on her own.but since this location started trying to high-tech up appointments with their snazzy new app, my last four appointments have been ignored. i call (or now app) ahead, clear that hole in my day and make the trip in, and find myself on the same wait as if i hadn't scheduled at all. three of my last four attempted haircuts resulted in me running out of waiting time and leaving with nothing accomplished.i like ivonne and i wish she could still cut my hair, but time and principle force me to another haircut place that will honor appointments and its customers' time. very disappointing.looking for recommendations for a good, reasonably priced men's haircut option in the loop!"
"started coming here a few months ago. haven't had a bad cut yet. then again my hair is really short, pretty much a high and tight.love the online sign up process. super convenient."
"worst. haircut. ever.   except for the last time i went there 2 years ago.i was clear about what i wanted -- clean up my cut, trim about an inch, longer on top than the sides.  i came in with a side part, and left with a center part.  not my idea.   i don't know what the gal was thinking about, but it wasn't my haircut.  she made it lumpy and lopsided, and i decided to leave rather than see if i could talk here through getting it right.  i don't have enough hair for that.   back to the haircuttery on halsted for me.  they always do a nice job, and it is equally inexpensive.  but like night and day."
"i have been going here for about 3 years as it is convenient to go get a haircut on lunch break while working in the loop.  there is a woman here who has cut my hair probably 25 times over the course of my frequenting this establishment, and every time i end up with her, she does a real great job.  i wish i knew her name.  i think it's wendy.  i should find out.granted, my haircut is easy (well, really, what do i know, i don't cut hair).  but you just take a 1 guard around the sides and back, then fade it up to the top of my head and leave about 1"" of hair up there.  so it sounds pretty easy to me.  anyways, i have always been happy with the haircuts i walk out of here with. i tried to get an $8 hair cut at some latin american type place near my house and walked out with a way crooked fade and a big chunk of hair missing from the back of my cranium.  i of course can not see the back of my own head, and in retrospect the haircutter there curiously did not give me a mirror to inspect her handywork, so when i got home my girlfriend's roommate politely pointed out that the back of my head looked ridiculous.  this has not happened at supercuts in the thompson center and for that i is grateful."
"have you ever been hit on by a guy so sleezy and so below your standards that you felt like you needed to take a shower afterward, just from being spoken to?  yeah, that's what supercuts felt like to me.  if you've read any of my other reviews, you know that i am 100% loyal to my gia at the charles ifergan salon.. the place that brings you lemon waters and treats you like a queen each time you go.  well, during budget craze where for a brief moment i considered haircuts a ""non-essential"" item, i decided that supercuts may be a decent choice for a simple trim.  i mean, cut and tip for less than twenty? i thought this was the answer to my budget woes.  well, my hair has never recovered from the emotional trauma since, and i will never consider haircuts a non-essential budget item again.honestly, ladies, a hair cut isn't just about the cut.  sure, you need someone with great technique and who can make you look beautiful (neither of which supercuts offers), but more than that, going to a salon is also a spiritual experience.  there is nothing like sitting in the chair having your hair cut by someone who looks just as hip and beautiful as you want to feel.  you want to look around and see other people who care enough about their appearance to put in the time to come to a nice salon.  you want to be pampered and made to feel like a goddess in a place with aesthetic furniture, calming music, and the sound of stiletto heels on the ground.going to supercuts was like walking into a grocery store.  not the hip whole foods type of grocery stores with milfs walking around.  it was like going to a grocery store in the middle of the afternoon where you see people walking around aimlessly like they are just trying to distract themselves from the fact that they don't have a job.  it's like walking into some fashion bug type store off a recommendation from a co-worker only to discover that it's a store where fashion comes to die and you know you have to escape before someone you know spots you.  i feel dirty just writing this review b/c i feel dirty for having ever walked into the store.  there is no amount of frederick fekkai products i can buy to make up for what i did, and just the mere thought of having ever walked into this salon makes my skin crawl.  what the hell was i thinking?and if hating supercuts makes me a snob, then a snob i will be.  but unless you've done it yourself, don't judge.  it was truly that awful."
"nothing special. i went in with my friend to get hair cuts and we both exchanged glances as we realized all of the customers were males (not something we're used to at salons.) we both work near by and needed inexpensive haircuts asap. i noticed all the women working also looked the exactly same (must be family owned franchise or something..) after waiting about 30 minutes i got a cut, basically a trim because i was too scared to complicate/confuse the dresser (the cuts they were giving all the men didn't look too good). i left with just a few inches off, i basically look the same. my friend also had the same feeling, they didn't really do much. so for about $20 including tip, it was okay. i wouldn't ask for anything too picky, they don't seem very experienced. though, i don't think i'll go back."
my cut and highlights are perfect at 1/2 price other placescut depends on who you get  but sheri and gina are the best!this place is closed weekends
"i'm going to engage in a bit of wacky, so-called reverse stereotyping and say that this is what happens when you get your hair cut by a straight guy. i'll admit that i am 50% at fault for my unsatisfactory haircut, as i tend to forget the description of what i'm looking for, but the guy may well have decided to make his own decision regardless. he didn't cut the top short enough, and he explained that he did so because i would look too bald otherwise. uh, thanks for the editorializing, dude.i knew i should've sat back down and made him cut it down, but i felt like i was in some kind of twilight zone, or tractor beam, or insert your preferred dorky sci-fi simile here, and i also felt like this guy had opinions too strong to be overruled by pitiful ""customers,"" so i just gave up hoping that i could get it fixed at the other loop location, where i'd had much better service. this place is closer to my work, but who cares! if someone's gonna cast aspersions on me, they oughta at least give better results."
"how is it possible to have someone else do your hair, yes, for $45 at supercuts - and have it look worse than your own paltry efforts. i don't know how it's possible, but the wierd little chick who washed, blow dried and used the flat iron on my hair managed to do so. for the thompson center, you'd think they'd have a better ""quicky"" salon than this flea bag shop.  i've never paid more than $30 for a cheapy quicky, but i accounted for its being in the thompson center. huh-uh. location has nothing to do with the quality (not) of service (and subsequent lack thereof)  in this place. frankly, i think the place felt creepy...i couldn't wait to get out of that chair, and i swear - i do a much better job - and i can't see the back of my head!"
"i really am sorry to see the horrible reviews on here. i have only seen one person here, yolanda. i was tired of paying for pricey haircuts and being miserable after i leave with an ugly haircut. i figured, if i'm going to walk around with ugly haircuts, i might as well be paying $15 for them. i walked in, as they do not take appointments, and was seen quickly by yolanda. i am a woman and wear my hair short, like a pixie cut. yolanda had me skipping out of there in 20 minutes. my haircut was so cute, and it only cost $15! i went back, same thing. again and again. i have been going to her for at least a year now, and short hair needs a trim every few weeks. once or twice it isn't quite right, but i go back in a few weeks and it's great. i've tried growing the side, growing the bangs, angling the cut, and yolanda keeps up. i'm going back today."
"i agree with one of the other people that reviewed this supercuts location, i wish there were negative ratings. giving one star is too generous. i was told to see yolanda by a friend. well, yolanda did one hell of a hack job on my hair and then thought she could camouflage by blow drying and then flat ironing my hair.  i tried to live with it for a few days. couldn't, so i went back and teecha (sp?) was the next person that i tried. i say person and not stylist because that would not be an accurate description. she tried to clean up yolanda's mess but failed. i went back to her once more thinking all i needed was to let it grow out a bit so there would be more to work with. uhmm yeah, i was wrong. i went to a professional on saturday and when she combed out my hair and showed me how bad it was i wanted to scream! how do you cut off too much hair and then try and cover it by leaving the next layer longer?! never again!"
"i've been going to higher end salons for 40 years to get my  hair cut.  i would go to the same person for several years, then they would quit, or move to a salon further away from where i lived, and i would have to find another person.  i finally bit the bullet and decided to go to a ""supercuts"", which happens to be 5 minutes from my house and which i know was low priced, so i always figured it would be so-so haircuts.  (you know, ""you get what you pay for"").  well, let me tell you, i was pleasantly surprised by my first visit.  yes, i had to wait, but that is the way it is. so i learned to call in advance for an appointment, and hardly ever wait now. but that's not the best part.  what i was so happy with was the lady who cut my hair.  her name is martha.  she not only is one of the friendliest and pleasant people i've dealt with in the hair cutting world, she also can cut hair!  each time i've gone in, (probably about 6 times now over 1 and half years), she has listened to me and given me a great cut.  today was the best yet!  i showed her several pictures of what i wanted, (knowing that you can't always get the cut you want, if you don't have the same hair as the person in the picture!), and she did a fantastic job.  i would recommend supercuts, not only because it is extremely fair priced, but you get a great hair cut too! thanks martha, you  made my day!"
"arg, you get what you pay for. i had a stylist (i think her name was donna?) and she did a horrible job. i wanted a layered cut--same cut i have been getting for years--and she told me it wasn't possible. the end result was an ugly, ragged cut that i had to get corrected elsewhere. not coming back again."
"just wanted a blow dry. hair is crazy frizzy, and i asked her if she could fix it and she blamed it on my hair. i could have done it better myself. very disappointing."
"i used to go here years ago but had bad luck, but i think it changed ownership over a year ago so that's when i decided to give it a try again. my sons and i have been here a few times over the past few months on weekday afternoons and had good experiences. there was not much wait, we got really nice haircuts and the ladies were friendly. plus they'll take the supercuts coupons you have even after the expiration date, making the price quite reasonable.so i don't know why currently there are some negative reviews.  i have no complaints and we'll be back."
"i come to supercuts in the glen because of a fabulously, talented stylist named martha. she is kind, funny and gives me a terrific haircut every time. she is always in a good mood with a great smile. martha is an extraordinary stylist. you cannot beat the haircut for the price. please give her a nice tip because she deserves it! i would follow her anywhere because she's the best!!!"
"i started my experience by check in online at 10am. the website said '25 minutes"" i went in at 10:15 and stated i check in online and the lady said, ""wait and i""ll take you shortly"".shortly after a young man walks in and signed in and she took him right away.  which upset me since i've been waiting and had checked in online earlier... all meanwhile i have to listen to one of the stylist with a eastern european accent rip on our president, talk about how horrible our country is, and bad mouthing our military.....after waiting an additional 20 minutes, i had to leave since i was supposed to get my haircut 30 minutes earlier.... and had to get to an 11:30am meeting nearby it was very disappointing at the service and attitude these employees have towards their customers and our country...."
"my family and i have been getting our  haircut with teresa for over 10 years. although she has moved around quite a bit, we've managed to follow and keep up with her because she is really amazing. teresa is especially good at cutting and layering hair for both men and women. we have never had a bad experience and that's why we always come back. i recently colored my hair for the first time with teresa and she did a beautiful job. if you're going to supercuts, make sure to set up your appointment with teresa. she is absolutely phenomenal, you will not regret it!"
"i really love the work my stylist does and have been going there for years.   there are few changes that i don't care for:  1) they removed the tv years ago, so during cubs/hawks games i went somewhere else as not to miss the games  2) they now don't take appointments unless the stylist is actually there."
"quite possibly the worst haircut ever gotten in the last 10 years. i guess you really do get what you pay for. i walked in the door and the two stylist that we're still there were arguing about something. then got a haircut and the lady just absolutely butchered half my head.  i will never go back here. first time kama just moved into the neighborhood, never again."
teresa cut my hair and does an awesome job! she is so professional and makes sure i come out of the salon satisfied and beautiful! she is awesome at what she does. you should ask for teresa!
great haircut for the price. can't beat it. teresa's been my go to for years. recommend her for a quick and quality haircut. remember to call ahead because they fill up quick at times.
"i went to just have 1"" cut. this was a simple straight cut which is why i went to super cuts. zarina ( name she told me ...by the time i asked for it she knew i was very unhappy with the job she did...) cut 3"" off. she kept insisting in order to make it even she needed to cut this much. i asked to see any of the hair she cut that was at the 1"" i requested but she said it was on the floor and mixed with other people's hair. there was no hair that was 1"". it was an awful experience. if she can't do a simple cut i would be very wary of going to this super cuts."
consistently good haircuts at a very reasonable price! i've been a client of teresa's for more than ten years and have always been happy with my haircut. she's very enthuziastic and provides excellent customer service. i highly recommend supercuts @ patriot bvld. ask for teresa!
"show up at 815p, location is scheduled to close at 9p. no other customers in the store, after sitting for a minute, ""stylist"" comes out from the back and asks if i come back tomorrow. since when do businesses turn paying customers away, 45 minutes prior to closing? my hair cut takes 5 - 10 minutes at most. no, i will not come back and give you my money when it is more convenient for you. i can understand if there were multiple customers in store but there were none and this isn't the first time this has happened. on a positive note, when i have gotten my hair cut here, they've done a fine job. will try out sports clips, great clips, hair cuttery or one of the other options out there..."
"it all depends on who cuts your hair. martha and an asian lady that have cut my hair do an excellent job. this other person who works on sundays butchered my hair twice. she will not be cutting my hair again!in the future, i will only have martha or the asian lady cut my hair."
"checked in online. promised zero wait time. i get there. two people available. and yet i'm made to wait for over 10 minutes. in my view, defeats the purpose of checking in online.  also - one the haircut people always have to get the phones which doubles the time of your haircut. however i'm most miffed about checking in online and then having to wait - especially when there are multiple people available. if they want to take breaks that should be factored into the expected wait time and not made as zero."
"i had my hair cut and colored by christina last weekend.  the color turned out okay but the haircut was awful..... the worst i've ever received.  she totally hacked at my hair.   just be advised.... you get what you pay for!update: 12/2013 - worst.haircut.ever!!!  another hack job. this place is a crapshoot.  just because someone has gone to beauty school doesn't mean they can give a good haircut.  i've been coming here for a few years now and i've been lucky to get a string of good stylists (2), but they eventually leave for better jobs.  then, i have to try my luck with a new stylist.  sigh"
"if i could give negative, i would.  rude, rude, rude is the only word i can think of when it comes to the blonde stylist; cheryl i believe is her name.  not to mention rough.  my 12 year old  told said to me ""mom.  she was mean.  she kept yanking my head around really hard."" why let people put name on list if they go in only to be told another 30-45 minutes??  will never go back even though it is pretty much across street from my house.  would rather drive 20 minutes out of my way to get my son's haircut."
i've been happy with this place for a cheap hair cut that is decent and covers the basics.  i've been to many of the different hair cutters and they all do a good job.
"love this place for the money as long as i never have cheryl !!!!!!!!!!soooo much of her personal phone calls, personal drama, all about cheryl attitude.  she is more interested in getting you in and out of her chair in as little time as possible to rack up the $$$$$.  i suppose supercuts loves that about her but as for the customer.....i come to relax and have my hair done, not hear her drama and see pictures of her latest boyfriend etc etc ad nauseum........she is very unprofessional but cuts fast and alot so management looks the other way - little do they know that word on the street is stay away because of cheryl.  ask for anyone else but cheryl although you will still hear her drama throughout the shop!will management ever wake up to this girl!!!!"
thanks glenda. i went to another loaion before and was not happy. i did try again here. i was not greeted at 1st but the glenda quickly noticed i was a client not just coming to sit in the waiting area. she was woman of few word (fine with me) she clean up my original style and i was on my way in 30 mins tops. pros- not crowdeddidn't push me to by productsconshair was on the floorone employee was clearly socializing.not enough change in the cash register eventhough chase is inthe same strip mall (3 doors over).
"lady asked me about the hair cut that i need , i told her will need to cut it short and make sure all side are equal and if needed to cut little shorter we can. she told me no if you decided to cut more after what i do i will charge you another $16.50 for another hair cut , because that takes time and she don't have time for that .i was like really ? she was so rude .i'll never go there again thanks for the terrible experience"
"i went for a haircut in november, right before thanksgiving.  there was a temp working, and she did a terrible job with my hair (e.g., uneven cuts), which i didn't notice until the next day.  (i was in a hurry and didn't have my glasses on.)  the next day, i went back; the manager fixed the cut free of charge.  i went back again today; i received another uneven cut.  in addition, the person cutting my hair kept mumbling under her breath, as if i were doing her a great disservice by asking for a simple cut.  when she was done, she did not ask whether the cut was ok.  she simply walked to the register and began the check-out process.  i've learned my lesson: you get what you pay for."
"i dropped in while my boyfriend and i were out walking the dog. galena is lovely, and she did a wonderful job with my hair. i will definitely go back!"
"do not go here - i have been the victim of 2 of the worst haircuts of my life. tonight my butchers name was stephanie; a cold-hearted, unemotional, ruthless killer of good hair and style. from the moment she sat me down i could see the callus in her eyes and while i sat there hoping for the best; alas, i got her worst. she mercilessly chopped and snipped her way into the #1 spot of my all time worst haircuts. not only did she leave me with a faux widows peak, as shown in the attached image, but when asked as to how this could have happened she merely replied with malice in her heart ""it'll grow back"". to which i replied, "" i will be back here, nevermore""."
unbelievably bad haircut from this place.  i've ended up with this uneven and inadvertent anti-mullet that i never asked for.  my usual place was closed and i needed a haircut now im contemplating getting a buzz cut to cover up the damage from supercuts.
"i don't get it. every time i go it's a 30+ minute wait. the haircuts are okay. the price are moderate. but i don't have an hour to wait for a hair cut. and when you say there's two people ahead of me, don't bump my spot back. you lost another customer today."
"first of all make your appointment online with the app it will get you in sooner. i have received many skilled, thoughtful cuts from daisy. i get the same style every time and i get compliments so for a decent haircut i recommend supercuts."
samantha did a great and fast job. prices are very cheap and she got the job done well. she was very honest by telling me what she could and couldn't do. worked out fine and i'm happy with the results :)
i have been a customer for 17 years (used to be borics back when). samantha has been my stylist for about the last 5 years.  she has such talent she could work in a trendy upscale salon but she said she likes her customers & is happy here-lucky for me & her other regulars! sam gets busy on weekends but is worth the wait (she never rushes which i appreciate as i wouldn't want someone rushing my cut). i have also had good experience with galina & gladys who have worked here for years.
"awful awful awful!!walk-ins are not welcome!!they say they don't take appointments, walk in and wait over an hour and a half and still people walking in front of you"
"if you come to this supercuts, ask for samantha. she'd the only capable person there. otherwise, be warned - check pics to see what the ""stylist"" did to my 9 year old."
"haircut was actually really good. i gave specific instructions and they followed exactly what i wanted. i asked for an upper lip wax which left me with hair on my lip. the technician went over the entire lip in one strip, rather than two or more. so she did not follow the arch of the lip leaving me with lots of hair that i saw later when i got home. i suppose they aren't exactly known for their waxing services though. but it would be nice to have it done properly."
this place was really okay as borics before it was acquired by supercuts. since it became supercuts it has been staffed by employees that don't have any skills whatsoever. after my visit last week i will never come here again. buyer beware.
"i have seen galina many times - she is very precise and takes her time,in a good way.;  just saw samantha - she is also excellent; i would recommend both of them!"
"received a very bad haircut from an incredibly unprofessional haircutter who lacked any integrity or pride in her work.  didn't ask me how i wore my hair.   i asked for short and professional and received a buzz cut that made me look like a tennis ball.  no style at all.  not even close.  after she had ""finished"" i pointed out several places where she'd missed spots.   the manager then cut my hair for 5 more minutes and apologized.  never offered a refund.  instead offered a coupon for a free haircut next time.  i will not be returning.    my favorite exchange:me:  ""you didn't ask me how i wore my hair.""cutter: ""well, we have a lot of regulars here and we already know how they wear their hair.""me:  ""do you know how ridiculous that response is?""  i've had many great haircuts at places like supercuts, fantastic sams, great clips, etc.  this place just employs a person who doesn't care at all, is in the wrong profession, and has a manager that doesn't oversee the work being produced by her employees.  bottom line:  the haircut was $11.  you get what you pay for with this place."
"save yourself the hassle and do not go here. i made the mistake of running in yesterday for a quick cut and the stylist (hate to even call her that) had no idea what she was doing. when asking how short i wanted, she actually cut it short to show me. um, yea - we're still discussing here. thankfully it was underneath so it doesn't show but who does that? also my hair looks totally unstyled - just a blunt cut because, obviously, she doesn't know how to do any better. my husband could have done a better job! stay away!!! i wish i did."
"as a working professional, i feel like i'm supposed to drop $40-60 on every haircut. but i don't because i really love galena and samantha at this location (the other hairdressers seem friendly and popular, too, but i've never had them cut my hair). both women take their time and understand how to deal with my fine, very straight hair that shows every cut. i'm a big fan! the only downside is the wait on weekends, but that's not surprising."
"sam is excellent! i think she is also the manager at this location.had to wait 30 mins, but it was worth. will definitely go again."
"i normally don't go to supercuts, but i was in desperate need of a haircut and didn't have time to make an appointment elsewhere so i decided to give it a try, i paid about $15, and got one of my favorite haircuts! unfortunately, i don't remember the stylist's name, but i will be coming back."
"the power of yelp.  after my regular hair specialist at a competing chain left unannounced, i decided to check yelp for somewhere near the loop.  i found this location in river north, a little further than i wanted but i didn't mind for the right experience.  well, thanks to yelp, i found out about ana.  she is first and foremost a consummate professional.  she's great at her job, at communicating, at giving suggestions, about remembering her customers and their nuances, and in addition to that she's just a kind and caring person.  full disclaimer, ana has transferred to the loop location at the thompson center, but this location is still very nice and in fact one of her own family members is still here.  i highly recommend this location and highly recommend ana."
come here not expecting much but get the best hair cut ever!!! veronica are the best she fast efficient and make me look real cute thankyou!!!
"i recently cut all my dreadlocks off. i came here because it was close to where i had an appointment. friendly and courteous staff, i signed in and had to wait only 5 minutes. she trimmed my new short do in minutes & cleaned it up nicely. all for just 11 dollars!"
"i called my mother on facetime and first thing she yelled ""who are you??""  she couldn't recognize me with a newly established beard and fluffy disheveled hair.  so i decided it's time to take care of the aesthetic department of my head. in general, if you're not going to a fancy event, would you feel like spending too much money on cutting hair!. so i looked up supercuts because i had a great experience with them in other states. i read the reviews about this location and they were extremely bipolar. either the best experience or a lady who she said they cut her ear. or another who found this place too shady and cheap for her. this location is across the street from the magnificent mike whole foods on huron st in case you got lost. michigan ave was insanely crowded on the black friday. it was such a nice stroll over here. i talked to ana over the phone, she said walk-in is welcome. when seated, rose took excellent care of my head. she was very smooth and experienced. we had a great chat. we talked about taquitos and mole. she gave me an order to try a taqueria she loves. my head looked great and i was happy after rose did her job. then i had a head wash/massage. omg! it felt crazy good!i definitely recommend the head wash and shampooed head massage here. although i gave a generous tip, but i guess this experience was worth more. i read that ana and veronica are awesome here. but i already hired rose."
"i've had one good and one mediocre cut. not a ton of barbers in the area, so this works if you don't want to travel. go in with specific instructions and you'll be just fine."
"so i go to a lot of great clips/super cuts, so my review is based on similar comparisons. this place just isn't as good as the others. my hair dresser wasn't very friendly and didn't really do a great job. i'm not all that thrilled with my cut, but it's not awful (i asked for a trim and the front piece to be angled...nothing fancy!) the prices are hard to beat, but i'll definitely walk the extra few minutes next time to try out the great clips."
"i am writing to compliment andrew, my regular stylist at this location in chicago. he is always very cordial and professional in providing me with excellent customer service, giving me great haircuts and beard/mustache trims according to my specific requests.andrew is an asset to supercuts in general, this location and to all the customers he serves.matt hauman"
"shout out to michelle for a great cut. i was in the city on business and needed a quick cut and style. she did a great job of layering my hair and listened & cut carefully to make sure it was just like i wanted. all the customers coming in and out seemed like regulars, and the staff greeted them by name. happy place with a friendly staff."
i love this place.  i have been a customer of armando for more years than i care to admit.  he never misses a beat & the shop runs flawlessly.  always upbeat & professional -yet fun staff.  definitely recommend this supercuts location.
"i was looking for a new salon so i stopped into supercuts to see what they had to offer.  i was greeted with smiles and people willing to help me, including the owner armando.  i wasn't planning on getting a hair cut that night, but when they said they could get me in right away, i decided to try it.  i believe my hair was cut my nora (but i might be mistaken by her name!).  i was so thrilled with the cut and i've received so many compliments on it already.  it's a few blocks away from my apartment, which is extremely convenient and the price is just right.  living so close to michigan ave and the gold coast, it's nice to be able to get a haircut without having to spend an arm and a leg.  i will be going back!"
"great place to get the style you want in an affordable way, the staff are up to date with the latest and greats trends. i normally have trouble someone who can work with curly hair, i was very happy with my cut and style when i left. highly recommend!"
"terrible, really bad experince, i won't come back even if they will offer me free hair cut for life.i made a mistake that i step into this place, i got hair cut by lilly medina. she is not hair stylist and not even close to. bad bad don't go."
"consistently terrible - these people are garbage at cutting hair and even worse at customer service (and also super shady!). 1st time i was here, the woman cut my ear which was exquisitely painful. the manager came by and declared that i was not bleeding (lie) and then at the end, gave me a bandaid (why would you do that unless i was bleeding???). i thought it was a freak occurrence and came back again for convenience. hair cut ended above the chin (not what i asked for) and they deny doing anything wrong. they never admit to the mistakes they make and will charge you if you ask them to fix it. my hair looks like a mess. i asked for thinning and i ended up with an asymmetrical cut with lots of frays - it looks like a nightmare. avoid at all costs. this is a lesson in giving 2nd chances."
"you might ask , why the hell is this guy giving 5 stars to a hair cut place?well i will tell you why.i have gone here on and off for a few years. sometimes i go to someone name veronica who is very efficient and fast. but what i do is i call and tell them i will be there in half and hour. then when i go in, i get my hair cut done within 5 minutes of me being there.in the maybe 10-15 times i have been here i cant say that i have been here for over 25 minutes. that is very efficient and they care about your time.its not by appointment only but it does not hurt to call before"
"the worst haircut ever. avoid at all costs. have used this place because it is close to mhome. the last cut the worst. they do not speak fluent english. so they cut as they want. never again will i fall for the close and cheap.no one in the area goes here leaves a good review, they depend on tourists, or anyone only needing a nimber 2 shave."
"it has been hard finding a reliable place downtown that gives a good haircut at a reasonable price. i tried this supercuts which is a couple blocks from where i live. it turns out that one of my old stylists, lilliam, is working there and she always gave me a great haircut. i went to her for several months but due to some scheduling conflicts of my own, she was not there one night and i got my hair cut by sandra. she gave me an amazing haircut and probably the best shampoo i have ever had. i mostly see sandra now (because she is there in the evenings) and could not be happier. both sandra and lilliam are terrific stylists and i would recommend either one. thank you sandra and lilliam for the best cuts in chicago!"
"usually i pay 50-60 for a haircut and for a trim, not necessary. i walked in after work about 430, got right in. they trimmed my hair dry, which i've never had done before and was a little nervous about especially because i have curly hair. in and out in 10 minutes and staff were very nice. will be coming back for sure."
"i go to this location as this is closest to me and i only need trim for my hair and not any special style/cut. i usually see hair stylist anna - she is very nice, does the job well and is courteous to clients. the receptionists though whoever is at front desk except the hair stylist herself are all very rude. the older looking stylists who try to act as the manager not sure if the is actually the manager is utter mannerless always carry that attitude on her god knows for what. may be cz i dont see her and always wait for someone else? if you only care for your stylists and getting your job done this is a place but if you are looking for anything like customer service its a big no no. those stars only for stylist and lost starts for management for being consistently terrible at being courteous to clients"
i went to see chrissy after a disastrous color by another salon nearly ruined my hair.  i initially saw her for a haircut and her cut and blow-dry were so fabulous i went back to her the next day for a color re-do and have been going to her ever since. she highlights my very long hair and doesn't seem bothered that i have a lot of it. her color always turns out so natural and my hair is in the best condition it's ever been in. her blow-dry and style is incredible. the best i've ever had.
"i started here after my italian barber left the country without informing me. supercuts was almost across the street so i decided to try it. my first appointment was with ana and i lucked out. she does a great job and has been cutting my hair ever since. the price is about half of what i'd been paying before for the same quality. i use the app for appointments and occasionally have to wait because ana is so popular, but it's never long and worth it."
updated review: the front desk girl just called me back and yolanda now has an appointment and is able to fit me in. i'm a returning customer after all!yes yolanda is amazing but too bad the girls who schedule can't seem to remember when she works! i called yesterday at 10:30 to schedule an appointment and the girl told me to call back at 11:00. when i did the next girl said she wasn't working that day. she told me to call back the next day at 11:00. when i did that the girl said that she had come in at 10:00 and was now completely booked with no availability.i cannot wait any longer to cut my hair and will be going to another salon from now on.
"terri did a fantastic job on my sons hair. he has course, heavy, thick hair and curly to boot! she did exactly what i wanted, no hassle. we were going to the boardroom and weren't quite happy. word of mouth brought me here."
be sure to get a name if you call ahead and make an appointment bc chances are someone will screw up and even though you made a reservation 30 mins prior ( as instructed) you will come and be put at the back of the line.   not even sure getting a name will really help though?!?  maybe it's a bad place for a girls haircut?  seems like everyone can do men but maybe only some can do women and that's why they just put another guy in front of me? $54 for shampoo ($9) cut ($19) blow ($25). hmmm
"horrible experience here! i decided to come here because it was very affordable ($16.95 for a haircut), and i just needed a trim. boy was that a mistake...i did the check in on the website to get a spot in line before you arrive. it worked great, and i only had to wait about 5 minutes once i arrived. the lady cutting my hair was quite rude from the beginning. she told me i need to wear leave in conditioner all the time and was annoyed i didn't have it in my hair. i said i didn't need a hair wash which she seemed bothered by as well. she took a total of 5 minutes to cut my hair. 5 minutes!!! she said the left side was already shorter than the right side so it didn't need to be cut. the whole point of getting my haircut was to get rid of the split ends everywhere, so i didn't understand her point. also my last haircut was at an upscale salon in nashville so i know for a fact both sides are equal. i left very unsatisfied with the haircut and will have to go elsewhere to have it fixed."
terrible haircut. the person cutting my hair had no idea what she was doing and went to get help from another employee only after she butchered my hair.
great service! always do a quick job and do it very well. i've never been able to make appointments so i don't understand the bad reviews concerning a non existent appointment system. sounds like over privileged complaining to me.
"this has been bugging me for a long time but today was the last straw. supercuts doesn't honor appointments! today i called ahead and put my name on the list for a set time that they agreed to, then i showed up and they said that i'd be behind all 8 people in the waiting room. i clarified that she was viewing me as a scheduled haircut at this certain time, and she confirmed, so i walked out. she was not understanding but frankly she's probably confused about her store's policy to accept scheduled appointments and then put these people behind walk-ins. it's gotten to be so frustrating, just please tell me that this time won't work if you can't get me in within 10 minutes of my scheduled time, i'd rather choose a later time then show up and wait!!!"
"yolanda does an incredible job. i'm here temporarily and received a hair cut from her about a month ago, when i came in conversation picked up like it never dropped off. she remembered who i was and what i was doing in dallas. it's customer service like that, that is unique. not to mention she does an incredible job"
"i have had 3 hair cuts here so far. i'm leaving 2 stars for the first 2 hair cuts. (looking back after writting this, my hair cut just now was god awful, i can't bring myself to leave 2 stars)i just got the absolutely worst experience i've ever had getting my hair cut. i was in and out in like 15 minutes she took a #2 or #3 to the sides and back after i asked for a #4. it's way to short and instead of blending it looks like she took a bowl and a razor to the back of my head! no gradual blend nothing just a strait line then your into hair, i could have done the back of my own head better with a piece of glass and a mirror! this was terrible and no one would look me in the eye on my way out. she didn't ask how i wanted the back and just jumped in with the ""#4"" and cut a strait fucking line. and it was too late  she knew she screwed up and i wouldn't dare let that but her try to fix it. she didn't even get the top back where i had specifically asked for it! i didn't want that butcher touching me anymore after she screwed up the back and sides that bad then says ""done!"" yup i'm done! if i had her do what i had wanted i bet i would have ended up with a shaved line through my head and her looking dumber then usual while trying to explain how that was on purpose. my hair has been thinner since my cancer treatments and it really shows when its butchered like this. inconsistent, terrible job, i through down my money and kept more change then i ever have from a hair cut and ran out of there! i have never left a hair cut feeling this low. if you get your hair cut here ask for the german lady, she is kind and polite and cuts hair like she cares what you look like. she deserves 5 stars. she did my last cut here and i loved it. my hair looked good and thicker after! so i came back but they gave me to a cutter today instead of a hair dresser and now i'm writing a review considering wearing a hat in 100degree texas summer..."
"i understand this is a drop in kind of place and if you do that, it probably gets the job done. but i've been getting my color done there done there for about 6 months because it's the only place open on sunday's. it is always a comedy of errors. you have to call ahead and every time it takes a minimum of 5-8 minutes while everyone that works there shouts back and forth about it. for some reason they have to ask every stylist of they ""have time to do a color today"".   i know because they have no idea how to use the hold function. on the few times they do use hold, the person always picks up like a new call. it takes about 1 hour tops as i only get my roots done but they can't do it within 3 hours of closing?  i always overtip and am very friendly thinking maybe they will remember me and not go through the whole ordeal again next time but nothing works. i hate dealing with them- and look forward to finding another place that fits my schedule. only go there if you have no other options. price is okay but for mediocre color."
get yolanda to cut your hair. she's terrific. you will have to call ahead and have them put your name on a list. (she's that popular.)
"the haircut i received was average. i have really long hair and the stylist spent like five minutes on it. that said, it was okay. the real problem was the dreadful service. the stylists took at least two other people before me who had clearly come in after me and didn't have appointments. completely ridiculous! since i was the only person in the waiting room who wasn't a white male, i have a feeling it had something to do with my race and/or sex. avoid this salon and their prejudices!"
"took my daughter there for a haircut - it was ok, but she asked for layers and the girl cut it straight across and she asked to have it blow dried which costs $40!!!  she didn't know to ask  how much it would cost first, but $40 for a blow dry - they should have warned us!  not going back here!"
"this review is based on my only time at supercuts...i usually spend a lot more than what they here charge at a higher end salon.  i wanted to chop my hair off as a spur of the moment decision, and thanks to their online check-in i was able to see how long the expected wait would be so i didn't have to waste time waiting there.  i got to the location a few minutes prior to my estimated check in time but was greeted and helped immediately.  i had a picture of what i was going for and even though the cut wasn't exactly like the picture, i like it better than the picture i showed her.  when she finished she asked if i would like anything changed, and she touched up part of it perfectly (it's like she read my mind).  i'm not going to lie, i was scared to go as short as the cut is (and was probably in shock at first) but she did an amazing job and i can't believe how inexpensive it was.  one thing that is probably common knowledge to others but i didn't know is that everything is a la carte - the price is for the haircut only, and if you want it washed or blow-dried afterwards, it is extra.  one of my favorite haircuts to date."
"walked in and was taken immediately!! quick cheap awesome cut! i noticed a really nice of hair products line up in an eye catching display with prices very reasonable! i think the woman who cut my hair is tam. very sweet, smiley and funny. she was gracious and skilled. thank you!"
"i stopped in this place last night....at 15 minutes til close....i was met with great hospitality by the manager.  usually when i go to these ""franchise cuts"" places i am met with apprehension because of the texture of my hair and the definition in my cut.well, the manager was super nice and accomodating.  she made me feel like an old friend.  first, she knew it would be more than 15 minutes, no frustration.  second, she went ober everything in detail before cutting.  she made sure she had a understanding.  ran it back to me like she was taking my order (i.e. ok, let me make sure i have this right, you want......).  third, she understood my misinterpretation and mis-understainding of ""hair talk"".  we worked by talking, pointing out.  she got it, all of it!  fourth, she made small suggestions of inexpensive tools to get hair magic! like how to get color out without damaging my hair for $5 total.  wowzers....lastly, she didnt do a full cut so she was able to give me a discounted rate!!!  to top off an already good experience.there was another lady ckeaning the entire time so the shop was well kept.  product displayed nicely, sinks clean.i was leery because of past experiences with these kind of places, but she definitely deserves a gold star.  i left her a nice tip!  not to mention, she was pregnant, so i can imagine she is evem nicer when her harmones aint going crazy!!  i think her name was yesenia.  not 100 percent certain, but she is the manager."
my boyfriend's haircut came out look more uneven than when he went in....hair around the neck area was left untouched and not trimmed...not coming back.
came here today because it was closer to me than my usual marsh and forest spot (love those ladies!) the store was empty but the two ladies made me wait twenty minutes until they were done curling eachothers hair. worst customer service .
i got my hair cut here three times. it wasn't horrible as i am pretty specific with what i want and most of it is just guard work. the staff is always really nice though. it's usually pretty empty here not too much of a wait but they don't seem to be able to keep employees here not sure why.cheap. quick. decent hair cuts. what more can you ask for from a super cuts. i will probably be back.
"yeah you don't get the luxury of a high end salon but if you want a quick cut, in and out sort of deal, this is it.  no product up sells, no frills, just a plain old haircut.  the girl i end up going to is super friendly and easy to talk to.  she gives down to earth suggestions on hair care instead of pushing products on me, and she cuts my hair so well.  i know it's just a trim but i'm no stranger to crooked hair cuts.  plus it's so cheap i just can't resist.  i know these establishments are just considered a ""chop house"", but if you're not into paying $80 for a cut, this is a steal."
"as far as hair cuts go this place rocks!now i am not particular at all about my hair, (like seriously not at all)so when i go in i tell them ""just clean it up"", or ""a little off the top""; i know sometimes i am going to leave with a ""high & tight"" and sometimes a nice cleaned up look. that being said , after coming here for ten years! i love this shop, they are fast and they listen and they always make sure i look professional when i am on the way out! great staff and and super cuts!keep it up, see yal next time"
to the little young lady who runs the register. please chew your food before you come out from the back to speak to me. that was so gross. also i could not understand one word that the asian lady said who cut my hair.
did exactly what i wanted in a timely manner! great job lindsay! thank you so much i'll be back!
can get a pretty good haircut here for not too much money.  you get in and out pretty quick and good thing is not lot of picky women in here with lot of hair and lot of demands from the stylists. mostly guys go here and just want a good quick haircut without a lot of fussing.... the prices reflect that.
the wait was non-existence and my stylist was nice and professional.  it did not take her long to cut my hair so i was pretty much in and out.  she did miss a few spots though thus explains the 4 out of 5 stars.  i will return as they are close by and i rather not pay 20 + just to shave my head...
just when you find someone you like they quit. never a line though and the receptionist is nice.
"that transformation though!! lol finally got my unruly long hair chopped off and i couldn't be happier with the result! trista is amazing at what she does and the place was super nice and clean! i usually hate going to salons because i get very socially anxious, but i didn't feel that way at all here! everyone was so professional and i knew i'd be in good hands with trista, so i felt very comfortable. 10 out of 10 would recommend!"
"showed up during open hours, door locked. stylist inside on phone, with a person on their chair. didn't open door or even acknowledge i was there. no explanation."
"i love this place. the customer service is amazing, the quality of cuts is the top, and the convenience of the mobile check in is super!i can't gush enough about the stylists either! they are so warm and friendly and i left with a beautiful cut and style! i will definitely be back!"
love the stylists here. all very friendly. needed help with hair products and showed me exactly what i needed!
this is the first time i have ever come into an empty store for a haircut with my son and asked to come back in 2 hours. mind you the store was empty.  i said i was unable to and he asked me why not.  strangest experience!  the haircut itself was good and efficient.  we left and the store was still empty.  guess that should have been a clue that they have poor customer service and nobody wants to get a haircut here.
"the haircut itself was completely fine, but there was only one worker when we came on a monday around 5 pm. she was cutting one persons hair, another was waiting for color to set, and she seemed frazzled that my husband and i came in since someone else had an appointment for 10-15 minutes from  then. she seemed nice, but we did feel slightly uncomfortable, almost like we were adding to her stress. about 10 minutes later a second worker appeared, and we were both done with the simple haircuts after 40-50 minutes, but it was just a slightly odd experience,"
"shea is a godsend. i can't say enough good things about him! i've had my hair cut at numerous upscale salons, and have never been as pleased with the outcome as i am when he does my hair. some how he manages feminine but edgy cuts on me everytime, and it's always something different. i won't go anywhere else. thanks shea!"
i have just been to super cuts for blow outs recently and love them. they make me look great for a lower price than any dry bar. i have had my hair done by a few different people and they have all done a great job. i don't know what they do but my blowouts last for days when they do it. very much worth the money. i love the products they use- nothing too smelly or heavy. heads up- they have a lunch hour rush so plan accordingly. you can call ahead and get on the list.
"they have barbers/stylists for 'ethnic' hair too.  all i wanted was a basic boot camp cut.  the young lady had me in and out in five minutes.  for some reason, even as a child, i have always disliked the barbershop experience, whereas i know others love it.  so this was perfect for me.  however, if you want to sit up and bs for hours, this probably isn't what you're looking for."
i moved to plano from florida and i am so happy that i found  a great salon. i love my stylist as he is patient and really listens every time as to how i want my hair done. great place.
"i came in to see wayne for a blowout, and i had a wonderful experience! not only did he give me an awesome head massage at the bowl, but a voluminous blowout to go with :) he is very professional and personable! i highly recommend coming here and seeing him! ask for wayne!"
"this store used to be really great but has gone significantly downhill in the last year. i recently went in to get my eyebrows waxed. while the staff was generally friendly, the woman who did my eyebrows made them uneven and left many areas unwaxed/cleaned. i'm not sure if she realized it, but the wax she was using was not even heated, which is why it wasn't working very well. she claimed my eyebrows were like they came out to begin with but i've been getting them done for 12 years and have never once had this sort of problem. instead of not charging me because i calmly expressed that i was unhappy with the product, i was only given a 50 percent discount."
"i had my hair cut here last week.  when i washed it i found one side was longer than the other.  i called and found out the schedule of the man that cut my hair.  i went back today and he said, ""it's the same on both sides.""  i asked the second employee who said, ""maybe it's a little longer.""  i left and on impulse went into a second supercuts on beltline and marsh.  kathryn heard my story, agreed one side was definitely longer and said, ""sit down, i'll fix it.""  she did a great job.  i will return to this salon in the future.  the attitude at preston and park was unfriendly - there was only one other male customer.  last time i go there."
"it's really difficult to find hair salons that are affordable, with stylists who know what they're doing and actually listen to you. usually, i find you can expect to pay a ton of money for a really great cut, so this place was a pleasant surprise.i've been to several supercuts in the area and this location is by far the best. there was no wait at all. elizabeth cut my hair today and she was awesome. she listened to me when i told her the type of cut i wanted and she took her time to do the right job. she made sure she blew my hair out and didn't leave me with a bunch of wet hair all over my clothes. most places are so quick to get you in an out they don't bother with the extras. i'm extremely pleased with the cut i received here and will definitely go back again to maintain the style. a+++ all around!"
"i don't get my haircut nearly as regularly as a gal should, maybe. but recently, my hair decided it wanted to grow out just as terribly as possible.   i went ahead and downloaded the app in order to check in online ahead of time. i'm glad i did because it does seem to assist the staff versus calling ahead or walking in. the reason behind this is it sounds as though they are a bit short staffed right now. every time someone called in to inquire on wait times or to put their name down on the list, there was no receptionist to handle those calls. the stylists had to pause in the middle of their respective cuts multiple times due to high call volumes. i'm by no means upset, but just recommending for their sanity (and yours), i do think it's preferred to check in online. i did so maybe 30 minutes ahead of time and only had to wait about ten minutes or so. now - as for the actual 'do - i've gotta say, bless molly. the first (nice) lady who was going to cut my hair took one look and said molly would be better suited to handle my locks. ha! i didn't take offense as i knew it was a wreck, and i wanted someone who felt confident in getting it back into shape. molly took her time (but not excessively) in making sure everything got back to even and healthy and fabulous. she was a great conversationalist but didn't chat my ear off either. all in all, she was professional, kind, and knew exactly what she was doing. she may be my new girl going forward! i will be back."
"new to the dallas area and didn't know it would be so hard to find a salon open on a monday! after making quite a few calls and no one picking up or most of them being by appointment only i found this place, decided to give it a try and sooo glad i did! aurora did an amazing job! i came in for a cut and style and she did awesome! she even recommended some awesome products to keep my blonde hair looking healthy! she took her time and really listened to what i wanted!! thank you again!"
"i'm here on business from pa. i desperately needed something done with my hair. i took the chance on going to this salon. gabby was my stylist and she was fantastic! she offered me a stack of magazines to occupy my time while she completely highlighted my hair. she was very professional, and when she was unsure if i needed toned or not she made sure to ask advice from another stylist. i greatly appreciate that! my hair turned out great! she even taught me a trick to curl my hair with my straightener! i would definitely return to her if i ever end up back in this area!"
"maria does a fantastic job.  i highly recommend this place, as the employees are friendly and professional!  a+++"
"never again! wanted to give 1 star but 2 stars for the history i have had with this place.i have been regular here since 2009 when i came to dallas.most of the girls are good but they keep changing.but my fav since i found out this place was mayra! she is the best! probably one of the best i have ever come across!  apparently she has become the store manager now!last couple of my visits has not gone well! her attitude has changed completely. not sure if its trump magic! lol.i am not white. south east asian (indian).1) last to last time i went with on call reservation, waited 20-30 min for my turn with her. when she got free she called someone else and left me out. when i asked her she said "" oh i thought its the other sam, i need to go for lunch after this so come back after 1 hour! i thought..might be mistake. went to next available person and got my hair done.2) last time did a online appointment so that i select her name and there is no confusion. went there and checked, other girl confirmed i am next for mayra. waited 20 min. some guy walked in and checked in. 5 min later she got free, and called that guy ahead of me. i was stunned!..did not know how to react. thankfully the other girl realized what has happened and told her i have been waiting for her. the other guy was not even seated yet..he was just getting ready.her response: ""well ..the system did not tell her i was waiting on her..if you can wait""i was like..#######!not sure if indian are not good at tips ..but i used to as i liked her work.anyways...i said thank-you and walked out! :-)will cut my hair myself with trimmer but ..never again here! :-)"
i have a crazy anxiety about finding a new salon stylist for my haircuts. i trusted the smiling face (gabby) that greeted me when i nervously walked in. gabby gave the best haircut i've had literally in many years. took her time and made sure she was doing what i had asked. top notch stylist. i even asked when i left if she ever planning on leaving there because i'd finally found someone i'm comfortable with. she said she had no plans to leave. very happy i went to supercuts!
gabby can grab my curly hair and make it right! it's always nice knowing that you don't have to cringe around a pair of scissors about to attack the out of control hair on your head.  i'm always confident that she's going to tame my hair and make it look great!
cecilia and gabby were awesome the customer service was beyond satisfactory they girls were as nice as could be and i got exactly what i wanted done to my hair they've made a repeat customer outta me
"cecilia and nancy are both awesome, i had my haircut with nancy today she is nice and did a great job. nice clean and friendly environment. would recommend this place to give it a try ."
"i've been going here for 7 or 8 years, and generally got a decent haircut. sometimes it has been good and a few times it was barely good but acceptable. one person did a good job always and i started going to her every time and was very happy. she left and i made a reservation with ""next available"". a couple times i came in for a cut and even with the appointment, the wait was longer than i could handle, and that was understood and ok. i came back another day. last time i had an appointment and walked in a few minutes before it. the stylist was telling a lady that there was one person ahead of her as i walked in, and she asked if i called ahead and i said i did and gave her my name. the other lady had taken a seat to wait. the stylist then walked over to her and said she was ready for her, to which the lady was surprised as she had just been told of a short wait. then she told me it would be about 20 minutes. so i didn't have 20 minutes to wait to get started and i left and won't be back. i'm polite, friendly, and i tip well (usually $5 on a $17 cut), but i'm done with this place."
"i told her to give me the ronaldo #5starservice thanks cici! she took her time and did it right, all smiles at supercuts!"
"just got a cut here . larissa cut my hair, and she nailed it!!! she is easy to talk to, listened to what i wanted, and delivered on a great hair cut, which everyone wants...the staff there is friendly, great, and welcoming. i haven't had a bad hair cut yet. finally found a place that is worth going to over and over again!"
not even 1 star. i waited for more than 45 mins even after checking in online. they do not even bother to check appointments in system and give preference to their existing customers. same happened with another lady who was sitting there for 1 hour and she left without haircut. they may be good if you are existing customer but not for new customers. it was my first and last time.
top hairstylist is mayra. totally recommend her. if she is not available you can ask for miriam or vanessa.
"what i like about this place is that the location is great and the staff is too. its a very busy location, so their will be a wait. which is okay if you have the time, cause there is a starbucks close by so you can grab yourself a nice cold ice macchiato to ease the wait pain. there is one stylist that i have learn to love, larissia. she does an amazing job every time, i have yet to be dissatisfied. with her clippers at hand and a fierce attitude, shes always cuts my hair with a twinkle in her eye and makes sure my hair is exactly what i asked for. ill be coming back, thanks!!"
maribel was great. she has been cutting hair for 12+ yrs and did awesome with clippers and scissors. i will be coming back to have her cut my hair again.
first time at supercuts and it was great.  i had no wait time and the stylist was great for being very new. i advised stacey to please take her time and not to feel rushed in anyway.  she showed great confidence in her cutting and will improve with tenure.  i advised her that i will be back as she did well.  great hire supercuts!!
nancy was awesome and gave wonderful hair cut along with a very relaxing head massage. highly recommended!! go for her !!
i checked in & waited 30 minutes & i noticed         people just walking in & being taken in ahead of me pretty lousy place to be ati am not coming to this place ever & will talk to several of my friends & family about my experience
"marlon did an outstanding job on my hair, which is a big compliment taking into consideration my hair is awful! marlon is a very pleasant and talented  young man! finally found my favorite hair technician.  thanks marlon!!!ted"
"simply awesome.   very clean salon, friendly and helpful staff, on time appointments and abdel is just outstanding.  i met him at the smu location and have been following him since!! kudos supercuts !!"
i had a great experience getting my haircut here.. i asked for long layers & face framing layers as well as about 4 inches off my very long hair.. karina did a fantastic job & i'm being pleased with outcome! she listened to exactly what i wanted & also gave me great advice when i asked her about the hairstyle i wanted.. she was very friendly & made me feel at ease.. also i came in during the last hour they were open & never did i feel rushed or my haircut feel rushed..i highly recommend this location..
"finally found a great place to get my hair done!! thank you beverly, you made my day!"
this is my second supercuts experience and first at this location. wow! this location is nicely decorated inside (modern feel) and natalie was awesome. at 11am on a weekday there were a few people already waiting for a cut so i am very thankful for the online check-in.  i see why this place is so popular and plan on returning!
"tl;dr version;great place. def worth more than the $16 spent. long version;although supercuts has a reputation for being a cheap place, this location is great. the stylists are super friendly & talented. i hadn't had a haircut i liked in years until i came here. 100% more than worth it."
"i've been going to this location for several years now. the staff is always friendly and the space is always clean and well maintained. several stylists have cut my hair, and each time i've been pleased with the results. abdel has cut my hair the last 6 or 7 times. he has many years of experience in the business and it shows. no worries when i use him -   just sit back, relax, and let him do his magic."
i travel extensively hard to find people who can keep my young guy haircut intact on this old guy. glad i stopped in here .. erin was very cool.. perfect in fact!! definite recommend..
"great experience.. i always concern about the waiting time when i go get a hair cut.. i recently moved to dallas area and googled saloons around me.. beside that the store was clean and shiny, smells good, nice music,have magazines and sport channel on... the receptionist told me that estimated waiting time will be around 20 mins and i literally waited for 20 mins then abdel took care of me.. i enjoyed the conversation with him and was the best hair cut i ever had for 16 dollars only!!! second time i went there.. i requested abdel again and had the same experience... thank you super cuts for having such service for that price.. i would absolutely recommend any one looking for a good service with affordable price to try them out.."
great place for a great price. natalie gave me a great haircut and was very nice. my hair is curly and not easy to handle but i love what she did. i showed her a picture and she did her magic. i will definitely be going back.
"this place is phenomenal! home away from home 100%! my husband and i absolutely refuse to take our hair business anywhere else! the stylist are extremely upbeat with warm and welcoming professionalism. all though they do perfect with making sure you end up with exactly the hair style you envisioned, if not better, it is definitely the staff that make this location so top notch. abdel particularly has been taking care of us for the past year now and we keep forgetting just that...only 1 year...i swear it feels like he has been a close friend of ours for decades! that's how comfortable he makes you feel as soon as you walk through the door! i never have to tell him how i want my cut and he never has to ask me. i love it! he cuts our hair exactly the way we want it and provides top notch hospitality at the same time! he creates a close relationship with from what i have noticed all of his clientele in turn treating us all like family instead of just paying customers! i have no idea how we would make it if it were not for abdel and his expert skills of hair styling and customer service. thank you so much abdel and the rest of the staff at this location for making us feel like nothing less than vip with every visit! thank you abdel!"
"tl;dr - go to abdel and everything will be fine!this supercuts is great. the manager, abdel adawi, has been cutting my hair for over 10 years now. he has a dedicated following of customers, some of whom have been going to see him longer than me. i've seen him with plenty of loyal female customers, but he has even more male customers who have followed him religiously from his previous supercuts location on hillcrest by smu, and who will wait patiently for an hour for him even though other stylists are open & available. i'm sure the other stylists are great, they are always friendly, the store is always clean & comfortable, but at the end of the day i'm there for abdel - all around great guy, very professional, and always gets my hair right every time!pro tip: call ahead, because abdel almost always has a waiting list!"
hit or miss. prepared to be lied to your face about the wait time. i called in thinking someone would be available upon arrival. so i get there and there is a 10 minute wait time.  so i say ok that's not too bad. i wait for 30 minutes while the employees are getting coffee and taking their sweet time. they than ask me are you waiting for someone? how can you not be pissed at that.
"this supercuts location is a great place to get your haircut with professional services with lower prices. (i love a good deal.) i request abdel to cut my hair because he takes his time, puts effort into styling it and always asks to make sure i am completely satisfied with my cut and style. he is very professional, friendly, and most of all, does a great job cutting hair. even when abdel isn't available, the other stylists do a great job styling my hair. they are always friendly, honest, and thorough in cutting and styling hair. i have yet to walk away from the place with any kind of regrets. i highly recommend this place. hope this helps!"
"it's not often one finds excellent work along with excellent service but the staff at supercuts (preston and beltline) managed to do it. i couldn't not be happier with the way they cut my hair and the staff is always friendly, always providing service with a smile on their face. thank you supercuts.joe munoz"
"i've been going to see yessica at this location for over a year. her work is fantastic. all of the people i've interacted with at this store have been incredibly professional and helpful. i think everyone there is genuinely happy, which makes all the difference. they work well as a team and the store is clean and tidy. because they are so well run and the stylists are good, the traffic here is pretty high, so don't be disappointed if you have to wait 15 or 30 minutes."
jordan was amazing! fast and friendly. clean facility. would totally go back to her and this location!
"great place! friendly people, i liked the men treatment very much the girl took her time and massage my head for at least 15 min i will defiantly come again oh and i only paid $20 included tipi feel i am lucky i found this place"
i luv yessica my little stylist xoxo
i'm not sure why this place is rated this low. other than maybe rival businesses playing games. i've always been treated quite well and have been more than satisfied with my haircut. everytime. especially for the price you pay! would give ten stars
"ash is great! fun personality and i love my haircut! the shop is clean and everyone is friendly. fast wait times, i happened to come in during a busy time and still didn't wait long."
"would definitely give this place 0 stars if i could. sure, i don't have a go to salon and usually just go the place that's convenient but never in my 26 years of living have i ever gotten a cut so bad. decided to try this place out because it close by and my father recommended it.i usually do a comb-over with faded sides. i go in telling the hair stylist what i tell everyone. a 1 on the sides faded / trim the top, i do a comb-over. guy says ""okay gotcha!""i trustfully take off my glasses and go blind for the next 15 minutes.- he starts fading the sides without clipping the top up. that's fine, maybe a different technique. but then i start feeling him going at it near the top of my head, left side (i don't feel the same thing happening on my right side). note, during this time he is very talkative and jolly.- proceeds to start cutting the top of my hair. at this point i see an outline of my bangs and it is definitely missing a chunk on my left side.- he then goes quiet as he starts working frantically on my left side. almost as if he did something wrong.- puts on glasses and what do i see? he cut off at least 5 inches of the 6 inches i had. i have about 1 inch of hair. i have one hair style and that is spiky. i can't comb over. there's no part. the fade line is slanted. oh and there's hair missing on my left side. everything is lopsided. all in all. 0/5 would not go back."
"i had the worst hair cut i've ever gotten at this facility. i wasn't going to write a review because these things happen and it's just part of life. but just a moment ago my wife looks at the back of my head and says ""your hair line on your neck is crooked"" looked in the mirror and sure enough was, that was the last straw. the lady cutting my hair seemed like she a super basic knowledge and didn't care one bit. wish i could get my money back, not worth the frustration."
"i love this place. the customer service is amazing, the quality of cuts is the top, and the convenience of the mobile check in is super!i can't gush enough about the stylists either! they are so warm and friendly and sooooo sweet! i left with a beautiful cut! i will definitely be back! thanks for taking care of my curls!"
i love this location! everyone greated me as soon as i came in and i got exactly what i asked for.
went there to get shampoo and blow dry plus trim. an indian lady asked me how i would like my hair blow dryed? im confused....how many ways are there to blow dry hair. there was an asian lady standing next to her who was no help. had to leave and try to find another place.
ashley gave me and my daughter great hair cuts.  will be going back.
"extremely unprofessional staff. they never greet the client. staff has often been rude in the past. not sure why. staff fight for clients, in front of the clients. i am a professional as well, and would never do that to my clients. extremely disappointed. won't visit again."
went in for a trim.  told sima multiple times just a trim do not want short!  she does not listen and cuts it short.   by the tim she has taken the first snip it is to late for us to fix we have to go with the short.  if you go there do not use sima.  we will never go there again.
a head-turning haircut with on-line check-in? is this affiliated with the tony cvs health brand.why this supercuts is a winner:nothing can make a meh day into i have arrived day faster than a great haircut at a fair and reasonable price. remember to tip generously!the stylist are intuitive and do not require a lot of coaching. you will look twenty years younger in minutes.sparkling clean surfaces and floors with no antiseptic smells.it does not rely on cheap gimmicks to get customers in the door. dallas and collin county citizens have high standards and they are delivered on here. flying someone soon? get a haircut here and the flight crew will bump you into first class because you look dallas.ethic hair invites what we all know - more options for a saucy and sexy new look.all age groups including those memory challenged are welcomed and treated with respect and honor here. not to mention a flattering or updated haircut.comfortable waiting areas with new magazines!great air conditioning and abundant parking!saturday and sunday hours respect your busy work week.the general vibe is comfort meets style meets skilled staff!
"cut my hair way shorter then what i asked for. guys beware. i repeatedly said about 5 times to leave it long on top, but in the end everything was short and way out of style. that's why i cut my own hair for 5+ years. i never trusted anyone to do it right but i gave in this time and i sorely regret it. also, i was sat in a previous client's chair without any sort of cleaning of the chair or floor around it. yuck! besides that, the actual haircut was what i disliked. $20 for a bad haircut is a little too pricey."
first time going to supercuts. on-line check-in was easy. got an excellent haircut from rodney.
"second time i called for appt second time i was told 20 minutes, second time i waited over an hour and still no haircut. awful"
came into town for a business trip and i needed a trim to be presentable the next day.  rodney was incredibly professional and sharp with his scissors.  thank you for the great haircut.
lisa & rodney are by far the best two people there!
excellent hair cut!  great conversation!! reasonable prices!!!
"if your wanting great service, ask for rodney!  always offers a smile and great conversation.  and once he starts with your cut, you're done in no time.  he has cut my hair for two yrs now.  my wife went to try him out and he now cuts her hair regularly.  incredible guy.  ask for him, you won't regret it!"
"took guy and jason's advice and went to see rodney for a haircut.  they were right, rodney is great!!!  my hair hasn't looked this good in a very long time.   he listened to what i wanted and cut it perfectly.  thanks rodney!!!"
"i went in with long hair to get a short cut. i took photos and told them how 2 years ago i'd paid $75 for the awfulest haircut i've ever had. i left super cuts with the second ""awfulest"". i took photos that should have made it easy to imitate the cut i wanted.  jenny told me she could do that cut.  i am blind without my glasses, as in i see a blob in the mirror that might be me or might be a tree.  when  i expressed trepidation about the cut after she'd finished and i put on my glasses, jenny told me, ""that style too young (pointing to my phone with  the photo of the haircut i wanted) - you need more ....mature"". i paid and left.  i was too upset to speak. i was afraid i'd cry if i spoke.  stupid me was so stunned i even left a tip. do not ever ever use a stylist who with thinks they know better and cuts what they want without telling you first. jenny was that butcher. my hair today, the next morning, has chunks in it that look as if she cut it with a dull sheep shears. i will not go back to get it fixed because its already shorter than i asked for. any shorter and it will be a mans' cut. so i'm back to crappy hair until this mess grows out enough to try again to find a decent stylist.  i'm sick of bad hair and sick of egotistical professionals."
"based on the actual hair cuts we received i would rate this place a 5 star.   i can't give it that rating because of how dirty the store was.  they actually sat my son in a chair that still had hair from their previous client all over the it and the floor.  considering that this is a major violation and extremely unsanitary, i will never go back!"
"when my roommate said he needed a haircut, i didn't think twice about recommending this place.  when he looked it up online, he expressed concerns about going here, as the reviews for this establishment were very poor.  i was very surprised to hear this, so i decided to write my own review.i've been frequenting this establishment for over a year now and have had nothing but good experiences here.  mayra is my favorite hairdresser, but all of the ladies i've seen here are very competent.  every time i've been here, i've been greeted when i entered the store, all of the ladies are very polite and have a professional demeanor.  i normally go on sundays, first thing in the morning, so the wait time has been minimal.  my normal routine is to get my hair washed, conditioned, cut, blow dried, and flat ironed.  this runs about $25.  i find this a reasonable price to pay to walk out of there with great looking hair.the store is clean, friendly atmosphere.  if you are looking for a place to offer you wine and rub your feet while you wait, this is not the place for you.  if you want a great haircut for a reasonable price, ask for mayra.  you can thank me later."
busy place with only 1 barber. web check in is a good idea. staff always look frustrated and in rush to serve everyone. will get a good haircut if the barber is in good mood. not my preferred place if i need to be get ready for some important appointment or anniversary
love this salon! the stylists are so upbeat and always know how to take good care of my hair! they are definitely hair doctors that know their products! best hair cut and will always return!
had a good experience. my hair was tended by jasmine and she cut my hair exactly the way i wanted it to be cut.
"terrible experience.  unprofessional personnel, old dirty appearance, unsanitary people and equipment.  i'm a guy w the easiest haircut in world. somehow this girl screwed it up. haven't had a haircut this bad in 10 years. she was eating when i came in and screamed from the back of the empty store she was coming. took about 10 minutes to get to me. didn't see her wash her hands. she used clippers that actually pulled my hair when she started using them. after my reaction she changed the head saying the earlier customer complained but she thought it was just him. she trimmed high over my ears. looks terrible."
"well, i was contacted by someone from supercuts after my previous review. i was asked for my home address so that i could be refunded for my haircut. it has been well over a month (my hair finally grew back) and i have not received any refund. i'm not surprised at all. if you need a inexpensive haircut close by, go to nidia at great clips in irving. she made me presentable after i was butchered at supercuts."
wow. i went in for a haircut. there was 1 other man waiting for his. the lady said i needed an appointment because there was a 4 hour wait! there was 1 person in the whole place!  0 stars!
"had haircut before and it was okay so i tried again and they do unfinished hair cut, right and left side cut looks different, new hair artist most times i guess that's how corporate hair salon works. wouldn't recommend."
"you can't beat a good haircut at their price.i've been going here for years, and with the exception of one lady, all of the stylists are fantastic.be sure to put their number in your cell phone so you can call ahead and get on the list in the event there's a wait!"
just stopped in for hair gel waited 20 minutes. employees have no idea what they are talking about or doing. go to floyds!
i've been to this location before and the haircut it's been ok but this last time i left in complete disbelieve! how can a hairstylist that basically just came out of school (july 2015) cannot cut straight lines. hairstylist contreras may seem shy and soft spoken but seriously the job you did on my trim on the back is awful. the sides instead of going down straight are v-shaped with an abnormally high squared back. please avoid this location or getting your haircut by ms. contreras! totally disappointed
"i started a new job recently and i am in a part of town that i am not yet familiar with.  and to be honest, there's not much around here to choose from.  i've been so busy, and in desperate need of a wig-splitin', that i figured i would knock out a haircut on my lunch break.  the partial disclaimer is that i am used to a mid-higher end barber shop/hair styling facility...but i don't think my standards are too high for some supercuts.  i walk in at 1:30 pm and i am the only customer.  the person who would be soon cutting my hair, turns around from a chair in the very back of the shop, cell phone in hand, and says ""umm hello? you getting a haircut?"" there was no wait of course.  i was escorted to a chair where even in the awkward semi-silence, i had to ask how they were doing, hows your day going etc.  c'mon customer service 101.  i tell the ""stylist"" how i would like my hair cut and the response was a ""gross face"" followed by ""wow, okay do you always do it like that?!""  yes.  the paying customer currently in your chair is saying yes.  they start the process and begin complaining about how dead the shop has been.  how they have been the only one working today and i was the 2nd haircut they have done.  fast-forwarding.  the work was halfway done, zero desire to give me the style i was looking for, and when i began asking for adjustments, the attitude was back.  long story short, its not a terrible haircut, but it's not 100% what i asked for, and i wasn't pleased.  the persons attitude was my main issue, like i was putting them out to do their job...that they spent the majority of the time complaining about.  if you are in an absolute pinch, and don't mind not getting exactly what you want (if you don't care - hair is hair) then rock on.  i just won't be coming back.  the haircut will cost you $12 but the attitude from the staff is free."
"took my son here today.  there were 3 ladies working and they all had a scowl on their face and were very unhappy and unfriendly.  when we walked in, we were not even greeted -- one stylist just sighed and asked if we had an appointment.  i told her we didn't, and asked how long of a wait.  she said 15-20 minutes.  well, the appointments started coming in, and we were pushed back over and over.  i get it, they had appointments - i even asked if i should leave and come back - over an hour later, we finally had my son in the stylist's chair.  she did not cut his hair the way i explained and even showed her.  there is no way i'll ever go back."
"although some of the staff were friendly it was a saturday afternoon and they were under staffed. the manager was obviously feeling the stress due to her attitude. absolutely no skill by the stylists when all we wanted was a simple wash and blow dry. doesn't even deserve a 1 star, bad tools and techniques, wasted money"
the worst haircut ever. very uneven. not even sure how these people got hired!! never go!
"average prices ($13 for a basic ""supercut""), but mine was done just the way i like it. staff was fairly friendly as well, plus i walked in and there wasn't much of a wait."
"without a doubt the worst haircut i have ever gotten. i went in for a simple ""buzz"" cut. five on top, and a one on the sides.... how on earth can you mess up a haircut like that? one side of my head was longer than the top, and the other side was almost bald. she tried to tell me that gel would fix it. wtf? and if the haircut wasn't bad enough, this lady kept asking me to take her 300 lbs friend on a date, the whole ordeal was extremely uncomfortable. do not go to this place."
what a dump!!! never seen a supercuts in such a nice neighborhood this filthy and run down?!?! staff was lazier and dumber than the toothless wonders who clean horse shit out of barnyards. 2 stars for cutting swiftly on my infant baby's first haircut. minus 2 stars for butchering his bangs worse than an 80's bowl cut.
"nightmare! the black girl doesn't know how to cut hair! if she were working at a black shop she would get booted out immediately. she cant cut! took a big chunk of my hair like she were practicing on raggedy ann!! supercuts you want to hire ""experienced"" stylists!!!!!!!!!!! not anyone from the street. you wont be getting my business ever again!"
"misty did a great job cutting my hair. she took a few minutes extra to make sure it was perfect. thanks, misty, i'll be back."
place is a joke when it comes to management and customer service.  will never come back here and would highly discourage others with so many other options in the area.apparently the manager left the floor with three customers waiting to discuss some training with another employee. will never come back here and would highly discourage others with so many other options in the area.
"i feel like i should make two reviews. one has a 2 star because i went in wanting no more than 2 inches off my hair and left with my hair completely uneven and cut about 4 inches off. i got home and thought to myself, well it's just hair and maybe i can go back and have someone fix it... i would give amanda 5 stars!!! i'm so glad i went back! thank you amanda for fixing my hair! i truly appreciate that you took the time to fix my hair and make sure that it was done properly. i really appreciate it.  if you go in to get a trim, be sure to only go to amanda! she is so sweet and really knows how to take her time. thank you again amanda!"
they are all very friendly and the service is great. cookie does a great job of cutting my hair every time.
"came and saw josie spencer to cut my sons hair and she did an amazing job! super friendly, funny and kept us laughing!"
"unfortunately, i did not have a good experience in the way of my hair cut, for starter's i asked her to cut 1 inch only and she cut like 4 inches off my hair if not more.  the cut was not what i expected for a layered look and she did not want to do anything further of the services i asked stating to save myself the money that it would be too expensive for me. and this was on week day where it's not that busy at all with nobody waiting for her. so, as for my hair i am totally dissatisfied with it but my husband did have a good experience with her and his cut look's great! but this review is based on my experience but i still wanted to balance it out a bit stating his experience. i would say for a man's cut she's great but possibly not for a women's hair cut ""again"" based on my experience. maybe other people have had good experiences but i sure didn't. now, there is a lady that work's there that goes by the name of cookie that does a great job on my husband and has on me in the past. i was just determining my decision to go with this other lady by my husband's hair cut, which was great and her availability at the time i walked in. i would say if you're a man definitely go with this lady and if you're not go with cookie or go somewhere else. i was very dissatisfied with my experience this go around. i will never cut my hair with anyone but cookie there."
i went there at 8:10 on 12/20 /16 for a haircut. my haircut consists of a number half of the clippers all over not real difficult to be honest with you i really go so they can make my neck square and everything look ok. they still struggle with that. it shouldn't be too hard to give me my hot towel but is the third time i having got it i'm done. bye-bye..give this place another chance once again i do not get my hot towel i should not have to ask for it i don't believe. you promote hot towels with the haircut i'm getting a damn haircut why do i have to ask for a hot towel.
we had the pleasure of getting our sons hair cut by josie! she did a wonderful job and was very outgoing. he was comfortable from the start and did very well with her! the salon was very clean and organized too!
"this is the best supercuts i've ever been to, i'll never go any place else. josie i believe that's her name was awesome!!!!!!!!!  josie was great, awesome and happy to assist me. this was my first time, i'll never go any place else, i'll only see josie, she's awesome!!!! great spirit, personal and very attentive to my needs, thank you for being awesome, great atmosphere, kind, gentle and just all around a great place.  thank you for bringing josie in she has really made a great impression on my family and i!!!!! we've found our stylist!!!!!"
"i just got the fiercest haircut from jason! i've had a picture that we have been using as a guide for the past few months. yesterday we pulled the trigger and added all of the detailed razor design lines and he even bleached and toned it for me. bar none, one of the best cuts i've ever had!"
visited this supercuts twice in the last month.  stylist josie did a great job cutting my hair.  she is very personable and takes her time.  she makes sure that the customer is taken care of!  i will be back!!  highly recommend this store!  manager jason is awesome too!!
i love coming to supercuts !!! the atmosphere is always awesome and i will always request josie  she always cuts and styles my hair super!!!
"supercuts casa linda has always been our go to for a good and inexpensive haircut without a long wait.  about 3 weeks ago went in, got in quickly but while waiting was entertained by a boy about 2 getting his hair cut and didn't want to.  the lady was so patient, nice to him, making him laugh through it and was able to continue with out him noticing or fussing.  it was then our turn and we got her also.  josie is her name, with a huge smile, out going, gentle and listens to what you want done.  i guess she is new to this location or we just haven't had her before but what a great addition to the neighborhood supercuts!"
"went in to take my toddler to get a hair cut. we waited for about 30 minutes to be seen. you could tell that no one wanted to cut my son's hair because he's young. there were like 3 stylists hanging around doing nothing. they had clean stations and everything and they were just chatting amongst each other. finally one of the male stylists called him back and you could tell by his demeanor that he really didn't want to cut my son's hair. my son started crying when he was sat in the chair. he wasn't being unruly or trying to get out of the chair, he was just crying a little. the stylist then said that he wouldn't cut my son's hair if it wasn't safe or dangerous to do so. that was a total cop-out. yes my son was crying but he wasn't wailing or being crazy or anything. he's a toddler who is not yet used to hair cuts so of course he's going to cry a little, plus the guy was a stranger. what do you expect? i don't doubt my son got an ugly vibe from him because i know i did. i won't be coming back here again. they should have advised us from the beginning that they wouldn't see him if he cried, instead of making me wait for 30 minutes. a total waste of time. if you have young children, don't bother coming here. they are not helpful, caring, nor considerate."
"shelley was awesome. i was ""that guy"" and walked in 15 minutes before closing time on a wednesday night and she graciously took care of me. didn't complain or roll her eyes- probably because she saw how bad i needed a haircut! i will definitely be back. thanks supercuts."
"great experience today with miranda. she listened to what i wanted and followed through *exactly* and with expert precision ... plus, she's just plain fun to be around. :)follow up: people! you gotta hear this! ever since i got this cut ^ i've had women *and* men tell me how smokin' hot it is. it's truly the best cut i've ever had ... and i've been to some 'spensive salons. dallas, anyone??? [i once paid a staggering $100 for a cut a jose eber... ugh!]"
"this place really deserves a zero for the racist way my son was treated.  from the moment i walked in, it was obvious they did not want to cut my son's hair.  he's 12, and they made a joke about him needing a wax and shave (assumedly insinuating that he was very hairy). the stylist and clerk rolled their eyes multiple times. the stylist intentionally called wrong names when we were the only people waiting in the waiting area.  after washing my son's hair, they did not spray a detangler into my son's obviously extremely curly hair.  we were told that we would be charged extra if the brush out took more than 15 minutes (which has not happened at any other store in this chain).  after rolling his eyes, he asked my son if he ever even brushes his own hair.  then, he handed my son the brush and told him to do it himself.  at that point, we left.  it was obvious that this stylist had minimal knowledge on working with hair in people of color.  and it was clear that he did not want to do it anyway.  the stylist was clearly happy that we were leaving.  i have been to multiple supercuts, and i have never had a problem before.  clearly, this is a personnel issue at this location."
"very clean place. walked right in, no wait. matthew was my stylist and i just asked him what he would like to do. ended up doing a high fade. came out looking amazing. much better than my self-done bathroom haircut. if you go in, make sure to ask for matthew. you won't be disappointed!"
"it seems as though all supercuts locations vary on service and quality. even when you've thought you've found the right location for you, they change things up with new people each time. therefore, i'm not nearly as impressed with supercuts as i once was. i don't think the hairstylists here are as knowledgeable as they could be. i was unable to get the haircut i had asked for twice now, even after showing the stylist a photo of what i wanted.this particular location seems to have a lot of stylists ""filling in"" from other locations. if you want just a trim, then this might be the place to go. if you want an actual style then i'd suggest going elsewhere."
"it took me hour and half to get the haircut. there was only one person working. ridiculous. very bad experience. 03/30/18(update): they have recently changed all the hairstylist and maybe the whole management is changed. now its more like getting a haircut from a $2 place. the hairstylist crystal is very unprofessional and rude. i miss ashley, she was the best. never coming back here.03/30/18(reply to debra)@debra - don't see an option to reply on your comment. the review on the 'wait' is not from today but i think a year ago when i originally posted the review. i came two weeks ago to get my son haircut and saw the unprofessionalism and thought maybe it's just once and i didn't post any review, but looking at your new team i don't see that changing. the standard has really went down and i was a regular customer here. i am pretty sure all the regulars feel the same as i do."
this place is down right awful. always has only 1 maybe 2 people working and i sadly learned they have no idea what they are doing. also they quoted we a 25 min wait and i had to wait over an hour. seriously save yourself some wasted money and time and go some where else.
"great service and great people every time i get blow outs, haircuts and color at this supercuts"
"same experience as the others- again tonight. i come here to get my sons haircut. 10 min wait turned into 25...and we have other places to be. hire more people, and those that care about customer service. going back to floyd's across street for better cut, service- worth a few extra bucks and not getting frustrated again."
we had a great experience of getting haircut for me by ashley and my son with jessica. they were very informational and did an awesome job on our hair cuts. we have been here many many times and love their service.
"hit or miss,  need to find me a decent barber shop.  some good stylists and some really bad ones.  long waits, fast food type feel."
"i had a haircut today at this location and it was a nightmare and if you are looking for a haircut i would highly recommend not to try this place and if you still wanna give it a try, make sure that you don't go for shelly lane. she was the worst and the most annoying hairstylist i have seen so far. the basic qualifications for hairstylist is to be knowledgeable about hair style, being patient with customers and not to be rude. unfortunately she has neither of these qualifications. if the management is reading this review, pls do yourself a favor by firing this lady and i bet that will improve your business.  thanks for reading my review!"
"i have never experienced anything like ashley getting her hands into my hair, thank goodness she had that hot towel ready for me when she got done!"
this is a great supercuts! elida did a great job on my boyfriends hair! we'll be coming back.
stupid online check-in. i'm one of 3 people in the waiting room with 6 employees cutting hair but they tell me it's 45 min wait because there are people who have an online check-in but are not here. so i have to sit here and wait for people who are not here. 0 stars.
"had a friend recommend bailey. i used web check in and specifically requested her. i got there a little early and was called quickly. the lady asked what i wanted and i explained i didn't like how chopped the back of my hair looked and i preferred that it was layered/tapered and i wasn't really sure what it was called but i explained i have thick hair and one length across looks terrible on me. we sat down, she starts cutting. then i noticed her picture said ""lisa"". she asked if i wanted it  blow dried, which i thought was included in the price because you can't tell how the cut looks until it's dry. anyway, i now have an awkward 12 year old's hair cut, all ready for picture day!"
"i went for a trim and a hair color.... i'm working on going from my natural brunette, (with the ends still dyed) to a more blond color.  got fit in pretty great, and the lady that worked on my hair was great and super funny.overall - great experience, friendly staff and a good price. i paid under $70 bucks for a cut and color - that doesn't happen in southern ca where i'm from!!"
"at least from my experience, the staff is super nice, and i get good haircuts for the price. it's my go-to hair salon."
"​this is by far my favorite supercuts and my go-to place for looking my best. as a hair salon, you can't find anything fancy but what you will find is a great value. typical haircuts are $16.95 and they do allow same day call ahead which is great considering we are all on some type of a schedule.  my only complaint is the parking situation as the lot is limited and i have to park literally around the corner and sometimes the walk can be a chore. despite that, no other complaints. if you do come, my favorite stylist are marisol or keith. they both are the best in my opinion."
"super busy location but really nice staff. parking is a little hard. reserve a hair cut spot online in advance. in case you don't tho, mostly men come here so the line moves quick. i am pleased with my cut! i even bought some great conditioner. will return!"
"after several months, i decided to return to this supercuts location.  the price has increased from $16.95 to $18.95, but the quality of the cut does not justify the price.i went through what i wanted, very simple trim my hair to sit at my shoulder, no layers, no texture, and thin my hair out a little bit to take off some of the weight.  there was cutting and more cutting and the mentioning of not being able to cut my hair on one side the same as the other.  i was a little worried on how my hair would look at the end, and it turns out i had every reason to be!  at the end of all the cutting, my hair was shorter than what i asked for (about an inch to inch and half above my shoulder).  i had specifically asked for shoulder length so i could still wear my hair up when i worked out.  there was no blow dry so i could see the full effect/end result of the haircut.  i was handed the mirror, shown short wet hair, and ushered to check out.  nothing i could do or say about the length because the hair was gone.  i went home to see the damage, a terrible, uneven cut, not the same length in places, uneven from one side of my face to the next, etc., etc.  it's pretty awful and humiliating knowing that i paid for this and i gave a $5 tip.  never again!!  i guess you get what you pay for, but nevertheless completely disappointing because this should have been a super simple haircut.  i will not be returning."
ask for mariselle. she did exactly what i asked. looks good! i also had a coupon which they gladly accepted with no hesitation.
"great service. great attitudes. great haircut. went in as a non-local, but was pleasantly surprised at how well i was treated."
"they overcharge! i got a root touch up that costs $40 at every other super cuts and they charged me $60! that's a big difference, and when i asked why, they said ""yah it's $60""um...that's not an answerthe root touch upwas good hence the 3 stars and not lower, but it wasn't any better than all the other root touch ups i have gotten at supercuts for $40i'll definitely go elsewhere in the future."
"so....i have been coming to this place since i was little....there were my experimental years, where i was trying out different places ...which always left me less than satisfied with my hair. then one day, i was like ""i'm going back to the last place that got my hair right"" and there you go....went back to my childhood neighborhood, a little farther than where i live now, but always worth it.    i have had a couple of different stylists over the years....and i feel like each one gets better. the last few times, i went with taylor g. and what an artist! i have a lot of really thick hair....but taylor has never complained ! ( people have complained all my life) ...i always go with a picture of what i want, and taylor always gets a feel for what i want, and asks me how i feel about the do every step of the way, to get it right. personalizes it to my own hair thickness/ shape/ tips ....i tell her what i like, and she works her magic! for the most part i trust all the stylists. i really recommend taylor ! plus theres restaurants nearby and a starbucks right next door!"
"i had never been to a supercuts before yesterday, but i didn't realize that their clientele are mostly men until i walked into the salon and the only women i saw were the stylists. i have very long hair and have very specific expectations for it, so i was a bit worried that i had made a mistake by looking for the best ""bang-for-your-buck"" deal. at this supercuts, the basic haircut is $16.95 and they take another two dollars off if you're a student! however, my fears were allayed after being greeted by molly, who was both entertaining and excellent. i told her what i wanted and she told me it would be no problem, immediately starting in on achieving my desired end result. i asked for her to reshape my layers, make the ""v-shape"" of my hair a bit more dramatic, and to get rid of all the dead ends. my hair really looked fantastic afterwards, i've gotten quite a few compliments in the past 24 hours since my haircut!molly was fun to talk to, hilarious, and knew what she was doing. i would highly suggest you go to her for your next haircut, i know i will be!"
"i came in for a haircut this morning. i'd had an amazing cut from mary before, and my boyfriend loves larry but has never had a bad cut here ever from anyone. i got a cut from an african american woman today who had the 1st station next to the check in/out spot near the door. i told her it had been 7 weeks since i had a cut. my hair had a long layered bob to the chin in front and stacked short layers in the back. i came out with bangs, which had not been part of my hair since mid 80s. what i did not realize while inside (due to my crying from bangs) that my front right side is also layered high, shortest layer in front right same as the short stacks in the back. my left side is completely different, which could be because she was trying to finish and get me out because i was just crying at that point. this is the absolute worst haircut i have ever had in my life. how can you give someone bangs they did not have before without saying something first??? this will take years to grow out and correct, plus i have to find someone to balance the sides out because having 2 sides different with this cut is like having only one eyebrow waxed half off and the other being unwaxed. i was not charged for the cut. but, they can't pay to get my hair back so i am stuck with hair i hate for a long time while it grows back."
i visited the supercuts centre on woodway square centre in houston.  this is the second time that there is no hot towel after a haircut. either the staff is ignoring it or the company is making fake claims !! i do not fancy a hot towel but what is promised should be delivered !!!
"i came here to get my haircut saved during my lunch break after the lady i first went to didn't do a very great job. i scheduled through their website and they were able to accommodate me immediately.  i paid $16 and some change and i was waiting to tip after the woman on the front desk scanned by card, but didn't ask for tip... so do they not do tips? anyway, the girl who did my hair was very nice, she kept a little bit of a conversation and tried to fix my hair as much as she could, which was definitely better than the first time. my haircut is more even but there were some things she didn't work on like the front of my hair, which i had to ask her to fix. she talked and acted like she knew what she was doing, and even taught me how to cut my bangs myself.the environment inside is lively, compared to other places that can be dull and quiet. everyone was nice and courteous."
i've never been one to schedule my hair appointments and like the convenience of just walking in. i have been here a few times and have always been satisfied. my hair is very long and thick and they take great care of it! my boyfriend also loves coming here. he made the mistake of going somewhere else and he had to come back here and get it fixed. lessons learned! the service is great and the prices are reasonable. however i would make a call ahead of time to see how busy they are especially if you hate waiting.
"honestly, i love this supercuts. i've lived in dallas for two years and it's the only place i've ever gotten my haircut since we moved here. granted, i'm a low-maintenance gal. i don't wear makeup, i own three pairs of shoes, and i don't like to spend more than $16 for a decent haircut. fortunately, i don't have to at this supercuts. sure, there are some flaws. they don't take appointments so wait times can be tough, but if you call ahead you can put your name on the list and they usually let you know exactly when you can come in to avoid a long wait. today i called at 11 and they told me that the next available time was 11:40. i put my name on the list, hung out at home for thirty minutes, arrived promptly at 11:40, and i was in the chair getting that black apron wrapped around my neck at 11:45. i don't think i've ever had the same stylist twice, but everyone i've had has been friendly and very good at what they do. i've never left this location unsatisfied with my cut. today i came in wanting a bit of a change from my regular straight, simple, just-past-the-shoulders hair. i showed mario a few pictures of what i was thinking of and he said it was no problem. he was meticulous and professional, and 45 minutes later i left with a short stacked bob, feeling light and awesome, all for only $16 plus tip. these guys know what they're doing, and it's a great place for a haircut."
the hair dressers are great but the company is a cheat. i had 2years worth of points accumulated that they nullified because i did not give them my phone no.
"i luv this place! the staff is amazing! please call ahead for an appointment or you will be waiting! the location is very popular and a secret gem! they are always willing to accommodate you and the staff is so welcoming! the location is super clean, in fact i'm here now and two of the employees are cleaning! i have my regular stylist, which i won't share her name, since i'm selfish and want to make sure she does not get a line of folks. but, honestly most of the staff here has great skills! i'm just super paranoid, since i have long virgin hair. i just don't let anyone touch my hair. the price is reasonable especially since i use to pay $50+ for a haircut!"
"i absolutely recommend this supercuts.  the front desk greeter is always friendly, and the stylists are just as nice.  in addition, i began frequenting this location not long after i underwent an organ transplantation, so i had to wear a mask to guard against germs and whatever airborne debris might be in the air.  i was treated no less than anyone else, despite wearing this odd-looking apparatus.  when i mentioned my situation to the various stylists, they were absolutely understanding.  in fact, one stylist even put into the notes in my profile that the cutting equipment be sterilized, due to my situation. five star treatment, for certain, and five star supercuts location."
"i have been going there for over 20 years and still have the same person cutting my hair.  i wait to get me hair cut until  bobby jones is available.  he is great, a real nice guy.  try him you will like him."
terrible experience. waited 40min after checking in w 3 ppl coming in after me getting a haircut prior to me. 2nd and last time i'll visit.
"very disappointed at lack of service. arrived, put in my name for a haircut & waited while 9 other people were taken ahead of me -- supposedly with appointments , which seems to defeat the purpose of the shop to begin with."
i always get my hair cuts from supercuts but as i was in downtown i wanted to try a different branch. i have a very long pretty hair and not many people like to experiment with that. my hair stylist at this place also was not ready to cut it short. i wanted bangs and she was not very happy about it. but i insisted and she gave me bangs and a layer cut. i have been getting so many compliments for this new hair style. i trued getting bangs before but it was never the same. i love my new hair style
"i've gotten inexplicably good haircuts and highlights at this location for the last two years.  before that, i patronized a number of small, independent salons throughout houston where i got surly service and bad haircuts, at a significant cost premium.also, wait time here is generally super short, and you don't need an appointment."
took my daughter to get a hair trim was charged an extra $10 for blow drying her wet hair. was not told a simple blow dry not even a blow out would be $10 and it's ever acceptable to let a 3 year old leave with dripping wet hair. i am so irritated. also the woman took a very long time and in the end when the hair was dry the back is uneven. i've been coming here to get my daughters hair cut and each time the hair trim was even and i was never left with my daughters hair wet out the door they always dried it.
"do not go here to get your hair styled! i came here on the morning of my birthday party and asked for simple loose curls. that's it. the stylist sprayed down each section of hair with hairspray and curled it tightly with a flat iron. you could hear the hair sizzle and singe. she assured me it was fine. by then end of it (she had me faced away from the mirror during the process) i had what resembled a tight curly perm. i seriously looked like a poodle. i was near tears as i expressed to her that this was nowhere close to the loose curls i asked for. the curls were hard and crunchy and she brushed them back out and tried again. my hair took so much damage and i ended up paying the $40 and leaving upset with messed up looking hair on the day of my birthday party, i had to clip it up. later on after washing out the hairspray, i could see how bad it was damaged in the process. my hair is thin and always has been, but used to be sleek and smooth. now i have insane breakage all the way up to the crown. this is going to take a long long time to repair. save your money and your hair, don't go!"
"place used to be good. guess all the good staff left. there is now just one main lady there, and she is rude and nasty. she rushes through your cut just to get through more customers. she told me she couldn't cut my son's hair a certain way because her fingers were too fat - what?!!! she said this after rushing through my other son's hair while being disgustingly gassy. then she nipped him and said he was moving. i was right next to him, he wasn't moving - he has been getting his hair cut for years and knows not to move. i just drive further away for better quality service not just in hair but in personnel."
i would have given 0 stars but i had to give something. this place is awful. i went there to get my hair cut and dyed for a birthday present. i had just had a baby and wanted to feel pretty again. i showed the girl what i wanted done and she just didn't care or something because she did something completely different. she butchered my hair and the color was off too. i have to let it grow out now. it is hideous! i started crying because i was so unhappy. i will never go there again. i even completed the survey after leaving a review on facebook and someone from the home office contacted me. she told me to call her but there was no way to contact her! the whole company is awful. i have told everyone i know about the horrible job she did on my hair!
"odd place. not sure exactly what is going on here. stylists are sitting around chatting and laughing while customers are just -- well, sitting around. seekingly takes forever to complete this one customer, possibly an hour or so. in the mean time, i can't tell -- are they ignoring us on purpose, as in, "" watch how we are blowing you off! ha-ha!"" or perhaps they are not not noticing the customers, and they forgot they are not just visiting with each other.does this place have an owner?this is not normal for a real business"
"they were understaffed for a saturday. miss shonte got my little guy in and out very quickly and did a great job cleaning up where i hacked into his hair. it was quick, affordable, and miss shonte will be seeing my little guy and my mister again."
consistently great hair cut by shonte & paige. they are always with happy smiles & friendliness to all clients.  and they keep a clean store salon.
"marsha is amazing! she calms me. i feared people to touch my hair! feared it i say! but marsha fixed a botched hair cut a while back and did a beautiful job. she put up with me and my emotions so i only go see her now! i know she sees me coming too ha ha but she's patient, so sweet and does a super fantastic job every time. i even got someone else to absolutely love her too today. soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo yall are missing out! for sure! ask for marsha. mmmmmmk!"
staff wasn't very friendly. i got a trim and when i got home i noticed a lot of hairs that were longer than the rest of my hair. my hair was pretty uneven so i had to chop off some strands to even it out. won't be going back. you get what you pay for.
"this would have been a much higher review before last night. i've been here half a dozen times and, before last night, gotten very nice haircuts. last night changed everything. i told rose to trim my hair 1/2 inch. i specifically said that i was fine with coming back later for another cut if it turned out  needed more. well, rose trimmed 1/2 inch off the bottom all right. then she proceeded to cut 2 to 3 inches off all my layers. the woman totally scalped me. dont let rose touch your hair."
"ask for marsha. i've never had a regular place to go and get a haircut until i walked in here one day and she helped me. since, i always call and make sure she's working before i come in."
"marsha is awesome!!! i had 2 diff people recommend her and to be honest, i'm not impressed by most hair stylists, especially ones from chain establishments. but marsha knows her stuff! i have thick hair, and love layers. she cuts it right every single time and is very affordable. can't go wrong with her"
"1st time customer of supercuts....i am a black women and didn't think they could pull off the hair cut, but i was blown away on how good my hair cut turn out....shonte was very nice she also taught me to maintain my style in between cuts."
this place is clean and the staff is well experienced and knowledgeable. i do not believe that you should have to pay $50 and up for a good hair cut and this place is proof of that. i will be back.
"i recenlty moved close to this location. i am very weary about who cuts my hair because i have been going to the same person for years before i came to this supercuts. my first time coming here i happened to get jennifer. as you can see from previous reviews that everyone has mentioned her and they are all right about her. she did a really great job and from then i would always get my haircut from her. other than that the store was well kept and everyone was friendly.i gave this location only 4 stars because i called this morning and found out that jennifer is not longer at this location. i am not sure who or where i am going to go now, but if anyone knows of another person at this location trustworthy please inform me. very disappointed that she is no longer there."
"i've been trying to grow out my hair forever, but my ends were so bad i was embarrassed to go out in public.  even though i have an amazing, reliable, long-term hair stylist in my life, i dared to just have someone trim my ends.  i stopped in on a saturday afternoon without an appointment and they were able to fit me in right away.  the girl who cut my hair was sweet, but i'm not really sure she knew what she was doing.  she sprayed my hair with a water bottle and then proceeded to trim my ends.  i think spraying it and not washing it may have been the issue since i walked in with hair that hadn't been washed since the previous day.  it looked ok when i left the salon, but when i went home and washed it/combed it out - i was literally in tears.  my hair was super choppy and uneven.  right away, i called my regular stylist and booked a repair cut.  the cut was cheap (i think only $16), but even that price was a rip-off considering i ended up having to spend extra time and money getting it fixed.  my stylist kept commenting about how crazy the cut was, and because it was so uneven, i ended up having to get at least another 1-2 inches trimmed.  so much for growing my hair out and just trimming the ends! :-( never going anywhere but my regular chick again!!"
"#supercutsbe prepared to have an extended wait especially,  if you have already put your name on the list in advance. my experience with this supercuts has also been when you call this location from management  stating "" i don't have time"" then abruptly disconnects from the call! better service at great clips at bunker hill.  i finally found former supercuts hairstylist, manuela lopez there! :-)#supercuts1106silberrdhoustontx77055#greatclips"
"when i walked in i spoke to the girl at the desk and let her know that i needed to get my haircut and asked if i may use the bathroom. when i came out of the bathroom i sat down and started to wait and then a lady who came in after i did... i watched her drive up, got service before i did (the hairdresser knew her by name) then when it was about to be my turn again, a family of six walked in and the guy hairdresser said that they had been in an hour before and they were next. what's so funny is their name was not in the book but yet he was going to put them in front of me as well. i am very sure that they knew each other and that is why they were being put in front of me. i guess the salon does not need new clients. i will never get my haircut at supercuts again"
"this review is just for abi. i have thick, curly hair and most stylists just want to chop it all off. abi looked at the picture i brought in. took the time to discuss exactly what i wanted. made a suggestion that she follow the same layers as pic, but not cut it as short as i wanted to be able to put it up still. she ended up cutting and layering it twice after i decided i wanted a little more off. looks like a $50+ haircut, but was only $20! will be asking for abi again!"
love my new hair (cut & dyed)! great customer service! they take time to meet your needs & understand what is best for you. i was happy with the result.they also recommended me with great hair treatment product :)
"i have gotten about 10 haircuts here and it's usually ok, but lately they have been super slow.  the last time i went i was there for about 1 hour and 45 minutes...they told me 30 mins. cut was average, not worth the wait."
i absolutely love my cut and color from here! i'm very picky but this supercuts outdid my expectations. this location also has excellent customer service. i'm a regular and i've never been disappointed!
"my son and i came on a friday morning and there was only one customer who was  just finishing up, so no waiting. jackie did my hair, working from a picture, and she showed me what she was going to do before she made the cuts. she suggested texturizing and also styled the front the way i wanted. i appreciate that they didn't pressure us into buying products for our hair, but simply had them on s shelf if you wanted some. all that and a good price - we'll be going back."
this place is wonderful! great customer service and affordable prices for the services they provide!
"brenda did an awesome job cutting our 14 year old son's hair.  he has a ""callic"" that he plays with to distraction.  she listened to what we needed and gave him a great cut that he can spike up!  he loves it!"
i've been coming here for over a year now. i'm a creature of habit but why mess with a good thing. nelis cuts my hair just like i always do and i always leave with a smile. keep it up.
so for some reason yelp removed my complaint but bottom line the manager screwed up my hair a while back and it still has not recovered. matt and jackie are gone so there is no point in even coming here anymore. plus this place is always dirty. i just got this unclean feeling last time i was here. just save your time and money and go to a place that actually cares and cleans their clippers once in a while................
i walked in for a blow dry & style and amelea was my hairstylist. i was very pleased with the service and she did an amazing job curling my hair. if you are in the area stop by to see her.
"this was my first haircut in houston, tx. i had previous good experience from supercuts so i decided to try this location. my hair stylist was maria which was very friendly and easy to talk to. i am very picky with my haircuts and not easy to please but maria did a great job. my hair looks great & i got exactly what i wanted. the price was  affordable $14.00 and they offer a deal which is get 10 haircuts and get 1 free card."
"they always give me a great haircut. very friendly and always do their best to make my experience great! not expensive and excellent service. also, get the tea tree experience! its very relaxing and its feels so good! i always get that after my haircut....."
"first time there, wasn't all that great. didn't like how the girl cut my hair. i had to wait about 30 minutes since i didn't have an appointment. shampoo/conditioner is 6 bucks. my total was around $20 and my hair is pretty long. won't be returning though."
"i drive all the way from baytown, tx just to have my hair cut at this salon! i met jennifer 3 years ago when i lived at sawyer heights lofts and stopped at this location to get my hair cut! even though i live in baytown now i still travel 30 minutes because of the quality and friendly customer service i receive at this supercuts!!!"
last time going to this location!! they obviously have people that don't know what they are doing! specifically showed them a picture of long layer hair cut and ended up getting a blunt straight shoulder cut!!!? did not catch the name of the person but he was a male.
"it's the best salon i've ever been to. they are very helpful and make you feel more like a friend instead of just a customer. jennifer is amazing at cut, style,  and color. i wouldn't go anywhere else."
"this is a typical supercuts. it's a typical hair cutting place. i've never had to wait long here, without it being obvious it was going to happen as the waiting area was packed. i've seen people go ahead before that had an appointment, but that's not shocking. all the ladies seem to do good work. i certainly am happy when i leave."
"they don't honor their own coupons!!!the haircuts are just ok . .. the service is, often, not even that. i live in the same zip code and get supercuts coupons in the mail.  i go, and present the coupon, they tell me they don't honor those!!!!  i live just blocks from them.  i could walk!!   what supercuts are they for???  i am done.  might be time to support the local economy, instead of the chain."
"worst barbershop i've ever been to. they said they don't have #3 clippers and just give everyone who asks a 3.5?? also the barber didn't listen to me 5 times during the haircut could, and cut way too short. couldn't blend the sides of my head with scissors as i asked for, and did a lob sided haircut overall. wouldn't recommend to anyone. to make it worse when i complained to the manager who was watching the whole haircut she didn't say sorry once and didn't accept that they did anything wrong. of course had to pay the full price never visit again"
remember one name tommie!! by far the best stylist i've ever had. i have been a client for almost 6 years now every two weeks i see her. she always have a wait but it is worth it. i've told her for years that company doesn't deserve her. i am one of those customers that know what i want and won't take anything less then that. she does a great job every time.
i have been going to this supercuts for over 3 years now. my normal stylist is alondra and she does great on men's haircuts and fades. i've used a few of the other staff while my stylist is on vacation and they are all very friendly. i love the staff and the hours. also a new thing they offer is for you to check in online from a mobile app so i normally check in while i'm on my way. i've seen plenty of families come through and i've never seen an unhappy customer. give it a try!
"don't even want to give my experience a one star. this lady butchered my hair. honestly the worst haircut i have ever received in my life. i don't know how i kept my cool, and most definitely don't understand how i still paid her!  she can't do good lines, she gave me a bald spot and tried telling me that's how my hair grew! her fade is horrible she made my experience traumatizing. don't waist your time,money, or hairline. sylvia will mess not only your hair up but your day!"
"do not go here. they utterly destroyed my hair. i went in for a simple trim of my shoulder-length hair, specified exactly what i wanted, and also specified exactly what i didn't want, just to make sure there was no misunderstanding. lady cutting my hair indicated she understood, then hacked it off exactly how i told her i did not want it done. and it was absurdly uneven, and i had to specifically tell her to even it out after she was done. it looked like a five-year-old had done it with a butcher knife. i left sobbing. this probably serves me right for going to supercuts in the first place when i actually cared how my hair turned out, but i figured it was safe enough since all i wanted was a very basic cut. this was clearly my mistake, as i could (and have!) literally done a better job cutting my own hair at home with a pair of sewing scissors. i will never go back here, and the only use i could possibly imagine anyone having for this place is to recommend it to their enemies as a practical joke.edit: just read a few of the other reviews, and it looks like it's one butcher who's ruining it for everyone. older african american lady was the one who obliterated my hair. she rushed it like mad, did a sloppy job, and i still want to cry."
"i cut my own hair for a decade.  i know - not terribly stylish of me, but a short buzz is pretty easy to do on your own.  i should have started coming here sooner.  it doesn't matter who i get, they always do a great job.  parking can be a pain, and there can be a wait right after work, but i don't want to go anywhere else."
"waste of time. called in the afternoon cause i wanted to get my hair colored as i had an event the next day to attend. was told they were open until 9pm and that i could come in anytime to get my hair colored. so i plan my evening accordingly as i had to be somewhere tonight at 9pm. come in at 8pm and am told that they close at 8:30 and the latest they do color is till 6:30... sounds to me like they don't care about getting business, whether new or a regular customer. this place has lost my business and i will never come back to supercuts. over priced anyway for their stuff."
"i'd give this place 0 stars if it weren't for one of the stylists being nice, but this place has lost my business forever.  twice in a row i arrived well before their closing time and was told by the manager that they are closed.  meanwhile their light is on and door is unlocked and several still there.  i guess they'd rather go home early than make money!  never coming here again!!!"
"if i could i would give this place zero stars!! they have the worst customer service. they discriminate against customers. i brought my son in and it was clear each of the stylists kept ""conveniently"" bypassing him to take the next customer. we were waiting an hour and after they passed us over 5 times i asked them why we kept being skipped. they fumbled with their words said they made a mistake yet still took a different customer and told me to wait and it would be just a little longer! ridiculous... very rude! i will never go back!"
"i've been coming here for about 2 years and my barber/stylist.. whatever you want to call him.. is awesome. his name is aj and when i first starting getting my hair cut with him, he definitely took the time to listen to what i wanted and worked with me throughout the cut. 2 years later he's still doing an awesome job. this supercuts has just been updated and it's pretty nice. all the employees are very nice, the store is clean, and it's in a convenient area."
waited 30 minutes and someone walked off the street went ahead of me for total 45 min wait . go at your own risk to be bunked. really bad manager! i was not the only one that walked out.
"holy cow, i must say, this is by far the worst haircut i've ever had. i am asian and only recently moved to houston. whenever i move to a new place, i usually have trouble finding barbers that know how to cut asian hair well. usually supercuts hasn't done well in past locations, but i decided to give them a chance. i asked for a simple trim: #3 in the back and sides, and just shorter in front. the back and sides look fine since using a buzzer with a predetermined # is pretty impossible to mess up. the front though looks like the lady put a rice bowl over my head and cut around it. i told her it looked horrid, and asked her to fix it. she kept making it worse, and eventually i just gave up. i will have to go to a different barber just to get this monstrosity fixed."
"i came to get my haircut with rita and she did a great job! having just moved here from laredo, i was afraid to come in with someone new. she was very knowledgeable and really made sure i felt comfortable with everything she was doing to my hair."
seriously 22 $ for a normal hair cut which just takes ur 3 min. not going back again.
"well run, friendly staff, consistently good cuts. aj is gone, so now i usually go to taro. he's always taken care of me all the way down to ear hair and eyebrow trims."
"i've been getting my hair cut at this super cuts for almost 2 years.  i have never had a bad experience.  all of the stylists do a  good job.  when possible, i have aj cut my hair.  he always does an amazing job.  i always say that i will call ahead and make sure he is there before going, but i don't simply because i trust everyone there.the salon interior was recently renovated due to the staff winning some kind of ""best salon"" award.  you can't beat it for $14.95!"
what and under rated gem! coya's abilities and professionalism made my day. everyone there is great. thank you for a consistent store and inviting atmosphere.
"just had the worst haircut here by far. i been coming here for the past couple of months. and i dont have a preference on who cuts my hair. but today this older african american ladie literally cut my hair in under 3 minutes. she rushed my hair cut so she can get the next guy, this lady next to me finishes her customer, and my stylist told her to ""clean your station before you take the next person"" and ""im buying time so i can get the next guy"". i feel so mad that i even gave her 2$ tips. this wasnt worth 15$, i can get this at a $5 mexican salon down the street. so pissed, i felt like a second class customer, as if im not as important as the next guy she was trying to get. he probably tips her big. but i dont care, im a customer as well."
"i walked in on a saturday afternoon and expected the wait to be long but i was seen within 10 minutes. i got helen who was super sweet and did exactly what i wanted. she also would check with me before she did any final cuts to ensure i liked what she was gonna do which i really appreciated! she was fast but efficient and did a great job, will definitely go back to this location."
"it's a trap!the price makes it really appealing (it's so cheap), but there's no attention to detail. they just try to get you out as quickly as possible and don't seem to care about doing a good job."
gloria is the best hairdresser! don't go with anyone else!! make an online appointment if you don't want to wait too long.
"very impressed with the service provided by eunice! first the wait was not long, even though there were three people waiting. i had not cut my hair in a while and starting to look like a witch with long boring black hair. lol  so i requested layers. eunice walked me through the cut explaining how she was giving me vertical layers while keeping my length. cost $17 and coupons are available. i will definietely go back."
"don't let eunice touch your hair. she needs to be fired! i asked for high and tight with finger length on top. a day later i wash my hair and its multiple lengths on top, very short in the middle."
the ladies here cut my hair very well. it's walking distance from my work and makes it convenient to go to during lunch
"i've been coming to this location for 8 yrs, it's never overly crowded and i've been using michelle and gloria for yrs. these ladies are awesome. they know exactly how i like my hair cut. look them up the next time you need a cut."
"i needed a haircut in a hurry for an interview and tried this place out since it's so close to home.  i setup an appointment online and showed to see there was only one stylist in the entire place.she performed a rush job on my cut and kept looking at her watch as if she had other things to do.   when i indicated i also needed her to wash my hair, she didn't seem pleased.   long story short and to no surprise, the hair cut was over done and uneven.    luckily, my hair grows fast so the damage was minimal but, this is a lesson learned that you get what you pay for."
"i had been needing to cut my hair for a while but just hadn't gotten around to it. i'd made an appointment earlier in the week for a ""fancy"" salon but when i arrived they hadn't officially confirmed my appointment. so a few days later i walked in here and had zero minutes wait time.a lovely lady named helen immediately helped me and did my hair. she listened to exactly what i asked - 6-8 inches off and layers - and did exactly that, while double checking what i wanted as we progressed on the process. what more could i ask for? she knew what she was doing and was professional. unlike some places that charge extra for longer hair it was a flat rate which i really appreciated also.if you want a good haircut of exactly what you want and aren't interested in all those fancy frills like ""free mimosas"" this place is great. they also didn't feel the need to force product on me which i also appreciate. go see helen! great experience!"
"been a regular since moving to houston 4 years ago, but this place has gone way downhill in the last few months.  all of the old stylists/barbers have left (not sure if it's a corporate policy change?), and the appointment system is suddenly jacked up (2 hr wait with an appointment!?! wtf).  expect a long wait for an even more mediocre haircut.  time to find a new shop..."
"i had several good experience with supercuts at different locations but this encounter was just bad. i usually go somewhere else but that place was closed on sunday so i had to resort to supercuts. how hard is it to cut a guys where with clippers and scissors. i got home and noticed that my sideburns were uneven between my right and left. there were portions of the top that were different length/ ignored. although the price was ok, i would rather spend a few extra dollars to get a good haircut then have to go back home and fix the problem myself."
"the people here are very friendly and know what they are doing. far better than tgf where i went before. also, you can make an appointment or checkin online. but even without that i never had to wait!i totally recommend this place!"
"the good reviews say it all. i was looking for a quick haircut and was far from my usual tgf -a mixed bag lately- and... sorry tgf but you've lost a customer. this supercuts is nice, clean, pleasant and, very important in montrose, provides easy parking. i had no wait late on a sunday afternoon and had the good fortune to be helped by eunes, who apart from doing a great job with my hair is also a great lady: experienced, professional and a joy to talk to! will definitely be back."
"i saw gloria and she was awesome. i am african american, have very thick coarse hair and a pixie cut (of all styles). she was personable, very skilled and gave me exactly what i wanted. the only reason i'm giving four stars instead of five is because of the wait (but to be fair, i didn't have an appointment) and she didn't use clippers to edge up the back. no worries, my hubby usually does that for me. i will be back for sure. solid cut and service"
"i have been getting my hair cut a the this location for several months now and have never been disappointed. they have an app,which allows you to check-in on your way so that you are not stuck waiting in a long line, which is a huge plus. it seems the busiest times are the afternoons and especially the weekend afternoons. the stylist have always given me a quality cut and a great price, so i will be back."
"this is the best place in midtown when you are looking for a good hair cut, but don't want to pay the same price as if you were buying a new car. jessica is fantastic! i have been going to her for the past five plus years and she always does a great job. she will cut her goad however you ask her her to and you never feel rushed or like she is too busy to take the time to do a good job on your. i wouldn't go anywhere ales. great location, good parking and if you call ahead you can usually get in and out in no time."
"so, i had to be somewhere after work so i decided to pack clothes for the gym before going out.  well it never fails, of course i forgot my running shoes and i had wore dress shoes to work. just great!!  lol well then i needed to kill time and i have been meaning to get a hair cut; therefore, the logically thing to do is go get a hair cut!!  i walked into this supercut and i was greet by melanie.  she asked for my name and email to put me on the waiting list.  then, i sat down and patiently waiting for two people in front of me to get a hair cut.  there were two cosmological there and it was actually pretty quick.  melanie was the next one free when it was my turn so she shampoo my hair and started making conversation with me.  it was kind of nice instead of just sitting there in silence.  after the shampoo, she walkede me to the station and asked how i'd like my hair cut.  i explained it to her and she did exactly that. before she started cutting she made sure of the length i wanted too.  overall, i had a great experience here and melanie was super nice, friendly, quick, and professional.  i would definitely go back for a hair cut if i was in the midtown area or after work! =)"
"got a really bad haircut here yesterday. couldn't have been worse. lady apologized after. have them a second star bc everyone is very nice. in short, nice ppl, crappy haircuts"
"first time i went to supercuts and my now new hairstylist javier rivera was amazing! great communication with me understood what i wanted and gave me tips and opinions that i love to hear through the process of cutting my hair. he was well groomed, clean and had a great appearance, which is a good plus to me! i will def be coming back again to him!"
friendly staff great cutreasonably pricedexcellent selection of productsno appointment needed
"marissa is terrific! she colored and highlighted my hair & a cut. she was right on with her suggestions. she listened to what i wanted & took her time cutting my hair. i loved my color, highlights and cut."
"on saturday, i made the mistake of getting a haircut at a salon closer to my home. again...big mistake....really nice person...bad hair cut. fortunately, glorious was working on sunday morning. i quickly made my way to her and she worked a miracle, as always!  i started going to  glorious over 8 years ago because it was convenient but now i have learned that convenience is not as important as quality, patience, style and experience.  i have learned my lesson. #supercutheights #glorious #4ever"
i have been seeing glorious here for many many years and she is just that- glorious!!!  i trust her because she has decades of experience and gives amazing service.  i recommend her highly!
"in the area and decided to try this supercuts rather than drive the few extra miles to my regular salon...big mistake!i explained that i only needed a shampoo and then a trim to get rid of split/dry ends. this was by far the quickest hair visit i have ever experienced. i found it convenient until i got home and realized it was because the stylist didn't pay attention and missed a bunch of hair!! i still had chunks of hair with split ends and ended up taking my kitchen scissors to trim it myself. who has time to go back and demand a fix?!?on another note, the way the stylists were chatting with each other was excessive and maybe that attributed to the lack of care in my haircut. also, the stylist stood at the register while i was paying which always makes me feel uncomfortable like they're waiting to see how much of a tip they get. will not go back."
i brought my daughter here and they upsold me without asking for my permission.  i looked up and my daughter was getting her hair washed...too late to say no.  it's too bad bc her tipn would have been well worth it if she had trimmed her hair we originally asked.
did not take direction and completely botched my boyfriend hair.  they cannot cut tapper fades. do not come here for a tapper fade.
"by far one of the worst haircuts i've ever had the displeasure of receiving. don't go!! save your money. have your wife, cousin, random stranger on the street cut your hair before you go here, you'll end up with a better trim. so here is the rundown of what happened, and why you should never visit this place. i walk in sit down in the chair, and the entire time i feel like i've interrupted the employees goal is session. they were talking and making inside jokes the entire time and my hairstylist never really listened to what i was saying. i asked for a fade with a 1 guard and after she fumbled around for a min or so in her messy work station she finally pulls out a 1.5 guard and secretly slips that on thinking it will work. first the fade line is not even, there looks like there is patches of missed hair that just got passed up with the clippers. she also missed trimming the hair around my ears and my neck line. had to go to cutthroat barber shop to have them fix it. do not go here...ever"
"recently i've been looking for a new place to get a haircut in the area because my other one had switched to a different place. well i came across this location because it was close to my job. well i just wanted to say that i am very pleased and lucky to have found this location because kelly is the best. she does a great job on the style that i want and she's also very personable. although she does cut my hair very quickly, she cuts it the way i request it. if you do decide to go here ask for her. you will not be disappointed."
"had the ""anti-gray"" treatment for men yesterday.  i have had it done before, at another shop, and was pleased with the results, very subtle.  the treatment consists of finding the right color so it doesn't alter your existing hair color, only minimize the gray.  they are supposed to choose the dye formula based on your existing hair color.  apparently this technician thought brown was close enough and i ended up having my hair dyed.   it is quite obvious.  to supercut, if your technician doesn't know what they are doing then do not allow them to work on clients."
"i get nervous trying a new place because i've had some pretty horrific haircuts growing up but i've been surprisingly satisfied with supercuts.  they aren't the best cuts and it's not really for style or to impress but it gets the job done to a level i can live with.  linda cut my hair and she seemed like she knew what she was doing.  she was fast, asked questions, and did a pretty good job.  i was a walk in and had no wait right after work.  they offer the 10th cut free and give you some coupons after you check out ($5 off, $4 off, $3 off).  good experience and will probably go back."
"my hair is thick, straight, and full of more cow licks than a weekend at the lilith fair, so the fact that these guys can even make my haircut look competent consistently is enough for 3 stars.but the fact that they're the only supercuts i've ever been to that stocks current issues of wired, sports illustrated, spin, and probably a few others that i can't remember nets them an extra half star. honestly, i'd be thrilled by any thing that wasn't jet or ebony, but this is above and beyond. the other extra half star goes to the awesome staff. they're always talkative, but not pushy talkative. they'll chat, but they'll also stfu. it's a perfect middle ground. every single person i've encountered there is awesome. i would honestly give them a whole other star, pushing the total up to 5, based on the excellent music played, courtesy of each individual employee having their own pandora station, but 5 stars to a supercuts would be ridiculous, and i'd lose whatever credibility i had left after the lilith fair joke. but seriously. go get fro-checked at the one on 43rd and then come to this one, you'll see what i'm talking about. this place is the best supercuts ever."
"gloria gave me a great cut! the tea tree treatment was wonderful, complete with hot towel wrap. enjoyable experience."
"being out of town and needing a haircut don't mix well for me.  i have a usual stylist at home with a set appointment every other week.i was desperate, and having seen a supercuts tv commercial the night before i decided to  yelp the closet location to where i was staying.upon arrival, i was greeted kindly.  checked in and waited for the next available stylist (i wish i would have gotten his name).  when called back the gentleman listened to my requests, did a great job of keeping me updated, offered mirror to see the back multiple times, carried on a good conversation, offered shampoo which i accepted and got a nice cranial massage that felt amazing and topped off with a warm towel over my face that smelled minty.  all while laying in a massaging chair.my expectations were exceeded!  left feeling rejuvenated."
"so i just got my haircut from this location and i am writing this review still confused about my service. why confused? because this was my 2nd time using supercuts but my 1st time going to this location. my first experience was at the kirby/main location and my walkout price was $20 (not including tip) for a basic cut, shampoo & blow dry. at this upper kirby location, i walked in and said ""i want a shampoo, trim & blow dry"" and my total came to $58...$58!!!...for what i thought i was going to be the exact same cut i received at the previous location. whenever i went to pay out and she said the total, i thought i misheard her, so i asked her again. nope, she said $58. i was shocked in my thoughts but didn't say anything....but i should have thinking back on it. i even saw a sign by the cash register that said ""ladies special: cut, shampoo & deep condition for $26"" and i didn't even get s deep conditioning so i still don't know why mine was so much more. yes she did spent more time cutting my hair than the first person and i guess she ""styled it"" versus just doing a basic blow drying like the other person did, but i didn't ask for it and just though it was the way she blow dried vs. the other girl i had previously. but still, even if that was considered to be a ""style"",is that warrants a $38 difference from my original experience i had at the other location???? see why i am confused! i just moved over to this area so that's the only reason i went here instead of the other location. if i want to pay almost $70 for a haircut, i would go back to my fancy salon. ugh. only thing i can think of is that she asked if i wanted to keep my long layers and i just said ""you can, they are prolly all grown out so just an inch trim is good."" she ended up doing more layers than i had before but whatever, it's hair, it will grow out. still bummed because i was hoping to like this much more convenient location. i would also like to add that my 2 stars is based solely on the price situation. the location itself was nice, clean, friendly staff and played good music so just wanted to make that clear."
"i called ahead and the hostess said ""no wait"".  i arrived to a all the chairs filled and 6 people waiting. the hostess said i was next. then they took 3 people before me.  20 minutes later i was still waiting and walked out.  no one updated me or explained the wait.  i wouldn't recommend wasting your time."
the lady went shorter then we asked and my child was so distraught.  probably not going there again.
"i have been coming to this location on and off for few years as it is conveniently located but today was probably my last day. the ""stylist"" was in some kind of rush and had this idea of what cut she wanted to give me. in spite of repeatedly tell her she did what she had in mind and kept literally running through the job even though there weren't many people waiting. she was opening this drawer in from to take things out and kept banging my leg every time and didn't even say sorry or anything.  this place has steadily increased prices by about 30% over the last 2 years which is outrageous for a cut that lasts 15 mins at max. i would suggest guys to find different place instead of coming here"
been going here since i moved to houston and it's really convenient and olivia is the best! the app keeps it easy to check in and the men's special is great.
"i recently decided to try cheaper haircut options, and supercuts is about 1/2 as expensive as my usual salon. based on some decent reviews here, i think it's just very hit-or-miss, and not worth the risk.i showed up as the store opened at 8:30, and the stylist sighed at me as if i was inconveniencing her. she spent the whole time sighing and slapping my head with the comb. she argued with me when i asked her to make changes. she did not ask me if i wanted a mirror to see the back of my head; i had to ask myself when it became apparent she expected me to leave. supercuts has a shampoo option, but she didn't ask me if i wanted it. i unfortunately didn't get her name, but it's not like i'll be back. other people seem to have favorable reviews of this place, so just go at your own risk."
i got a haircut and the wait was not long and results were good. tons of parking and near a bus stop.
"i had dulce or dulche and she was rude. i normally come here and get jose who's wonderful but i was in a rush and he wasn't in. i sit down and she starts combing my hair and complains about it being tangly (my hair tangles extremely easy) and tells me about 4 times that my hair is damaged. i'm well aware hence the hair cut. so she cuts an inch off and i decide to cut another inch off.. she said to me with an attitude ""that's what i told you in the beginning when i said your hair was damaged"" and acts as if it's wasting her time if i cut more off. won't ever get her again."
"came here expecting the same quality/value i've received at previous supercuts. it was a mistake. in fact it probably soured me on the whole supercuts franchise. i used to go to supercuts because my haircut is simple, so i prefer to spend very little to get it done. supercuts used to be ""budget"" but still decent results.that has changed. this location charged about $17 (i was used to abour $12.95 at the sugar land location), and none of the hairstylists (all females) were friendly at all. if i'm going to spend $17+tip on a haircut, i'm going to go to a real barber. no more supercuts for me i guess."
i went by this location at 815p and they had the door locked i leave work at 8p this place deserves no stars
"i have been going to super cuts for a while to get my hair cut . and every time i went i was unhappy with the way they cut my hair. well i went to get my hair cut on saturday july 2, and i took a picture in with me for an example of how i wanted my hair cut. the lady who cut my hair never asked me how long or short i wanted my hair. she just started cutting and she cut my hair way to short. i am very unhappy and mad. i will never go to super cut again. i am done with them."
i went here for a while because i don't like to pay an arm and leg for a haircut.  ya it was cheap but it got the job done for two to three weeks at a time.  went through three or four different stylists before i settled on one.  everything was going well for while then it seemed like they started rushing through my haircuts.  slowly but surely the quality went down.then i noticed that they had changed the front desk person a few times.  i finally quit going after i had scheduled an appointment and when i arrived they said they didn't have it down and no more slots where open.  i let the first time it happened slide but after the second time i was done.  on to the next one.  it's too easy to find another spot to cut my hair and probably do a better job.
"i can't believe i went here for a haircut. and i can't believe i'm now writing a review about it...i chose to go to supercuts because i recently spent a great deal of money on a ouidad haircut and later decided i wanted to get some length taken off my hair, but didn't want to spend a lot at the aveda salons that i normally go to. i really just wanted a few inches taken off my overall length and thought - how badly could supercuts mess that up?i went after work, on a monday, around 6 pm. it was fairly crowded, mostly with men. they were very friendly and were playing 104.1 the whole time i was there. the hair stylists definitely seemed like they're most accustomed to doing men's haircuts. they asked me if i wanted my hair shampooed and cut or just cut. were they going to cut it dry??initially the stylist did not even ask me what i wanted to do to my hair; i think she just assumed i wanted a trim, but when i asked her to discuss it before she washed my hair, she was very receptive. the stylist encouraged me to cut my hair ""all one length"" instead of with layers (i think she really just didn't want to have to do the layers). after cutting my hair (which she did very quickly and kind of without combing it first...), my stylist had to help another stylist with a more complicated cut, so they had someone else blow-dry my hair. the lady who blow dried my hair seemed very nervous and used almost an entire bottle of straightening serum on my hair. however, she did a good job , so i can't really complain about it. the entire time they were cutting and blow drying my hair, they had it parted down the middle. when the lady was finished blow drying my hair, it was still parted down the middle. i laughed and asked if i could use a brush because that is not normally where i part my hair. she looked at me like i was crazy. really? how many people part their hair right down the middle??anyway, overall, i am very satisfied with the haircut. i definitely won't go back to supercuts for my regular haircuts, but it was a not a terrible experience. i would go here if i were a man...or if i had little boys who needed haircuts. the saddest part is it wasn't even that cheap. with tip, $50! i should have blow dried it myself at home..."
"ladies, do not cut your hair here! if you are detailed about your hair, don't come to this location. the lady was careless of my directions and just cut it even when i asked her to follow my slanted angle cut. the manager had to help her fix it! literally just cut your hair yourself before going here. it's no wonder i was the only girl in the salon. maybe it works for men but not women... just dont."
i have been getting my hair cut here for about a month now and have never been disappointed. there is rarely a wait and the prices are great. the service and personality of the stylists are great. you will feel welcome here.
i do not recommend this place. the hair dresser was not helpful. she just wanted you in and out asap so she could move onto the next customer.
"ask for the men's special w/ tea tree shampoo, its pretty relaxing.it can get packed w/ men getting cuts before a wknd, but service is good, fast, and friendly."
"horrible skills ,they cant even make the sides identical ,what an amateurs,just wasted 17$."
i've been going here for about a year and i'm always satisfied with my haircut. i think i had one bad haircut but never saw that stylist again.  always quick as well.  overall i would recommend this place to any guys.
"i got a haircut for $16. i paid an extra $3 for a shampoo, as i needed to go straight out afterwards for a meal. it seems the hairdresser i had does not care too much about the customer. while my hair was being washed, she used only her right hand and did not thoroughly wash it. i could see her staring into space (and not at my hair) the entire time she was washing my hair. as a result, the right side of my head was clean - i'll give her credit. the left side however was still had a lot of loose hair (see below). maybe she could have tried a little harder. side note, it didn't look like her left hand was broken or injured as she was using it for other stuff. i could be wrong, but if i pay an extra $3 for a shampoo wash, i'm hoping my hair is decently washed, and that the amount of loose hairs is reduced. when i went to pay at the counter, i brushed my hair, and you can see hairs all over the hand. only reason i am giving 2 stars is because the manager there offered to blow dry my hair as she can tell there was a lot of hair, even after washing it. my hairdresser said she'll do it and then resumed to blow dry it very quickly, but was not very thorough. after i stepped out of the salon, i brushed the back of my head once with my fingers through the hair. i had a palm full of hair (on the left). i feel like the quality (at least at this site) was just not there. baseline 1 star. giving a second because the manager seemed to be nice, and a 3rd total because prior supercuts from this place was decent. at this time, with the current employees they have now, would not recommend."
"never go here the lady was rude made fun of my haircut, rushed me out the door to go sit down and watch family feud and got annoyed when she wanted a tip.  she dinnt listen to any request to how to cut my hair and was very rude never ever coming back again she bragged she had been hear for 10 years worst experience of my life."
the lack of service at this location has gone down. not to mention the price! it's almost like every time i come the price in a men's hair cut goes up. i will no longer be coming to supercuts for the type of hair cut they gave me they were literally done in 5 minutes they didn't take the time to give me a proper cut and the lady acted like she didn't want to be there. what will no longer make me come back to supercuts is the service and new price. if i'm going to pay $17.00 plus tip i might as well will go to a real barber shop one that knows how to cut hair.
"this place is amazing! it's a very comfortable waiting area, and you're always greeted with a smile. the stylists treat you like family. kerri is fantastic. if you get her, you won't regret it."
"i was in need of a quick, easy, last minute hair fix before my vaca since my normal stylist was out of town.....so i broke down and decided to give supercuts a try. honestly, i was very hesitant because i am used to ""high-er end"" salons (that charge way too much for simple basic cuts) and a high end salon this is not......but hey, it was quick and fast and that it what i needed. i was surprised to find out that there was a location right across from krogers on main in the same shopping center as smashburger. i called before driving there just to make sure they weren't busy and she said they had 2 stylists working with no wait. got there and yep, no wait because i was the only one there lol. alicia (if that is how you spell here name) greeted me, got my info and told me to come on back. may i add, she made zero small talk.....barely spoke at all. i had to ask her name, ask for a shampoo. i mean you don't have to be all chatty but the basic simple friendly conversation would have been nice : /  and after she cut my hair, she took my cape off (while my hair was still wet) as i asked confused ""can you blow dry it??"" she replied ""it will be an additional $1."" i mean, she was nice about it but it just really confused me and caught me off guard because i just figured that it was included.....or figured she would have asked. prolly should have told her it was my first time here so she could have pre-told me about this ""build your own package"" kind of a thing. still, super weird to me but i guess its just a basic  in-and-out kind of a place......which i can dig.let me break down the pricing situation for you: basic women trim/cut: $16shampoo: extra $3blow dry: $1walk out price for my 45 min appt = $20long story short, i liked my cut so i would say it was worth it and that i would return again."
"on a tuesday morning, for $16 (plus tip) diana gave me a super great haircut! i like it better than my $35 plus tip haircut at my previous hairstylist in austin. she didn't wash my hair but sprayed with a spray bottle and ended with a quick blow-dry to freshen up. she did long layers, a v-shape in the back, and cut off the dead split ends. i wanted it kept long, simple but classy, and healthy and that is what she gave me. i felt she really knew what she was doing - very efficient and proficient.5ish minute wait as a walk-in. very clean location. conveniently located next to kroger and the its fuel station for my grocery shopping.definitely will be going back to diana for my next haircut! :)"
i went because of 9.95 coupon. they asked for your name and i told them i don't want my name registered just for a haircut so they said just make up a name so what's the point of getting your name?then she asked why i looked upset so i told the lady that of course because you insist of asking my name and i didn't want my name registered and get emails and robocalls and just mails to my mailbox. anyway when i paid with my credit card she looked at my receipt and said your name is ****. what a jerk.not coming back.
"friendly staff, fast service and as good as it gets! great new salon!"
"the stylist that cut my hair seemed like she would much rather be somewhere else from the second i entered. she wasn't friendly to begin with and sprayed water in my face at one point. at the end, she didn't even attempt to dry my hair so i walked out with dripping wet hair. (i would have gladly paid a dollar for my hair to be blow-dried, but i didn't know that was an option at the time) i've been to this supercuts before and was pleased with my stylist during that visit, but after this visit i would not recommend that anyone go for a walk-in haircut here"
"i came in for a quick haircut and only asked for a low fade on the sides(1&2). the stylist does a 1 on the lower part behind the head and the rest of the sides were a 2. next thing i know, the stylist starts cutting the rest of my hair(enough for a small topknot) before i could ask for a small trim and a thinning. my hair ended up blending with the sides and it was uneven everywhere. make sure you stop them before they do something you don't ask, or hopefully they know not to do something no one asked for."
quick and friendly service. never had any issues. and the prices/ offers are pretty good too.
"quick cheap and friendly service for men and kids. not suggesting this place for women, they are not particularly precise in the details. but overall great, if you need a basic haircut."
"my husband just came home from getting a haircut and it is by far the worst haircut i have ever seen. he was angry and frustrated because she couldn't get it right after he showed her pictures of his past haircuts. she did not blend at all so it literally looks like she took a buzzer to the sides of his head and didn't touch the top. he didn't remember her name but she should not be cutting hair. he is now on his way to another salon to get it fixed. absolutely horrific experience. i advise everyone to stay far, far away."
i had two haircuts at this place. wonderful experince. i will definitely go back. i am picky on my hair and i always give tips and directions on how i want my hair to look. they were very respectful and did exactly what i asked. you barely find a supercut to do a custom haircut for you. most barbers know some routine styles and they follow that. the check-in and welcome was great as well. i recommend this place.
great spot for a quick haircut. i have been here a couple of times and was happy with their work. right by tmc so very convenient to drop by while on lunch break or on the way to work.
"just discovered this location. it's very spacious and there are many chairs, which make the wait way less than most hair salons. very friendly services. and easy to get the look you want. would definitely come back."
"i came in today, with the knowledge that my hair cut wasn't going to be the same caliber at my regular salon but i this was the only opportunity i had to get haircut prior to giving birth. when i walked in i glanced at the pricing, noting that it would be 29.00 for a haircut iii. they were able to see me promptly, and as i was walked to the shampooing station in the back. the stylist mentioned the haircut costing 18.00 and the cost of the shampoo and product being additionalthe haircut was everything you would expect going into a super cuts. layers needed blending and were pretty basic, again this was what i was expecting. she then began to blow dry hair. she used a comb and parted it on one side and did brush it once she was finished. the only hot tool she used was blow dryer. this was all completely fine, and what i expected. i will say, the staff was very prompt and my stylist was friendly and my issue is not necessarily with her.the shock came when i checked out, and was given a bill for $84.00. after they itemized the receipt, i realized i was charged sixty dollars to blow dry my hair. they would not refund my money because it was ""styled"" despite not using a single hot tool.  i was told that the blow dry that is ""just removing some of the wetness from the hair."" i would have been much happier with the entire experience if someone had discussed this up front."
"i don't like to spend much on my trims. supercuts is nicely priced (i spent $20, tip included). this location is the nicest supercuts i've been in. the venue is newly remodeled, modern and fresh. the staff was very nice and i had no wait time. great place to go for a quick spruce-up!"
"growing my hair out for my wedding in march, but needed to trim it up to get rid of some split ends. told the guy i just wanted a trim 2 inches off at most. straight across the back. i have super straight hair so this task should not be difficult for a professional. walked out of there with uneven hair, jagged ends and 4-5 inches chopped off! i would go back and ask for my money back and for them to fix it but i don't want i lose anymore inches! time to pay someone else to fix it :("
i've been pleasantly pleased with this supercuts.... very friendly and efficient. i have a hairdresser however for in between cuts and basic salon services i recommend this location.
"awesome haircut joint, ask for tina!"
carolyn was awesome. i took my niece to this location for her birthday. carolyn was wonderful with her and took her time to get the cut right and did it with a smile. great job!!!
omg i went today there and i left crying!!! i told the lady i wanted my hair short in the back and longbin the front like a bob cut!!! but nooo she freaking cut all my hair to the shoulder length no long layers or short layers. i'm soo disappointed!!! never again coming back!
worst place to get a haircut. they have people with no training cutting hair . i took my daughter today to cut her hair and i told the girl twice clearly that i wanted only 3 inches cut and in a v shaped in layers. well she kept cutting and cutting because she could not get the the hair cut right. i went and told her she was cutting to much and she said she had asked my 12 yr old if it was fine. who asks a 12 yr old? when i had already told her how i wanted it cut. after my daughter having waist long hair her ended up shoulder length. her name is juliann ozuniga !!warning!!!! do not go here's
this place is great and yesenia is lying she didn't do it wrong it's probably just her because from what i know that hair cut can't be done without making the sides look smaller if she cut hair she would know that so you doing just fine julieann ozuniga just fine.
"always busy especially during lunchtime and after office hours since this supercuts is in downtown surrounded by office complexes. normal waiting time for walk-in is not bad, perhaps 10-30 minutes max since most clients are men and we just need a quick haircut. however they do have apps that enable you to check in ahead of time so the waiting time can be reduced. my go-to stylist is martha; she is awesome and gives excellent service. she ensure that she understands my needs and expectations before she started to work. i'm always very satisfied with her work results.once in a while on afternoon just before the weekend some women came in as walk-ins to get their hour plus full treatment before going out - dyeing, curling etc, that it backed up the whole system and some of us guys just have to cancel our pre-approved appointments. with the type of clientele they have (mostly male, time-conscious businessmen and professionals), perhaps it's best to ensure that there is maximum allocated time per client for special cases like these in accordance with the number of stylist they have, to ensure we all can get good timely service with no pushback or cancellation."
"the supercuts app does not work! i used it to reserve my spot, show up on time and was informed they did not receive my appointment in their system. i showed them my phone app but that did nothing for me. very disappointing!"
"gloria, the only good stylist there is gone now so there is no reason to go back. in addition, they moved it to the allen center food court where everyone stares at you while you are getting your hair cut and there is no glass partition like at hair places in the mall. it is like you are an animal on exhibit in the zoo. if you are curious gloria is now at norba's hair salon (116 pecore st) ."
"i live downtown, it's quick and convenient as long as you make a reservation ahead of time. they are always short staffed so if you walk in be prepared to wait a little."
"good, quality haircuts. pleasant stylists. great value."
"big shoutout to my girl maria molina. ain't nobody touching dis head, but her. she should work 7 days a week, just so i can get a haircut any day i want. :-) jk... anyway, i've gone through several locations and hair stylists before finding maria the great!! i've been in la for over 3 years, and super happy that i have this. my relationship with maria has certainly lasted longer than any of my boyfriends. that search continues! that's how i know she's a keeper. my hair isn't difficult to cut, but y'all don't know how many times people have messed it up. she can carry a conversation. nothing worse than complete silence while getting a haircut. this is the most convenient location for me. they're consistently busy, so i recommend calling to schedule an appointment or use their app to book one. also, this location offers a rewards program. earn yourself a free haircut after so many. one hour parking with validation."
super unprofessional lacking basic customer service skillsunorganized greeting customers when walking in seems to be the hardest things for the employees heresurprised they still can stay open much better and professional services availabile in the neighborhood not recommended
maria c. made me look my best on an important night! black tie event and the night was amazing because i felt good and i looked good. she always does an amazing job and does exactly what i ask for. she remembers how i like my hair but always checks in with me just in case i want to try something different. i always look forward to getting my hair cuts with her. at my last visit she recommended something called a flashback that would help minimize the appearance of gray hair and it was perfect. it didnt look unnatural. i'm not ready to age gracefully and i dont have to now. go see maria c....she is the one with great style and the amazing red hair!!!!
"i should've known better than to go to super cuts in the first place, but i thought how hard could a bang trim be? apparently it is difficult. the woman who did my bangs had bright red hair and pretty messed up bangs herself. she cut my bangs extremely short and made them all crooked and jagged! i told her i didn't want them that short, and she did the complete opposite. i've never had such a horrible bang trim in my life. extremely disappointed. do not get your hair cut here!"
"maria curiel (the little red head latina ) does my hair every time per my request . she's so detail oriented,   patient and a perfectionist ! i come out looking better every time ! she's a little hidden wizard hair gem here and i thought i'd share my secret !"
"maria gave me a great cut. i have a ton of hair and just asked for a trim to get rid of some dead-ends, but she threw in layers and did a nice job! i gave her a tip that was almost equal to what the cut cost b/c honestly, it was so cheap and i was not expecting such a nice cut. i will be back!"
"been coming here for years and always find a stylist that i am happy with and keep coming back.  for the past 6+ months that has been maria c.  she's friendly, got a great attitude, and does an excellent job with my hair.  and can't beat the price of supercuts!"
"richard is my go to hairstylist at supercuts weho .. he is the best , professional , courteous, friendly and most of all he listens and provides me exactly the cut i want ... i would highly recommend richard he rocks!!!"
unfortunately i will not be returning to this location. i normally always go to eric and he is fantastic and always gives me exactly what i want and listens very well. the past few times i have been missing him and i have been getting other stylists who do whatever they want. this past time took the cake and now i am walking around town with a mohawk because she didn't listen to me when i said skin fade. so she took in all the way up to the top of my head and took both sides in. not what i wanted at al and now i have to sport a haircut i literally hate.
"if you need a blow out don't overlook this place! i was in a huge rush and major pickle. no other salons could get me in and all blow dry bars were booked. i called them up with fingers crossed and they got me in!  i didn't know who was going to do my hair when i got there but i got erik!! he was awesome. i have so much hair. and i can say without a doubt, it was the most professional and perfectly executed blow out i have ever gotten. (and i have gotten dozens). it was total perfection. i'm not even joking. he washed my hair super well, separated my hair into pieces and it was done very quickly. dare i say better than a proper blow dry bar??? i would go back and ask for him again. and the price couldn't be beat."
i've been coming here for years but the service is going way downhill.  the new guy who has a buzz was a total jerk.  need to revisit management.  i think this is why all the good cutters are leaving.
"well... i am 30 years old, and i have gotten by far the best fade i've ever gotten in all of those 30 years.  her name is bethany, she is beautiful, talented, and knows how to fucking cut some hair.  hey seriously, i looked at myself in the mirror for eight hours trying to find anything wrong with that haircut and there was nothing, it was perfect.  she is the blonde with long hair and i for sure have a new hair dresser.  i have been traveling to her from korea town but now i'm moving to west hollywood and i'm excited!  go to her!!!!!"
"i had one really good experience and one really bad one so i gave it 3 stars it's an average, if i would have had my bad experiance the frist time i would have never gone back. lady with the red hair messed up my hair cut looked labsided then she cut it super short, thank god hair grows back and grows back fast (: ... she probably saved me money lol but i hate my hair cut this short"
"i love my stylist she does a great job.this review is only for the hair color supplies. how can i have a great result if you don't have the shades in stock. if you are changing the supplier, first have the new shades on hand and then discontinue with the old ones."
"thank you, maria molina‼i love the color and the cut‼ great job with listening and nailing my hair!great location, nice clientele, very friendly staff, clean shop!  don't let the fact that it's supercuts deter you--all talented hairdressers who are conscientious and want to please their clients!  def! going back for highlights with maria m!thanks again for the supercut‼"
"i've been coming here for years, and i was glad when i found richard after other stylists i used have moved on. he always cares about his work and is clear in making sure he understands what i want as he cuts. it's obvious that he takes pride in doing a good job, and i appreciate the work he does. i've driven out of my way to see him and will continue to do so."
"$21 per cut.  $16 tuesday's (add the savings to your stylists tip).had a shaky start but found a particular stylist i like, so i call ask for them and set an appointment time when i need a great cut.  there's a few very good stylists here who do a great job and are very customer service focused. if you find someone you like get their name and call and ask for them next time.  going in randomly is chancy."
this is great place for haircuts and the pricing is a real value. they except reservations and take walk-ins. there's never a long wait. staff are very friendly and customer focused. richard is my regular stylist. he's awesome and always goes the extra mile to be sure my cut is just the way i like it. i highly recommend richard or any of the other great stylist.
"i've literally had the worst cut of my life here.  i've lived in weho for over 12 years.  i've frequented here a few times.  (i guess i forget how awful it is...)  tonight i had an experience that will keep me from coming to this rotating door of inexperienced hairdressers.   where do i begin?  my hair is a ""4"" trim around most of my head - not too hard right?  then i ask the rest to be trimmed the same length.  if this is done correctly i style it perfectly how i want it.  how i want it is that i take a sharp comb and cut a part off of some of the hair on one of the sides forming a sort of strip of the longer hair forming the parted side, with the rest going in the other direction kind of messy.  a crucial step in making this possible is no 'blending' and also stopping with the 4 at the point of my head when it starts to curve inwards towards the center of my head from the side.  (ie shave the part of the head on the sides that is flat; but stop before it starts to curve.)  similarly in the back.  (ie stop before it starts to curve inward at the top.)  its crucial because i will often change my part from right to left depending on how i feel.  evenly cut with no blending.  tonight i gave these very explicit instructions to the girl there.  she nodded her head as if to understand, then proceeded to do a 4 shave all the way up my head past the curve leaving a patch, yes a patch of longer hair at the top - and on top of that the hair left was unevenly cut so there was no switching part.  making a pudgy face look even fatter.  ruining the style people are used to seeing on me probably for weeks!!!! the register asked if i wanted to leave a tip. i said, ""no, it was the worst haircut i've ever had.""  then she had the audacity to say, ""you can come in up to 7 days for a restyle""  restyle what?!?! unless you can magically attach my hacked head hairs back in place to start over... what is to restyle?!?!  i can hear it now, ""ok, how would you like to restyle:  do you want the saving private ryan or the ever attractive franciscan monk doughnut athelstan shave... because that's the only hair we have to work with...""so the bottom line is i have to style it as hitler hair towards one side (uneven hair) till it grows back.  and i have a job interview.  i'm sorry but an apology from the cash register doesn't help.  its like going in for a ball hair trim and walking out with an unsolicited vasectomy.  does an apology really fix it???  how about an offer to come in to restyle??  nope."
i always get a great cut here. both marias are excellent- tonight maria c killed my cut. thanks again guys xo
"i came here on a friday afternoon before rush hour.   i was prepared to wait the 25 -40 minutes as i have read from previous reviews how long the wait can be.  it is highly advised to schedule an appointment beforehand as i noticed customers were coming in after me with appointments which took precedence.  the parking shares a lot with vons and it doesn't cost anything to park.the staff were very friendly and professional.  the atmosphere was pleasant and simple.  on the ripoff scale, typical haircuts for me range from $9 to $30 and this place is on the higher end of $21.  they offer to shampoo your hair at an additional cost which i declined.  some haircut places have a vacuum at the end of the clippers to collect excess hair, this place does not have vacuum so my head was full of freshly cut hair at the end of the haircut.  for the price, you get a good haircut to meet your specifications in a friendly atmosphere.  the wait may be an inconvenience if you decide to go as a walk-in.  they also do not offer retired veteran discount when i showed them my military id.overall, i was happy with my haircut.  this place is legit with 3 stars!"
"i really want to give them more stars but there long waits really made it difficult to do so. not sure i understand the appt. service, 8 have made an appt only to get there and have to 15 minutes more for the haircut? not only that but when you call they'll to place you on hold only to forget about you. then you call back and she will apologize and make up an excuse. but if your able to secure an appt. with trish i highly recommend it, she is really good. other than that avoid this place"
been going before they were even there. always get a good haircut. clean and friendly the place to go for haircut.
my go to place for a great cut at a reasonable price.  friendly and efficient service.   check in on my phone and usually don't have to wait long once l arrive.
very poor time management! make a 5pm reservation and basically sat and waited for more than 30 minutes waiting for my call-ahead / pre-made reservation! explain what the point of a reservation is if you don't get served at the time your reservation is for!
"i've been to this supercuts location twice. my hair isn't overly complicated (shoulder-length and pin-straight), and i've been satisfied with having 2-3"" inches trimmed during both visits. my first stylist, sonja, suggested i try a new product that has worked wonders on my easily tangled hair. today, yeghine cut my hair and she did great job - thank you!next time i will make an appointment. the wait can be a little long here, especially on weekends."
"ok so i really have been avoiding posting a review on this page but i gotta do so now. i live real close to this location so really i go to it the most but i really don't have the desire to go anymore. i would have givin a 1 but some of the hair stylist are really nice. like linda and three others i see in there cutting hair the most. my main complaint is about the girl who takes the reservations with red hair. she never says anything unprofessional but her attitude shows all over! especially when the bussiness is busy. all the times i've been there i have felt unwelcomed by mainly her. she is quick to say there is no availability. doesn't even suggest a wait time unless of course it is a busy day she is quick to say it's a few hours long wait. i've had to sit there and wait on my free days. she doesn't even get my attention to tell me when it's my turn. i've always seen the workers get the next guests, even if she is at the front desk doing nothing but standing there. i came in on mothers day becasuse i am a mother who was having a really hard day. all i wanted was a simple braided hair style cause i had to work that day which i'm am a hostess at a restuarant and was gonna work a long closing shift.. the people before me where walkins! a man and his two kids i believe and only two people were sitting waiting. at the time mainly men and women with short hair who where doing trimmings where getting their hair done & most where nearly finished. when i first walked in she greated me with no smile. this was at 12 or 1pm. i tild her all i wanted was a quick and easy simple style. i told her i need to be at work at 4pm. she appologized and told me she was sorry that i may need to wait 4hours or so because of other reservations. i asked her even if i sit and wait? i told her i was a mother too and it was my day too. i had tears in my eyes cause i was soo sad i wanted to get my hair done. i didn't even have enough time to walk home and due it up nice myself. she said sorry but no. i said thank you and walked out. i crided and ruened some of my make up. i stood there and said you know what i'm not gonna let this un-empathetic lady ruen my special day. i walked back in and she looked annoyed. i told her to please add me to the wait list that i would sit as long as i could. i was hoping someone wouldn't be able to come in for their appointment and they could let me take a place. so i waited. reservations showed up and hot their cuts. then new walk in customers started coming in and were taken right away. i was so upset but kept my cool and avoided telling her how i felt. then 3:30 hit. i had to quickly run home and do my hair myself. i almost called off cause how emotional that all made me feel. she definetly helped my mothers day get worse than it was already starting and she probably helped made that my last trip there. i wouldn't recommend anyone to go there unless they get a more friendlier front desk women who knows hospitality skills and professionalism. even while guests are waiting for their haircuts she doesn't even speak or offer nothing like at least the stylist do when they aren't cutting hair. never heard of a place help reun a guests special day if anything i've always heard wonderful turn out stories but not with her. lol i even always tip real generously after getting a cut even if it wasn't what i was expecting. just the time and effort you hair take to help someone feel good is appriciative ...  but that girl needs more tranning or a replacement. i'm not the problem cause i see plenty of similar posts & its sad.. thank you."
hi neighborsi understand why super cuts only has two stars. wanted to get a hair wash and blow dry for my 14 year old daughter today. it's winter formal after all. tuesday i was walking with her to get an estimate. 30 dollars for wash and blow. when we arrived two hours before the event i was told it is 60 dollars. i felt trapped as it was last-minute and i needed it done. this was way overpriced for the service and go to world cuts in the bristol farms complex for a much better deal and service.
"i got a haircut today by this lady whom i forgot her name. the haircut was good , but as i went to go pay. the lady who cut my hair was packing up to leave for the day which was 2:55 but the receptionist rudely told her to come back that she still has 5 mins.. the lady who cut my hair was still being professional but asking why theirs only 5 mins left the receptionist didn't care and told her to cut another head now.. this bothered me so much because one the receptionist was not professional at all , and also made the lady look stupid and feel uncomfortable when all she was doing was her job. the receptionist is always rude when i go so i wasn't surprised but be professional next time and pull her to the side instead of throwing a fit in front of the guess for her doing her job."
always love coming here for a professional and and affordable haircut. they're always available in a pinch and always give me a consistently good haircut.
"i've had my run ins with bad hair cuts and poor customer service but wow do these people take the cake.the people here have to be the rudest people i've ever met. as i arrived to the front desk, the lady told us our wait time and we checked in. i asked the lady if they have anyone who can texturize my very thick hair and she immediately said, ""your wait time is still going to be 45 minutes."" then i said, ""okay but i just wanted to know if anyone can do that for me."" and her response was ""well yeah everyone here can.""obviously they can't even cut hair because after my boyfriend's simple hair cut (not even a fade or anything.), his hair was pretty choppy after she sped through his hair cut. we thought the lady who was cutting his hair would be nicer but she was just as rude. my boyfriend gave her a 25% tip and she just took it and turned her back to him with just a ""thanks.""she also called my boyfriend my brother even though we were holding hands and our extremely different appearances.(i'm a redhead and he has dark brown hair with darker skin.) that doesn't really matter but you'd think they'd make an effort to pay attention to the people paying for their own perms.tldr;these people have garbage customer service skills and the hairdresser was awful at a finishing a simple haircut."
"first off i really hate leaving negative reviews. second i especially hate ( yes i know hate is a strong word) people with no common sense who don't listen! i stated several times please don't cut my hair too short, ( i'm a male) i wanted to say please don't fuck my hair up!  sure as shit she cuts it too short as well as uneven. and yes i know it will grow back. i can feel my blood pressure rise, oh and she's fucking humming to whatever lame ass song was playing on their shitty station. note to all hairdressers/stylists, please don't hum while cutting/styling a client/customer's hair, wtf how do you not know that!!!she could tell i was getting irritated, did nothing to try and mellow the situation out.zero personality and no service skills what so ever, who the fuck hires these people. and they're everywhere! it's actually my fault for choosing such a low ball place to have my haircut in the first place. thought i'd try and save a little money and it's close to my home.  um...., yeah no! note to supercuts,it would be in your best interest to hire better people. in fact i would be willing to screen your potential applicants. i could tell you in less than 2 minutes if they'd be a good fit or not. however i do understand the caliber of people applying and it must be frustrating knowing that all the really stellar stylists out there would never ever apply to supercuts in the first place. again i really hate leaving negative reviews"
"i got a cut here a few months back by ruth, she's the one with a nose piercing. she was beyond awful. i had asked for a layered cut and before even wetting my hair, she went at it with the scissor. i'm no hair dresser but i do know that you can't cut across dry hair, it needs to be dampened first. i mentioned that to her as she was butchering my hair and she said this is how she learned it in school. luckily, there was a another hair dresser next to us, linda, who saw it all go down and came over and offered to take over. i used to be a regular there but since then i've been terrified of going back. it's not just that she ruined my hair because it does grow back, it's the fact that she was resistant to advice and acted as if she either was superior or just didn't care. i would caution anyone from having her cut your hair."
don't count on them to be on-time with your appointments.  expect 30 to 40 minuets delay beyond your scheduled time.  they just can't get it right!
"you would think a place called supercuts would be able to give descent hair cuts.... i was very wrong! my bangs are not straight  and it looks like a 10 year old cut my hair. the lady was so bad. she never introduced herself, looked like she wanted to go home, did not listen to what i wanted. please reconsider going to this place for a 'simple' trim. go to a real salon with professionals"
"i just wanted to give everybody a heads (smiles) up that carman and this shop is great. i have lived in many great cities and had some wonderful stylistics  do my hair. carman is on my ""mt mount rushmore"" of stylists. do your head and hair a great favor and give this shop a try."
we love sharyl! she cuts my whole family's hair and it looks great! she is very knowledgeable about different hair and which cut will work for you. the shop is very clean and the receptionist is helpful. an all around great location!
"i've been coming here for at least 10 years and have always received the best service, cuts, color, and conversations.  i used to see john until he left, then linda, and now yehineh (prob not spelled right).  all were always kind & professional.  i like to try and call ahead for a same-day appointment.  i never have to wait very long.   linda & yehineh are fabulous.  this particular supercuts has a lot of repeat customers."
"worse experience ever! to be honest, they say they don't take appointments, but by coincidence all the caucasians got called before us even though they came after us. wow. i've never felt so disgusted by a business. they should have said something about the fact that they take appointments. however, we were completely ignored. never ever coming here again. when we left, one of the employees rolled their eyes. so unprofessional."
"i have a strange haircut that is not very conventional - basically all short hair and bangs except for one long braid. i am in the midst of experimenting with it, and every once in a while i need to discuss what would be better with a hair cutter rather than just my peers. but twice already, two different hair dressers at this location have managed to make me feel very uncomfortable. the first time, the lady was very intent on me getting rid of my braid after she had done the color in my hair (the color was done well, though). i decided not to get my hair cut there when she was pressuring me, so i left. but then a few days ago i decided to come back and give it another try, but i was met with a very aggressive lady who would rather not have a conversation about it and became frustrated with my questions. it's true that i was indecisive, but i wanted to know her opinion. in the end, she began to buzz my hair when i was not quite decided yet and it was a bit too aggressive. also, it wasn't very neatly done. basically said, don't go here if you want anything creative done. or if you want some sort of engaging conversation about hair. maybe there are a few cutters here that would do that, but the others are not so good. you might as well try somewhere else."
"hands down the best hair crew in los angeles. i've been coming here for over 9 years and i've gotten to know and love these people.they are all knowledgeable about their products and do great hair. i've had everything done here from highlights, deep conditioning treatments, root touch ups, betty bangs, pixie cuts to layering my long hair.they know what they are doing. there isn't a lot of turn over in staff so the quality stays consistent. its always clean, friendly, with a fun vibe. parking is easy and free! after using their suggested products i will never be using drugstore products again. its affordable, smells amazing and keeps my hair from looking and feeling damaged. there are so many options to go to for hair in this city but i always end up here because i know i will have quality work done at an affordable price. its the staff that makes this place priceless. you can tell they all love their jobs, they all have tremendous hearts and do amazing hair. no snobs, angry faces or divas. professional,  friendly, clean and qualified."
"so the haircut was fine. nothing special but fine for the price. and they said ""you know a blow dry costs more right?"" so my bad for not realizing that it would be more than the haircut itself. the kids cut was 20. the blow dry was 25. 25??!!might come back for a trim for her but will not do this again. make sure you ask for pricing for every thing they offer. wash? ask. dry? ask."
"no wait, quickly helped. the gentleman who cut my hair was marco. he did it very well. i liked the way it turned out."
"this team is amazing, friendly staff, and they give you what you ask.  earn points towards a free cut, i have 264 points lol. thanks guys for all your help. i love my cut, by rob. jacky, mary and crazy tony.. lol"
"i have been coming to this store since i moved to la back in 1999. i think that should tell you a lot right there. i've moved two more times since then and absolutely refuse to go anywhere else to get my hair cut. vickie, the manager, has become a good friend to me. i trust her and her staff each and every time because i know they are extremely professional. i have been to other stores just to check them out such as rudy's across the street. rudy's is fine. no problems with them, but i miss the closeness, the personal service i get from vickie's store. always a smile on their faces, some cheesy 80's music in the background  (the other day they were playing devo's ""whip it""!). but be careful because they will have you buy every product in the store before you leave, the crafty salespeople that they are...ha ha! who cares, right? as long as the service is friendly and you get as fantastic a look here as you would at some glitzy beverly hills boutique. i've never left disappointed and always look like they trimmed 15 years off of my life. how can one complain about  a place that makes you feel and look young again? vickie and her staff are truly the best!"
vickie is awesome! she pampersme with her friendliness and detailedness every time i come in to do hair cut and color. she makes me feel more beautiful after.
"went in to get my mom a new look to lift her spirits up, and we got some help from tonee to find a nice shade to bring some life back into her. i loved the shade and the cut, and i know my mom appreciates it too. so thank you tonee we will definitely be back, you were wonderful and very entertaining! amazing work!!!"
"great service, great suggestions with hair styles and products and overall very friendly. parking can be a hassle with the parking lot not being very big and it can get crowded but its worth the wait."
the manager vicky called my name and took me to the chair i told her if she will give me a second to just go and wash my hands said no problem when i came out she was already consulting another customer and i asked her if i was next and she didn't know because there was other people waiting even knowing tha she had already taken me before so i waited and a girl tony very nice but cut my hair in 5 minutes i paid and left but the hair cut was not even and very short i was very upset so i went back to talk to the manager and that's why i found out tia vicky was the manager and i told her that i was not happy and she got money or of the register and through at me and very pestle walked away there for will never go there again
"please read this !  this is my first & last time in this supercut store !!! i booked an appointment online and went there couple of months ago and i got mary ( older lady with glasses) to get a my hair cut ! horrible experience ! mary's got some attitude & she was done within like 8 minutes and then i asked her to trim my beard a little, big mistake ! i think she has no idea how to do a proper beard trimming as she did it super fast without any protection comb attach to the trimmer.i felt a slight pain in my cheek area after she was finished but nothing thought much of it at that time.after i shaved my beard completely a month later, i found a big red mark on my left cheek and till this day it hasn't completely disapeared !guys avoid this place unless the management gets rid off mary and hire some new friendly barbers who actually knows what customer service really means !!!"
"i don't recommend men coming here for a haircut. the cuts are un-even, choppy, and not blended. i have been to multiple stylists at this location and it has been mediocre at best. the haircuts are not cheap either, with tip my total comes out to 27$. everyone is very friendly and welcoming, for 5 stars for that. i'll go with another location in the future. hopefully management can reach out to rectify the multiple haircuts i've had unsatisfactory results with."
wonderful group all around. tonee is my favorite but all of them are good. great place for highlights or just a haircut. good prices on their hair products too.
"this place is sometimes busy but if you make an appointment online which is super easy and convenient, you should be fine. everybody is friendly and welcoming, from staff to manager. i like berto , very popular, and mary, very down to earth. they will cut and converse with you which i like a lot cuz it makes the whole experience less awkward. don't hesitate to make conversation or certain requests related to your hair style. mary can be a little tough in terms of attitude but once you get to know her, she can be very funny. the hair cut is decent and the price is reasonable, i always pay $22 and $5 tips i usually add. my style is simple i guess , either military or short on the sides and medium on the top with a blend. i have never had an incident when i'm not happy with the outcome before. anyways try yourself and see!"
"tonee did her magic again, made me beautiful and five years younger! she is awesome and caring."
"i've been coming to this location for many years.  tonee does a fantastic job on my cut and style and i always walk out looking and feeling great!   ask for her when you come in, or better yet, call ahead or use their app.  the staff here is very friendly and professional, and they take great care of the shop as it's always immaculate.  the prices are very reasonable as well."
"came in with my daughter, mary helped us as she was combing her hair she is pulling her, saying her hair is tangle and dry. duh thats why we went to get her hair cut, she had attitudedefinitely wont come back. not recommended."
"super bad service  ,i came in girl with curly hair white glasses didn't  even welcome me ,but another girl came in she welcomed her,anyways she signed me in and i told her i want a haircut  and shampoo. i asked her right before she started cutting my hair,if she could do my eye brows  too ,she agreed. well she started cutting my hair  too fast and too rough, so i stopped her and i said please be gentle, than after she slowly changed her speed lol,for my luck,the supercuts  machine that she was using started pulling my hair and it hurts  when that happens, so i told her the machine  is pulling my hair, shes like, wonder y,get a new or ask supercuts for new one ,i noticed she wasn't happy with me so far ,anyways, than my sides were not equally the same so i told her to fix it and uneven so i told her to make it more even and better ,at this time she was not happy and i wasn't either but is not my fault  that she don't know how to cut hair ,or is it that difficult hair?she lacks customer service and detail, i just want a haircut .they charged $20 dollars and they do a crappy job and they expect customer to be satisfy and not say a thing, i don't think so,i will not go there anymore.she washed my hair and dry it and than i was expecting  my eyes brows  to be done and i asked her and shes like oh they turned  the machine off already and i said you probably don't want to do it .not a big deal  but it shows how they treat customers  there .i went to pay and told the guy ,tall ball headed ,she told me she would do my eyebrows  too but than she refused so unproffessoinal. i pulled out 5 dollars for tip but than i changed my mind ,no she didn't  deserved  a tip for the lack of customer  service  and detail and told the guy ,it was a nightmare getting this haircut and she should not cut hair ,she don't know how and how to treat customers. sunday july 8th afternoon closing at 5 pm, girl curly hair and white glasses . the tall guy apologizes.dont go there crappy haircuts .worst worst worst super badcuts."
"i have black chick curly hair and vicky handles it! she's not scared of the texture, understands the wave pattern and makes me feel pretty when i leave. the wash is great because of the water temperature (i know that sounds weird, but trust me), the technique and the vibrating chair! if that doesn't work, put your feet up. i love my cut and i'll be back for trims regularly instead of doing it myself and creating holes (bad girl). thank you vicky for working with your girl! :-)"
"i just got my hair cut at this location for the first time and it was great. i reserved my place online and they got me in as soon as i showed up. marco cut my hair, and although i was a little nervous at first because i've never had a man cut my hair, he was great. he really listened to what i wanted, was so sweet, and executed it beautifully. will definitely come back to him."
"i can't speak for all supercuts, but i've had two great experiences at this location, specifically with vickie. i learned that she's been with this location for 30 years! i had been looking around for an affordable, reliable place to get a haircut and was tired of spending nearly $100 at nearby salons so i gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. both times, i received wonderful customer service and left with a happy haircut. and as with any salon, what really matters is the hair stylist who's working on you, so i recommend giving vickie at this location a shot. the receptionist armando is also super friendly."
"my favorite salon in the world!! is super cuts . mayra and monique are like an artists they are talented and have wonderful personalities to match. for high  lights i trust mayra with my life! that lady knows what she is doing when it comes to hair. she is such an amazing person inside and out. it's truly a great experience with her all around. for hair cut - i just found my new favorite girl , maria . this was my first time working with her and she did a fantastic job with my hair cut . she  knew exactly what i wanted, i think she might read minds. cannot wait to get my hair done again."
"i'm so sick and tired of coming to supercuts and having every single person give me a reason why i shouldn't thin my hair out with thinning shears. i'm 23 years old. i've had this thick hair my whole life. i know for a fact that layers are never enough. i don't need anyone's opinion about how they think it should be cut. hairstylists always want to do what they want rather than what the customer is asking. if i ask for layers and my hair to be thinned out, i don't need your two-cents unless you are going to spend the money on the haircut and the aspirin i have to take every single day from the haircut. supercuts needs to teach their employees not to throw 2 cents in. i've had every single person say something along the lines of ""oh but there's people who wish they had thick hair like yours."" okay and?! i told you i want layers and for you to thin it out - it wasn't a question. anyway... the people are nice ‍ but i'm gonna be going elsewhere. $20 ain't shit. rather pay $60. i've tried about 10 different times at different locations. girl bye.so i went back in and the poor lady tried really hard to make me feel better about the haircut that i was given by a previous stylist. i went to the counter and still asked for my money back, when angie -who cut my hair in the first place- came and said ""well we fixed your hair and you said it's fine so we actually don't give money back"". so i said ""well it still looks like shit so i still want my money back"". angie was definitely very passive aggressive about it and i tried telling her what she did wrong, she became even more passive. i told her that her friend shouldn't have come up to her while she was cutting my hair and she then says ""they are a customer and i talk to all customers"". uh no you say ""i'll be right with you"" and you focus on the customer that you have at hand. she was definitely very passively aggressive. i told her that i've been in management for years and that i just didn't feel like it was professional, to which her reply was ""and i've been in it for 10 years and i'll still be here.""like oh alright then so you can't take constructive criticism? cool.i didn't get the name of the lady who helped fix my hair but she was so sweet. i kept crying and she was really patient."
i been coming here to have mayra cut my hair for a long time.. then my son hair... now my daughter and husband comes too!!! but we are so happy that even though mayra is our for few months.... we have angie to the rescue!!!!!! yes!!! she is amazing and very careful and caring.... just like mayra!!! update!!! i still love our two amazing lady's!! angie and mayra!! they are kind and know how to cut all kind of hair ... that's a plus for anyone to know!
"i had a very pleasant experience at this location. there is a large parking lot right outside so that takes the hassle out of getting a haircut in la! i called a few hours before to make a reservation and they were ready for me right when i walked in. the staff was smiley and the facility was kept in tip-top shape. unfortunately, i do not recall the name of my stylist but she did a fabulous job. i got a 1 on the sides with a fade and a scissor cut on the top. it looks great.  the price was rather typical at ~$19 and they do offer discounts for usc students. you never really know what you're going to get when you go to a supercuts, but i can definitely recommend the vermont location!"
some of the biggest mistakes of my life have been haircuts and it took me awhile to find a place to rid of this anxiety and this place is it. if ur new ask for mayra or wendy they dope ! they're good people.
it was super fast i don't like to be in a salon for a long time and luis was fast and did a good job on my hair and my baby's hair which was his first time. and the girls that did my daughters hair did good too. i will definitely go back with my kiddos.
"i got a good haircut for curly hair and a good price.  was very nice and patient.  then she immediately tried to sell me expensive hair products, and after i paid for the haircut she literally ran to the next customer as if i had evaporated.  i will probably go back, so i hope this gets read and they realize people already know what hair products they want, at least i do, did not like the sales pitch and quick dismissal after i paid.  i'm sorry i gave such a generous tip, she didn't even say thank you."
"long wait times, horrible customer service.   staff doesn't disclose how their system places you in back of the line if you show up a late after calling ahead to allow the customer decide if they want to wait or find somewhere else to go.  staff didn't even apologize.  i've been coming here for years but level of service has gone down.  they have high staff turnover here."
"angie is the reason i go to supercuts. she's incredibly nice and does a great job consulting before cutting/styling my hair. she's extremely talented with so many years of experience under her belt.:)p.s.she's extremely great with kid, especially with my 2 boys :)"
just got a haircut and color at this location . totally loved it! my hair feels so soft and i love the color. would totally recommend angie!
this has become my go to barber spot. sometimes the wait can be long. but they do let you call ahead to put your name in line so when you get there you won't be waiting forever. every time i've been there i've been happy with my haircut. thank you
"i give this super cuts 5 stars and if i had the option to give more i would.the young lady who cut my hair was absolutely phenomenal. i am the type to be very skeptical with trying new style hair cuts but boy!!!!!was candy right. you can tell sheobtains the passion in what she does. she took her time on me and after my hair cut i walked out of there feeling  bedazzled and not to mention ten  years younger.she had superior customer service.she was a great listener, very honest  and went beyond my version of what  was excepted. i am not from this area ,but will be definitely coming back to her.she is like the hair whisper!!!!"
"my family and i had been customers for two years, that is until two highly unprofessional employees made rude and unprofessional comments in spanish about our appearances. needless to say that supercuts has now lost loyal clients. way to go!!! i will make sure that corporate hears from me!!fantastic sams here we come!!"
very unprofessional. i called an hour ahead for appointment and they confirmed it. but when i visited they said they couldn't find my name on system and forgot to enter on system so if i still wanted haircut i need to make another appointment.
"i went right before they closed. alondra cut my hair. i wasn't very sure what i wanted so she was very helpful on figuring out, cut my hair well. she's very friendly and can hold a conversation. i was very happy with the service. she had amazing customer service. i recommend people to go here for a haircut."
love love this place! especially mayra! she's absolutely great! i can't stress this enough always satisfied with my cut!!
i had the most horrible experience today i called in at 11:53 was told there was a 25 minute wait got there within the window and now an hour later i am being cut. the receptionist wendy took to clients ahead me and when i spoke about calling ahead she was downright dismissive.  i have always come here but this might have been my last time. really disappointed
"while looking for a new barber, i decided to just get a quick clean up over here at this super cuts. wendy gave me a nice fade but i was too skeptical to have her line me up hahashe was very sweet and funny. her skills are pretty good and i would probably come back here if my new barber didn't have time for me. definitely a nice store on vermont."
so bad experience. they are not professionals. they are just barbers. the fat woman barber just pushed very hard by using electronic clipper and that really hurts and make my skin red and pain. totally bad experience. would never be there again!
"my son badly needed a haircut, especially in this heat. it was great service and his hair looks great. thank you!"
"guys (and i'm sure this applies to everyone as well), if you're looking for a great hair stylist who pays close attention to detail and ensures a quality haircut, please ask for vasilya. she always does a great job.  she is great to talk to and i can tell she takes pride in her work. i am lucky to have her as my hair stylist. again, ask for vasilya!"
"worst haircut ever. one stylist on duty, five customers waiting as i walked out. perhaps she was under pressure, i don't know. but i'll never visit another supercuts after today."
"i've had good luck here over the past couple of years, but that ended the other day when i was in and out of the chair in less than 10 minutes, with the worst haircut i've ever had.lady, don't ask me how i want my hair cut if you have no intention of doing it.there are some lovely and talented people here. lupe, for example.you're no lupe.adios super ripoff!"
"supercuts is one of my favorite places to do our hair..... specially with alicia, this time unfortunately she wasn't there, so , we didn't have more options.this 1 star is for the girl who made my husband's hair... very bad job!! i'm very sad and angry because she don't have customers service skills!... i was sitting waiting for my turn when this woman for doing the job, at the beginning i was ok, but, then i noticed that she was cutting little bit to much his hair, so i went to her station i told her: please that is fine don't cut more, i will little long there for cover his bold spot.... she kept cutting, i was angry, worried and i stepped in her station for second time and told her: please stop!, i told you don't cut more!... and she rise her voice at me telling me: mam, i'm the professional here and spoke with him.... wrong !!... if i'm talking to you at the beginning you should listen to the wife!... you are the professional, but i'm the wife!, i'm coming here for about 5 years, and i know how he likes and how i want!... now i have to listen his complaints for every single day! alicia is totally different!.. always trying to keep good relationships with couples!!note: how ever your name is, try to be nice specially with couples, one relays on the other, not in you!, that's why they go together, if not... he will go alone! i'll keep going, because alicia only... lesson learned... no alicia, no cut. so sad.sorry for my english:/"
"i never feel compelled to give bad yelp reviews because i have experience working in customer service jobs. i know how awful they are.i always tell myself it can't be that bad. the wait is always 45 minutes, even if you're tricked into thinking that calling before or checking in on the app actually does anything. there are always all these empty stations, and i don't think i've ever seen more than 4 stylists working at once. the result:the stylists end up giving slapdash haircuts. they prioritize those who look the most upset waiting for their turn.this is a simple supply and demand problem. while i was contemplating during my wait, at least 5 different walk-ins came in. they were told the wait was 90 minutes and left frustrated without a haircut. i am not sure why a business would want to turn away customers willing to spend money. hire more stylists for all these empty stations, and customers will not have to wait."
"nothing short of absolutely terrible. the haircut was not even passable. back of the head was shaved 3 inches above where the hairline is supposed to be. makes me wonder if this woman has ever done a men's cut before... got my money back for the haircut (still made me pay for the shampoo even though i was coerced into getting that) but it will be a month before my hair is even long enough for my gf to fix it.... just don't go here. by the reviews, the other supercuts in santa monica is way better. really regretting not going there."
"horrible!! i wanted a blowout so i came here!! there was a blonde girl in the middle of a hair cut, she greeted me and was very nice. then the stylist that was supposed to help me myra ( i think that was her name) called my name ( i think she butchered it) she seems to have an attitude. i sat in the chair and she walked away taking phones calls!! i understand you need to deal with phone calls but don't leave your client waiting!! tell them sorry and take the call!! just just left me in the chair!! she had attitude!! after waiting i just got up and left!! very rude and has no customer service!! she needs to fix her attitude!! also the salon was dirty!! there was hair and candy under the seats in the waiting area!! i will never return to this location!! i'd rather go to dry bar!! myra you need an attitude adjustment!!"
this is the best supercuts i've been to in santa monica. the employees here are all very nice and friendly and greet you when you come in. they take time with you and don't rush you out of the salon as i've seen in other places. they are great with both coloring hair/haircuts. i definitely recommend this salon!
"i have been this salon last weekend.  i did color,.high lights, cut and blow dry by melissa.  she did really great job on me.  i never satisfied my hair in korea town or be very hills, but this time yes.she knows what to do and very creative.  i went out next day with my friend, they asked me where i did my hair.  i told my friend about melissa.  she is the best.i'll go to melissa again even she is little too far from me.  also, i told my boyfriend to go to melissa.thank you melissa!!"
"a simple buzzcut for $30. came home & just noticed, un-even, i should have taken a closer look before leaving. it is what it is, i'll try not to come back."
i love rafaella she's so terrific she needs to be promoted i've only had her for coloring and she's great i'm so glad she was found for me i don't know what i would do without her so if you want someone to do your coloring she is the one to do it she knows her stuff a+ a+ a+
"check in online because it says there is no wait, when i arrive there is obviously a wait and the three women at the register are unwilling to give me an estimate of the wait time. i'm sorry but on a sunday i have more things to do than wait for an undetermined amount of time. a simple ""oh 5 minutes"" or ""it could be an hour"" is enough. i am not going to sit and wait for you to not give me an idea as to when i will be helped. update your online list because it is obvious that 10 people did not walk in in the 5 minutes it took me to drive in."
"the girl that cut, i mean butchered my hair was nice but my hair is a hot mess! i wanted an a-line bob but left looking like a lego piece. whatever! maybe i messed by coming to supercuts."
i get my haircut there at least twice a month and autumn does an amazing job every time. finally i have a hair stylist i can count on plus she's a sweetheart! thanks!!
i am not a very happy camper right now with this place i know i'm not very welcome back here again and i don't care i was taking out of this wonderful persons care for my hair regarding coloring which is unfortunate i highly recommend this woman to anyone and i will surely miss her rafaella she's the only one that i could recommend as outstanding stylist i wish her well in her career. and i thank her for all she did trying to help me out
alicia the manager gave me a great haircut! i finally have an even cut and my split ends are all gone.  she also fixed my fringe and it looks so much flattering now! definitely a thumbs up.
i got a pixie cut and i'm trying to let it grow out. lupe totally knew how to cut my hair and help me continue to grow it out. love her! i always go back for a bit of a touch up so it continues to grow out.
"i went in on thursday september 21st 2017 for a trim and the bleached blonde stylist (as i don't recall her name chopped a chunk of the front of my hair before i had a chance to stop her and have the manager intervene. i even showed the stylist a picture of me with my hair the way i wanted it cut prior to her commencing. i had a video shoot the next day and to top it all off the manager still wanted me to pay full price. i had to ask for a discount and she only discounted $2. i need to get in contact with the regional manager so that she can see what they did to my hair as it looks like a 3 year old cut it. i do not feel i should pay a dime for the cut, infact, i should be paid for potential loss of wages for work that required my long hair. please contact me as soon as possible to resolve."
"worst stylist ever. last night i went to get a fade, chick gave me an undercut. i knew i was gambling with supercuts, but i was just too lazy to go to active barbers down the street. so annoyed."
loved the vibe here! from the minute we walked in we were greeted and given an accurate wait estimate. raphaela is amazing! she did an amazing job giving my grandma a new hair style. her hair had grown out so long and unmanageable and raphaela was able to create exactly the look we had described. i really appreciated that this location was so accommodating in making room for my grandma's wheelchair (we have had bad experiences at other locations).  thanks again for everything! see you soon :)
"okay, so this is my go to spot for a haircut and rocky is my man here. i love this guy. he is warm, super nice, and a great person to chat with while getting your hair done. i typically start with a tea tree treatment and shampoo and then follow it up with a regular cut. rocky knows what he's doing after he consulted with my wife who gave him precise instructions on the cut that she likes on me. rocky has added some finesse to her suggestions and i really like the results. rocky recently had a rather serious accident which left him away from all the action for a good majority of last year. while supercuts made sure i was taken care of in his absence i was so happy and relieved to see him back. he's not just my stylist, he's more like a buddy. and he has now cut my hair, my wife's hair, and my mom-in-law's hair so yeah his style runs deep in our household. happy belated birthday buddy! and may you always keep smiling and bringing joy to people with your magical hair styling tricks. update: rocky is the saving grace of this place. any time he's not there service is awful!"
"second review.  shirley my last experience was ok but once again i find myself in a horrible situation. i called 45 minutes ago and put my name in. they gave me a wait time of 20 minutes.  so when i arrived i checked in just in case. at which point they could not find my name. so here i am nearly an hour from my call. which again i know waiting is a possibility but when you call in advance and don't have the confidence that your proper place was held, it's frustrating.  then the girl at the counter replies to me saying it's been 45 minutes.... ""yeah there are two people a head of you we have a lot of colors today.  want me to take your name off the list?""nope. i didn't ask you to. what horrible customer service. unfortunately this is the last time i will come to this place.  first review was 2 stars.  the staff here was not adequate. if you tell your customers 15 minutes you should at least accommodate someone with 10 min of that time frame. we understand having to wait an extra 10-15 minutes but they kept taking in other customers that they seem to know and said they checked in before hand. well then should that be incorporated in to the time frame provided to the customer. if you told me i would be waiting for over an hour i would have done something else and come back. it was just poor man"
"i've been coming here for the last two years and it never disappoints. rocky, one of the hair stylist has always been amazing! the staff is so helpful and accommodating. glad this location is part of the neighborhood. did i mention rocky is amazing!?"
"araselli is amazing,can't say enough nice things about her as a person and a professional , she did a fantastic job on my cut , it was exactly what i was looking for. will definitely be heading back to her the next time highly recommend making an appointment with her. thank you araselli"
"staff is friendly and does a good job. however, would only go as a last resort. last 3 times i have had to wait over 45 minutes after making an online appointment. if you do come, would highly suggest arriving late as this seems to be how they operate - worse than the doctors office!"
"the worst. mediocre haircuts at best, and the world's worst queing system.i checked in online (at 5:50) and was told that i should be up at 6:30. its now 50 minutes (and counting) after that and there are still two people ahead of me. i get that it's hard to make accurate predictions of wait time, but this is ridiculous. there are only two people working.i was told ""probably another 10 minutes"" about half an hour ago. i'm beginning to forget my life prior to coming here. i think i had a family, but i can't be sure.edit: i just mentioned that i've been waiting an additional 50 minutes and was told (no apology) that ""we can't predict the future"". another customer just said he'd come back tomorrow and was told ""it'll be like this tomorrow too"". get your sh*t together supercuts."
"have had fine experiences here in the past but today was quoted 1 hour for a haircut, waited 75 minutes, and then told there were two more people ahead of me... and there was only 1 person cutting hair in there! had to walk out because i was out of time to spare waiting. please quote accurate times or staff up!"
"the place is clean and modern, and busy. call in for an appointment or be prepared to wait. i thought this was supposed to be a discount barber shop chain, but the prices were actually a bit higher than the local ones.my barber, rocky, was very friendly but way too salesy. i'm not sure if that's his fault though as it sounded like every stylist had to offer at least 10 extra products/services during the course of a haircut. that's an aggressive upsell strategy but should realize how uncomfortable that makes some customers.he did do a good job with the little hair on my head. but i think i'll be going back to the mom and pops barbers that offer similar quality cuts without the sales pitches."
my hair turned out way shorter than i wanted it. i asked for shoulder length and i am now sitting here with chin length hair. i was in tears most of the day about it. she just kept cutting and cutting it's very choppy you can see the hard cuts in it and one side is longer than the other. i'm so disappointed. they said next time i came in they would set me up with a specialist but i won't be setting foot in a hair salon for an extremely long time. terrible experience. :(
god awful. avoid this location. they give you bad information on wait times and bad haircuts after waiting. many other better options in la.
"lost a customer of 5 years today.  i've had countless stylists over the course of being a customer at supercuts; some were/are great and some are mediocre.  the vast majority of the time, the mediocre ones try their best and put forth a great attitude and effort.  today i experienced the worst stylist at supercuts.  every adjustment i asked for she had a rebuttal and reason for why i was incorrect in my judgement.  i asked if she could make a slight change on a fade and she questioned my request because my hair grew a certain way and she was correct.  at no time was she apologetic for any of her actions or behavior.  when i asked to completely remove the fade she completed a half effort job and i had to come home and fix the issues myself.  when i asked to take an inch off the top she consistently questioned why i would do such a thing and how she knew what was best because she understood how my hair grew.  again another half effort there.  the fact is, a bad haircut grows back but making a customer feel uncomfortable and unsure during the entire time, this is how you lose a loyal customer and future referrals.  i apologize to all the great stylists at supercuts because surely they contributed to me coming back time after time.  unfortunately this person is the straw that broke the camels back."
jessica did a great job on my hair. i just moved to the area and was in need of a new spot to just do simple trims here and there. i highly recommend her.
"i have been going to the store in the marina for 3 years. i have my roots and high lights done there. sorry to say i will not being going to this particular  establishment.  i went to get my roots done (about a 2 hr process) . my hair is normally a light brown color with high lights. now my hair is so dark that all my high lights are gone and what is left is like tan high light. (this took 4 hours. )the stylist was a little rough, he used a comb with a sharp end on it to part my hair, he was very hard on the back of the neck. i made a grimace face and said ouch. he said oh sorry dear i will be easy. as he proceeds to the side of my head he swipes inside the ear on both sides. i have so much more to say, but it feels like i'm reliving this nightmare."
"sloppy. no attention to detail on my 6 year old boys hair. i will need to re-trim around his ears and back of his neck. she didn't engage or acknowledge my son one bit!  the only interaction she had with him was to push his head down to crookedly trim the back of his neck.  not to mention she had absolutely no personality. probably said about 7 words to me and my son, total. at the end she handed me the ticket / bill and said here give this to the receptionist and tell her that her scribble said $22. not even a thanks for coming in, have a nice day or bye. ..nothing! then i noticed her apparent, regular came in, a nice senior lady, boom everything changed....she was all smiles and chatty....  night and day!   lame."
"if you're looking for a high-end beverly hills level cut without breaking the bank, you've got to come see rocky. when it comes to getting haircuts i used to dread trusting my looks to someone else so i'd always pay for premium haircuts. a friend of mine told me about rocky at supercuts in the marina and i just had to check him out for myself and boy was i impressed. he not only totally gets me, but we always have a blast brainstorming about cool new things to try. it's a treat to have him bring out your best and you'll have a hell of a fun time chatting with him in the process! this is what the 5-star rating was designed for."
"thank you to rocky for yet again another stellar job on my son's hair!  he is knowledgeable, talented with the clippers and scissors, and very experienced.  rocky is personable, friendly, and good with both kids and adults. my son is so happy with his haircut and says rocky is so nice.  it is very busy here every time we come, so make an appointment to cut down on waiting time."
visiting and had time to get a much needed haircut. went in on a whim and left super happy with the haircut cassandra gave me.she took the time to carefully discuss what i wanted and never rushed into styling. i really liked the outcome and it is exactly what i wanted. thank you so much.
"i'm not giving them 1 star because they truly tried to please me but i already had a real sour taste in my mouth. when i walked in, there were only 2 ladies sitting in the waiting area. they happened to both be waiting for this little girl getting a cut. as time went on, people would walk in and they'd ask if they were so and so and almost immediately take them to a chair that was freeing up. i watched 5 or 6 people come in after me but get taken to a chair ahead of me. confusing for a place who doesn't accept appointments. apparently you can call and ""check in"" an hour ahead....so i sat there for 45 mins before i got real irritated about what was happening. the manager handed me $4 worth of coupons and the guy who cut my hair offered a free wash with my cut. i had worked an 11 hour day and just wanted to get home so i declined the wash. the guy really did work hard to get me out of the mood i was put in. the next problem was when he handed me the little mirror to see the back. i pointed out how my right side was lower down my neck. he tried to fix it my starting in the middle and going to my left side...the side that was already higher. i really didn't want to create an even bigger scene so i just paid(they gave me $3 off) and i left. when i got home, my fiance expressed that maybe i should stop getting $20 haircuts because it definitely shows. i had her fix my neck line as well as get some random hairs that were missed. i'm a guy so i care much less about a bad cut because it'll grow back but man, it definitely is going to affect my decision to return."
"this place is awesome, basically i never had to wait more then 15min. to get a haircut. very friendly.never been disappointed with my haircut."
"i love my haircut! the hairdressers were very professional, and cut my hair exactly as i wanted. only problem was that i had to wait an hour and a half. but they were busy and i didn't call ahead."
"hi , i hardly give reviews but i had to for gina brown in the westwood shop , i used to go to a private barber but decided to try supercuts in westwood and met gina and i been using her for over 5 years , she knows exactly how i like my hair cut and because i have greyish hair and i hate it she does the perfect brown color on me every time , i will not use anybody but her , i think she is amazing and will continue to use her for as long as am around , see u in 3 weeks thank u gina ps: i dont understand why the bad reviews , she is always sweet and i think its unfair on what i saw written ,"
"i'm usually not satisfied with my haircuts and styling. so i don't often go get my hair done. but, i'm really glad i came to this supercuts. i got a fantastic haircut and am very satisfied. wait wasn't very long, but i checked in online. so that might have saved me some time. service was fantastic and the lady cutting my hair had a strong attention to detail. i didn't catch her name, but she had a tattoo on her chest. thank you supercuts for a wonderful haircut and you'll be seeing me again."
absolutely worse experience and trash haircut i've ever received. i literally walked out mid cut. the lady (gina) who just cut my hair literally took about 10 minutes and was done. no edging or anything to clean up the little areas. she also went much higher after i told her twice not to go too high on my sideburns and actually pointed at where i wanted them. she said they were both the same length which clearly they aren't. had to go to a barber nearby and chose supercuts as only option because i'm away from my usual barber. attached are photos. i never leave reviews but this was crazy!
"the staff is friendly and facilities clean. however at the end of the day the review should be about the haircut- that is where supercuts in my experience always falls short. go in for a basic crew cut and they can't get it right ( hair sticks up in the back and is uneven on the sides of the head).as a national chain they have a lot of employees who only cut hair for a few years then move on- not the same steady hand or experience as a barber who's been doing it for a decade...yes they can cut your hair, but so can your 8 year old niece with kiddie scissors, you want a quality cut go to a barber"
"we walked in with my 4 year old son.  hoping for a little touch up around the ear and neck.  the young african american young lady we had, i think was working with out a license or cheated her way through beauty school.  she had no clue how to use the electrical scissors and make a straight line.  my son's left and right side burns don't match at all.  we told her nothing from the top and she cut the front of his hair so much and so uneven, he looks bald.  i'm literally in tears.  if it wasn't for my husband, i would go in the store screaming.  shame on you in that store"
"the worsti took by 3 year old son there today, and i have never ever seen such pathetic service.lousyi feel bad for my son, i could have closed my eyes and done better.there are empty spaces and long and out shape.shame on you guys for hiring no experience person.last time for me"
"i am so fortunate that i walked out instead of letting gina cut my hair. consistent with other reviews, she immediately demanded to know what clipper guard to use and seemed shocked that i didn't want the clippers. when i started to explain how i wanted my hair cut, gina cut me off demanding to know how much to cut off. i told her that i wanted the length of the front of my hair to be 3 inches, and she said, ""i don't know what that means.""when somebody's rude, doesn't listen, and doesn't know what ""3 inch length in the front"" means, it's time to walk out. so i smiled and walked out while she glared at me. then i came on yelp and saw that gina has racked up 7 1-star reviews with consistent comments about how she doesn't listen and cuts poorly. i went to the supercuts on pico & sepulveda instead and got a fine haircut from ydera."
"this place absolutely butchered my hair.i've been going to supercuts for years in other cities. this was by far the worst haircut i've ever had. it was so bad, i refuse to go to a walk-in place from here on out. only salons for me. my experience: i walked in, and there was one lady sitting on the couch in the waiting area. one person ahead of me is typically not bad. i check in, and turns out the lady sitting on the couch was the stylist. she walked to a station with me, and had no clue what she was doing. she was scrambling to find razors and scissors. she even selected things out of the ""soiled"" drawer. it was evident she had never even cut hair before. unfortunately she already started the cut on me...without asking, she cut my sideburns completed off and turned them into a straight line from the top of my ear.... how is this even possible. i quickly realized this girl had never even been through proper training before. there were a number of other things, such as randomly blow drying me when she didn't need to, not offering a shampoo, not asking if i wanted the back square or round, and not knowing how to do a fade without leaving multiple lines. it is absolutely incredible someone like this was even allowed to cut hair. i am honestly considering shaving my head. my sideburns just look silly right now, and people have already told me so. no more chances for me. i'm paying for a salon from here on out.do not go to this location"
"my first time at this supercuts location. i stopped going because i had a lot of bad experiences with supercuts in the past so i was skeptical of giving them one more chance.. i came into the westwood location, was greeted kindly and waited a few minutes. this sweet lady gina gave me a haircut and it was amazing!!  it did not take long, and she fully understood what i was looking for!! i am very happy with my cut! i will def be back!! thanks gina!!"
this was the worst haircut ever. stay away!!!!  i did not see the reviews before but i wish i had. now i am stuck with a terrible cut. you cannot trust supercut chains anymore.
natasha is simply the best. i first met her at the pico location. i'm super picky about dying my mostly grey hair and each time she's done a fabulous job working with me to pick the color and then applying it beautifully. the color does not fade and the only downside is because my hair remains so healthy it grows out super fast
"thank you so much veronica, i was so scared to try supercuts but you gave me a wonderful hair cut, couldn't be happier. my spoiled beverly hills tushy will go to supercuts from now on. thank you v"
"the only place in la what was not completely booked. korian (koco) did a great job of making me feel comfortable and really trying to understand what i wanted in my haircut. my hair was already a bit short with a blunt cut at the end. she explained what she was doing, before cutting my hair, which i absolutely adored. no hairstylist had ever told me that i could get my hair layered and not cut off a couple inches off the ends! there's plenty of parking in the back, which i recommend. my haircut was around $20-25. if you are going here, call and book koco!!!"
"i had a great experience here, apart from the palpable hesitation when i told my stylist how short i wanted my hair. the service staff was friendly and helpful. and even though she kind of tried to talk me out of my idea, she was still very attentive to my desires and it worked out in the end. not sure why these reviews are low-- it's supercut, not a private salon. good experience though, i will probabaly be coming back"
"in this review, i refer to the supercuts on 1650 westwood blvd. los angeles, ca 90024 with the phone number 310-470-1558.awful, awful service at this store falsely calling itself supercuts.  i called the headquarters, and they said this location is not under the supercuts umbrella.  don't be fooled!both the stylist and the cashier had a nasty attitude, treating me with contempt and disrespect, and as if they were doing me a favor.  after this horrendous introduction, i received a sloppy haircut, and now my hair is unkempt.  i mentioned this experience to one of my friends, and she promptly told me that she had also received a bad haircut at this location.  i will never set foot into this store again; it is one of the worst experiences i have ever had.  1 star is far too generous."
"firstly i worked for supercuts for 25 years as a manager and educator , my daughter lives in westwood and needed her haircut , since i live in another city with  no equipment with me , i called ahead for a wash, cut and blow dry , it was clear the stylist did not want to do any blow drying today since she quoted me 35 additional dollars for a total of 61 dollars for my daughters shoulder length layers . 21 for the cut , 5 for the shampoo , and 35 for a simple blow dry ?, right...pure laziness . all those years i served my clients fairly with a smile and without complaint and to get this, truly infuriated me . so we walk out with wet hair when all we wanted was a simple blow dry not a extravagant updo , because there's no way i'm going to have someone with a bad work ethic rip me off ."
"i will not return to this location nor have gina a short mexican woman touch my head again. she did not listen to the instructions given to her, had to be told to cut around the ears, but did not trim the eye brows, plus did not comb my hair. charged me $21.00 then had the nerve to ask for a tip. i believe this woman belittled me with her colleagues  behind my back after i left the location. i recommend not to attend this location unless you have a established hair coiffure."
worst experience i have ever had at a supercuts with staff and professionalism and cut!!! i will never take my boys there again. both stylist were complaining about my boys hair to me . although one did a decent job cutting my son's hair gina was complaining about me in front of me in spanish to the other stylist not knowing that i understood every word! she didn't want to cut my son's hair and tried her best to mess it up! and at the end when i tipped both stylist although i was not happy with my experience and hair cut the lady who rang me up complaint about the 15% tip i left each!
"waited for 2 hours even though they said the wait was only 15 mins. shame on you! when it finally came time for the haircut, it was shockingly mediocre, yet not at all cheap. terrible place. would not recommend at all."
"first, get more than 3 dang parking spaces. second, lovely customer service from 3 younger short ladies. smiles and said hello when i walked in. it's all downhill from there folks, some lady who honestly was probably drunk, came straight to me for a haircut, skipping the little 16 year old who had been there before i (i came to find out). then she cut my hair trying to be as fast as lightning. i'm guessing she was off at 4:30 or something. she then scraped the back of my neck with the same buzzer she cut my hair with. i'm pretty sure you have trimmer you could've used. as my neck sits here and burns from the crappy cut i received. also, the line up is crooked anyway. rrrrghh, why did i leave a tip.."
"i loved this place. i didn't make an appointment, i just walked in, and i didn't wait very long (i got lucky). blanca trimmed my hair. i was so desperate for a cut. she fixed my hair right up! i love how much volume it has now. thank you so much! i will definitely return for my next cut! highly recommend this location!"
"good luck to anyone trying to get good service here! worst customer service i have experienced in a long time... and to top it off it's happened a few times (should've written this review a while ago, but have tried to give them the benefit of the doubt). good luck trying to call ahead and get an accurate account of how long it will take. sadly a few of the stylist do a great job of cutting mens hair but the device in trying to get to a chair is horrible!! tonight i tried to walk in and was happy to see at least two stylist i am familiar with... was told i could write my name down and it would be 45 min. so i go run errands and come back to have to wait again. *also one time a lady was either so incompetent or rude that she tried to give me a mo-hawk and when i tried to get her to fix it, she handed the machine and scissors to another stylist. they couldn't even really look me in the eye as i asked how long it would take. hate to be impatient but this has happened before when i need to catch a flight out of town and this was the last straw... my kids hadn't eaten dinner and although i really needed a haircut, i can't stand when people can't be curtiss enough to keep an ""appointment""."
"i called to make an appointment for my son. i was informed that they do not take appointments, just walk-ins. so i just took my son in after school... there's an hour wait. then she asks, ""do you want me to put you down for that time?""what?? ""i thought you don't take appointments,"" i said. ""well, we take call aheads,"" she said. ""and why didn't they tell me that when i called to try scheduling an appointment?"" i asked. ""i don't know.""ugh."
"horrible service celia is a horrible rude stylist if you can call her that , she has no manner she is rude to her customers especially if young , my son went in to get a cut he asked for a 2 then decided for a one she right away said w an attitude an intimidating tone "" you asked for a 2 "" sideburns?????long or short ? he was like huh , she said these long or short w an intimidating tone  as well , i complained to clerk and she said yeah she is rude ..... i say management get her out if you don't want health dept there as well due to unsanitary issues that were noted $18 dollars down the trash and a 13 yr old who said yes she was rude but what could i do ... she's an adult? because mind you i have taught my child to respect his elders but this lady should be let go please contact me for more info management ilozano1616@icloud.com"
"i moved out to downtown la a few years now and it's hard finding a great hair stylist. i decided to give supercuts in downey a try because of the rave reviews. i went in yesterday morning and i'm glad i did! i happen to get my hair cut by the stylist blanca (whom i read the great reviews about prior before). not only is she great.. she's fast, very friendly, and i absolutely love the style of cut she gave me!!! :dnot only am i excited for my new cut.. i appreciate the friendly staff, the reasonable price and how well organize they are with their valued customers..thank you blanca!!! you're awesome! definitely will be seeing me again for a next cut :)continue.. i came by tuesday, but blanca wasn't there! i took a risk in having joanna cut my hair.. and i'm glad a did! love my cute asymmetrical short bob! not only did you bring bounce to my hair, but i no longer feel self conscious in leaving my hair down. thank you joanna.. you're awesome!!!!"
"parking is a major issue with this location, and not making appointments.  you can call 45 minutes before to be put on the list.  i always like the cut.  usually we have the same stylist. they take mastercard and visa, but not american express."
"i will never go back to this place!!! i have never been humiliated in my life like i did !!!! i went yesterday because my 6 year old daughter needed a trim and i took my baby with me because i had called ahead of time and they told me they would have a stylist available as soon as i came in. while my daughter was getting her hair cut, my little one was walking around and i was supervising and making sure she didn't touch or get anything. the stylist joanna so rude told me to make sure the baby didn't touch the product, and really got upset because i was already watching her and shes just a baby. i felt shamed-mom, she yelled it out in front of everyone that was there. then another stylist opens the door knowing that i had my 1 year old and i asked her if we can close the door because didn't want her to run outside and get hit by a car. she told me she didn't care and that i should hold her. basically told me to tie her down like a animal. never again come back again!!!! i will be also contacting corporate office. what i don't understand why i was treat so poorly and still want my money !!!!  honestly i would want a refund!!"
"stylist are always a hit and miss and to top it off you always get someone new, for some reason they can hang on to employees here. the wait and the customer service are the worse!even if you call in ahead you are bound to wait at least 40min after your estimated wait time. i always try to give places a second,third chance and this specific time lace has always been bad! so i would suggest you try some where else to  have a better experience."
"update: called back the next morning and the manager blanca offered to fix my hair. i hurried over before leaving town and she repaired the mess that was done to my hair. because of the other lady, it was straight on the right side, slanted in the back and two different lengths on the left. she mentioned the lady that cut my hair said i wanted a slanted cut. well, her employee *lied* to her cause i specifically told her i wanted a simple straight bob. even if i did want a slanted cut, in what world does that mean straight and slanted in 4 different lengths?! anyway, the manager was friendly and gave me the perfect cut even though she had to trim it shorter than i initially wanted it, but it was necessary to fix it. couldn't be mad at her, not her fault another employee rushed through my hair and didn't care enough to make sure it was even. while i'm glad she fixed it, i still won't be returning. which is a shame cause i used to get my hair done here all the time years ago when i worked nearby.added one star since the manager made things right. had some issues reserving my appointment time on the website. kept getting an error so i just walked in. they said my time did go through and i was next. i wanted my bob trimmed & re-shaved in the back. i believe it was the supervisor on duty that cut my hair. she asked if i wanted shampoo and condition, i said yes so the shaved bits would be shampooed away from my hair. she sprayed down my hair then cut it at the right length i wanted. she showed me the back to make sure it was short enough. during the shampoo she asked if i would like a blowdry & style, i said yes but she said she didn't have time cause she wanted to take another customer to do a hair cut on him. what?! why? i was there first. asked me to wait 20 min so she could cut his hair then finish mine! i didn't want to sit around w/ wet hair so i declined. came home to dry it myself and noticed the cut is so uneven! one part is almost an inch longer than the rest. see the photo. worst hair salon experience ever!incomplete hair cut and unprofessional attitude! i only came here cause my usual stylist was busy the next few weeks. never again! now i'm going to have to try and even out the cut myself, and it's already short eno"
very disappointed i do not recommend this place. i came here looking to get a blunt over the shoulder haircut and i ended up with a mushroom bob. not only is it not what i asked for but it's also very uneven. now i have to wait until my hair grows out to recut it. i believe the lady that cut it was named ana but i have to double check. my hair is curly and i didn't notice how uneven it was until i got home to straighten it. now i'm stuck with a mushroom head. i rated 2 stars because she was friendly and minimal wait time but the cut she gave me is really bad. if you must go to this location i would suggest a different stylist for this type of cut. i am adding pics for reference.
"i love this spot! i keep my hair super short with a tight fade and let me just say blanca can get that done in a quarter of the time it use to take my barber to do it. i always check in on-line cause it's easier to reserve your spot. with the reservation i may wait no more than 5 minuets once i arrive. keep in mind, this place is always busy, which speaks volumes at how good these girls are. in addition to the good service, it's always a good time chatting with these girls. they are all super cool and funny but most importantly efficient. i've now turned several friends (male & female) on to this spot. so far we've all been good. thanks again ladies and see you in a week!"
"i have been a customer for this location for years. they have great staff, clean salon, great customer service. i started using the online reservation which saves me time because they are a very busy store. defiantly try their tea tree experience. highly recommended. a++"
this is a great place to get your hair cut.  the service and people are very nice.  blanca is awesome!
"i love their service, i came in and blanca huke me up.. i came out looking very pretty. thank you so much. she's the best. come to super cuts you wont regret it. money worth spend! thank u"
"extremely rude, uneducated so called stylist. joanna rodriguez has the worst attitude. she acts like she is doing you a favor by cutting you hair. someone should really pay more attention on how customers get treated at this super cuts location. i did not even get the haircut i wanted because of how uncomfortable she made me feel. i just wanted her to get her hands off my hair already. i strongly suggest you to go to the one on lakewood."
"these girls are amazing! each & everyone of them. they are dedicated to their customers and service. super helpful. they listen to the customers needs. i have to admit my first initial visit was rough but for some reason these girls are awesome and aren't the same. totally personable. yes the wait is long, but that's expected. why rush especially on a hair cut? please don't rush on me. i will be back :)"
"i used to go here a little, but that's until the last woman who cut my hair about 8mos ago, left a huge long piece of hair without cutting it. i didn't even notice til i got out the shower and combed my hair out. how the heck can you possibly miss that? never going back. plus, they take forever, and that's probably because they are too busy talking and not cutting hair. no thanks."
"let me preface this by saying that i have been getting my hair professionally highlighted and colored since i was a preteen and am now 29.  also, please note the pictures i have included. i wish i could include the sinking feeling i have walking in public but my lengthy review will have to do. i am naturally blonde but have enjoyed keeping my hair super light with some slightly darker (medium brown) undertones... or as i was informed by one of the stylists are ""low lights."" well, i showed them 4 pictures of extremely blonde hair as the reference for how light i wanted my hair and one photo with the blonde & slightly contrasted shades alongside the blonde. long story short, my hair turned out way darker than when i walked in. it is currently a light brown from the light blonde that i was. i was charged $220+tip for a bunch of stuff i didn't agree to (deep treatments and 2 other things that were never explained to me). i was so upset that i couldn't formulate my questions right and every single girl who worked there made me feel worse by saying that it was my fault for getting low lights, that that is the reason my hair is now brown. no one had a consultation with me. no one showed me a sample of what colors they would be using. no one told me prices and when i asked, the response was ""we'll have to see..."" they made me feel so bad for coming in at 3:45p on a saturday, too.   (i left at about 7:15) i felt unbelievably uncomfortable because they made t known that they were so busy and that their manager who scheduled my appointment messed up by saying okay to me. two girls worked on my hair but neither of them told me what they were going to do. then every single girl was rude, defensive, and accusatory towards me about how dark my hair turned out. i feel so gross about how my hair looks (even though they kept saying ""it's beautiful! it's beautiful"")... i can't come back to have it ""fixed"" because i will be undergoing a surgery and out of commission for 3 weeks (which is after the amount of time that they will fix it)... and they won't refund me for the insane amount of ""extras"" that they added to my bill without my knowledge. i wouldn't have agreed to paying it in the beginning if i wasn't told that the manager could probably refund a portion of the bill and if it wasn't past closing when i left (i was so disappointed and shooken up that i couldn't even argue the price with them.). just be extreeeemely careful if you have naturally light hair and want highlights.  i can't get over how poorly these people treated me. from beginning to end i felt uncomfortable then disappointed and now like someone stole from me. i usually spend my money on high end salons like luigi bruni in michigan and charles ifergan salon in chicago but this is my mistake for trusting a low grade hair place like supercuts.  and when i mentioned what my cousin (miriah from charles ifergan salon) said about this places process, the rude manager, blanca, shut me down and said that everyone does hair differently so her opinion doesn't matter. well, hers does considering she's a upstanding colorist that makes supercuts look like the lowest grade hair establishment. don't go here.if they make a mistake you will have to pay... quite literally... and you will pay the price of an actual upscale salon that makes you feel good about yourself... now embarrassed."
got my hair cut and colored and blanca did an awesome job and color came out perfect!!  the store is clean and all the staff is very friendly totally recommend!
every time i walk out of this store my hair is healthy and beautiful. blanca's been doing my hair the last couples times and she's a great. amazing colorist! very nice and professional :)
"i didn't have time to go to my person for a haircut so i went to supercuts by my work.  ana cut my hair and she did a great job!  the only downside is that they are very busy and only two stylist were there and they have to stop what they are doing to either answer a call or speak to a walk-in.  supercuts, you need an receptionist for your stylist but overall, ana is the person to go to for a great haircut.  gina jackson"
"i walked in yesterday 15 minutes before closing and i was told that i was going to be serviced. the 2 stylist finished with their customers at the same time. neither one wanted to approach me or acknowledge me. i stood up and walked towards them. i said i'll just come back tomorrow since you're closing. neither one said sorry or thank you. i've been there before business hours and let's just say that they've opened late before. if you're gonna open your business late, do you think it's a good idea not wanting to provide services to late walk ins. the only bad outcome for me leaving this location is that i won't be helped by ana. ana gives the best haircuts. shame!"
"just got the worst hair cut off my life. they forgot to fade half the side of my head, so it looks like i'm wearing a hat. had to pay $50 so someone can come to my house at 9pm to fix this, because i can't got into the office like this. likely going to appeal on credit card, this is ridiculous."
1st time having my twins get their hair cut @ a super cuts because it's difficult apparently to just trim ends when their hair is down to their waist ... but not for ana ... she did an amazing job and didn't rush . she was very pleasant and my twinkies loved her as well . we will definitely be back because of her great customer service and professionalism .  thanks for the great experience ana !
"yea it's nice with the app and all, but if i'm going to pay almost $30 for a haircut i'd expect them to at least have a 7"""
"went in today with my boyfriend, he got his haircut by philip. when asked to cut the top a little shorter, he immediately corrected my boyfriend. he was very rude, normally the staff is very welcoming and super nice. avoid philip at all costs."
"the young lady with short hair who cut my hair was very nice and outgoing but the she did a terrible job cutting my hair. 7 people now have made fun of my haircut, heck even my 10 year old son made fun of my crappy haircut. the cut is so bad that i considered buzzing my hair. i will never cut my hair at supercuts and i'm disappointed that a place this ""reputable"" has such crappy ""hair stylists"""
ok so i've had some bad experiences at this location (ridiculous wait times due to under staffing) but today was literally the last draw. called at 10:30 and made an appointment for 11:30 and i arrive 5 minutes before the appointment time. at 11:50 they call my name but i'm wrapping up a work call so i tell them i need 1-2 minutes but i'll be right in and i'm told sorry they have to move onto the next person (a walk in who had been waiting less than 10 minutes). so apparently it's ok to keep a customer waiting for 20 minutes but the stylists waiting 1-2 minutes is too much of an inconvenience. i will never come back to this location....
five stars for phillip who not only gave me one of the best haircuts i've had in a long time but also gave me some great tips for making my thin limp hair appear fuller. i even bought a product at his recommendation (a root lifter) which i never do and so far i love it!
"don't understand the concept of appointments... i called m made an appointment in advance and was given one for 3:20pm, get there at 3:10. my stylist was still finishing up with someone so i waited. he then calls the person who walked in after me. so i asked them if it was gonna be a while, i was told i had to check-in once i got to the salon, so i checked in and was told i'll be next. but a guy who just walked in with no appointment was attended to at 4:15 , while i have been waiting for almost an hour. trust me as a small business owner i'm the last person to leave a feedback like this, but i don't appreciate a business who don't value their customers time. i won't be coming back here again nor would i recommend anyone to go there...."
"elle (or el) probably is the worst stylist i've ever met. she seemed like she just had drugs or something, very frustrated by the hair on the ground, she kept complaining and using a blowdryer to blow the hair away. she's impatient, unfriendly, and of course my hairstyle is ruined with an uneven edge. i'll never visit this store again."
"5 stars to alfredo - 3 stars this locationnot to knock the other stylists but alfredo has been the only one who consistently give me a cut as i expected.  i may be bias but i feel my request is closer to the simple spectrum, i've had other stylists shave off my sideburns leaving an awkward gap between my head and beard.  he pays attention to detail and something he does that i never expect out of anyone is he remembers who you are and details about you and your life.the store i give a lower score to because not only do they charge a higher rate the my older supercuts but they also tack on a $2 ""request"" fee.  honestly no one would be requesting if everyone delivered.to be fair the 3 people that had given me a bad cut haven't been at this location for quiet some time but i'm in no hurry to replace alfredo."
"had to get my whole head shaved at the end of the cut because some woman who works there doesn't understand a crop goes down, not up like a pseudo-mohawk a 7th grader would have. it was just completely unacceptable, and the woman was beyond rude, rolled her eyes countless times and was completely careless. i will literally never go to another supercuts again. just shell out the extra $20 to go to floyd's or better yet support your local shop, your hair is worth it. i could have done a better job on my own using a lawnmower."
"five stars just for yoko alone! i wasn't blown away by my first cut here months ago, but tonight i had the luck to get yoko for the first time. she was absolutely meticulous and very skilled on my long unruly hair.at supercuts, the basic haircut (priced here at $21.95; locations vary) usually do not come with a wash unless you pay for it (the wash-plus-cut package here is $25.95), so they usually only wet your hair with a spray bottle before cutting. yoko saw my mane condition, and instead of just spraying my hair down, she took me to the back sink area to fully wet my hair as well as apply conditioner and later detangler so that she could get a better cut.be warned that this supercuts location is very busy, and their online ""check-in"" (which holds your spot in line remotely) wasn't working tonight, so i called in and was told it was a 40 minute wait. it ended up being more like a 60 minute wait, but i stopped in and then came back again. the good thing is that the clientele here is almost all male so their cuts go pretty quick with the two stylists yoko and monica here, even when there are three people in front of you.special requests for a stylist cost an extra $2, but may be worth it for yoko. monica is also pretty good, but yoko goes the extra mile!tip: right now there is a $2 coupon online for one-time use when you sign up for the supercuts emails for this location."
"they made us wait for an hour and a 1/2 but told us 45 minutes wait. didn't apologize. my son had long hair and wanted to cut his pony tail. he went from long hair to short hair but hairdresser wouldn't allow us to photograph it even though i promised hair dresser wouldn't be in frame. such bad attitude. then she butchered his hair and it had uneven lines. i should have known she was terrible from the cheap dye that covered her middle age grays ,epic fail trying to look like a millennial."
"don't go here, you'll be ripped off. bad customer service and even worst hair cut service. overpriced and unhappy workers. the front desk lady needs an attitude check. going back to the barber shop because this place is garbage."
"thanks to sarah for my shampoo, haircut & blow dry. another thanks to ceci for recommending me. they both made me feel comfortable, inviting & very relaxed. i was unsure if i wanted to show up due to losing a lot of hair after my 2nd pregnancy but they reassured me that i had nothing to worry about. nor did i need to feel embarrassed. as one of their first time clients they couldn't have treated me any better. thank you girls! until next time."
i have to write a review after phillip literally made a whole in my son forehead . my son ask for a faded haircut . his hairline is back about 1 inch . my 10 years old was so upset . can't be fixed so at least i got my money back . will never go to a supercut salon
the wait was short considering i walked in around 5:30 pm and elle was fantastic. i haven't gotten a haircut in about two years so naturally i was nervous but she did a wonderful job. i would definitely return.
"this location is always understaffed, leading to long wait times. stylists are qualified but whomever sets the schedules is obviously oblivious to the fact that customers are not being served ina reasonable amount of time. one should not have to wait an hour to get a haircut at a supercuts."
"honestly, i usually always go to the bigger salons. but it was a sunday and i needed a ""trim""(like 5 inches kinda cut). they were fast, professional and good. i'll come again for my trim. happy they're around."
"three attempts here before i'm moving on. stylists, on the whole, seem outwardly pleasant and helpful, but the atmosphere is not managed. by the nature of the business, walk-in clientele are on parity with those taking the opportunity to""check-in"" prior to arrival, meaning if you have a time given you when calling or online, treat it as a nice gesture. thee is no such obligation to honor it here. want an appointment so as to work around your life, go elsewhere. fair enough. want to attempt to manage time here, forget it. there is no real incentive for checking in when others can come in off the street ahead of you based upon a complex algorithm only the reception staff know. i want to like this place. however, if waiting 45 minutes on average is a problem for you, then move to a place with an appointment system and develop a relationship with a stylist that is harmonious with your needs."
"jose, the manager, is amazing! i wanted my hair shaved, but still feminine looking. i had a photo with me, and he completely ""nailed"" it! this is a cut i was just about to pay $85 for at my regular salon, but i took a chance while waiting for my husband to get his haircut.i couldn't be happier with the results. in addition, jose and i had such a good time while he ""nailed"" each section. the most impressive part is that he walked me through what he would do before approaching each sectioni'll be back!!!!!"
they open at 8:00am and are conveniently located downtown. very few places are open this early. this is a great way to get a cut before work.
thanks to kim for the wonderful layers for my thick wavy curls. days later i'm in love with my haircut.   appreciate your expertise. applause!
"my new dtla spot for haircuts. priced well, service is awesome, jose is rad and always take the time to listen and understand what im looking for. quick, clean and relaxed atmosphere. im always a walk-in but they seem to find room for me in a timely fashion."
kim does a great job every time i come here. two thumbs up for service and two thumbs way up for listening.
"great atmosphere etc but what you really care about is the cut.  jose is great, listens to what you want and walks you through his plan to get there.  does a great job.  i'm very happy this place is around the corner from me but if it wasn't i would take a drive downtown to still come here."
"i am a student and needed to keep my costs down so when i arrived i asked how much it would be for a haircut and they told me $26. the stylist took me to my seat and asked if i would like my hair blowdried telling me i would be charged $30 and if i wanted my hair shampoo'd to she would charge me $6. i expected the total to come to $36 but received a bill for $62. i was surprised and asked how it jumped so high and they became defensive, telling me i was told of the prices. i do not feel they were very clear.  i would never in a million years expect to pay more for a blow-dry than the haircut.  they should have been clear and when i asked about it, i didn't appreciate their defensiveness. i called corporate and the owner was supposed to call me but never bothered. i would have been a returning customer if this hadn't happened but not now."
"so my barber of 3 years up and quit without telling me so i was left without a stylist. searched yelp for locations in downtown, surprisingly supercuts had the best reviews by far. took a chance and had allison cut my hair, wow i was impressed! she did an amazing job! definitely returning, the cut, the fade and the blending she did on my simple 1940s combover is impeccable!"
"price is a little higher then where i'm from but understandable for being dtla. jose did my hair and did an amazing job, great to talk with. very fast service with online check in"
"i came in for a small haircut and a trim on my bangs. erika wtf is this. seriously dude she just went ham on my bangs for $26. prices went up by the way, it's no longer $23"
alison is absolutely awesome! my friend who did my hair for me moved away and i've been bouncing salons and stylists since then. i mostly do my own hair (mediocrily) so my trips are few and far between. i first went to alison a couple months ago and she was the first to actually give me a cut i left happy with. since i had a good experience the last time i came back to her today and she remembered me and bits of our conversation from months ago. her personal approach and great conversation keeps me coming back. (plus the fact that she knows how to cut the way i like it). highly recommend!
"called in about 2p saturday to make an appointment for a shampoo, cut and style for my long, course curly hair. i'm pretty bold when it comes to my hair. i've shaved it, bleached it on my own, colored it own my own, had pretty much ever color in the rainbow on my hair. for the last four or so years, i've kept it natural from dyes and only trim. aside from using protective styles (braids) i really haven't done anything drastic to my hair...that is until 3 weeks ago. bored at home, i decided to cut my own bangs. what a failure that was! my hair is curly when i cut them and when i straighten it it looked horrible. when i made my appointment, i was assigned to allison who was totally understanding of my hair experiment. she was talkative, energetic and incredibly friendly during my visit. jose was also there being the vibrance of the salon. at the end of my cut and style, allison made my hair look absolutely incredible!! received lots of compliments on her work that evening. wow!!! so ecstatic with the result!!! she really has the magic touch. 10/10 would recommend. thanks allison!!"
"two thumbs up for jose. efficient, clean, careful, and precise with his cuts. he always follow instructions perfectly to the way i want my hair cut"
"i've been coming to supercuts for about 2-3 years now. hopped around a few times to other salons and barbershops, but none were as consistent, friendly, and fast as supercuts. i didn't mind who cut my hair in this location because all cuts ended up surpassing my expectations. recently walked in just to get my sides and back cut to a 1. jose spent extra time and care, and at one point, i swear he was about to strain his eyes focusing on my fade! i felt as if he used 7 different tools to cut my hair. love my cut and obviously will be back."
they did bad haircut on my son! they don't ask for details about hair cut. i am very disappointed from their service and never going back to any supercuts again!!
came here on a monday afternoon and it was very busy but the workers move quickly and i found myself with a cool cut pretty quickly. they really took their time to help me look good. the app to check-in is helpful as it can minimize wait time if you check in before you show up. it is a bit pricier than a great clips or fantastic sams but i feel you get what you pay for. i was happy with the cut and will be returning
"keep in mind that i can only speak to the eyebrow waxing service, but the whole experience has always been positive for the past 2+ years for me. diana is forever and always my favorite--she is so sweet and fast yet everything looks exactly as i like it. i have huge naturally arched eyebrows and prefer to just get them cleaned up a little bit than to get the spider eyebrows that i was always envious of and wanted back when they were in style in 2002. that being said, this location only really does ""clean ups"" and not so much styling/definition. for me, as this is all i want done, the end result has always been comparable to whenever i've gone to some fancy spa for $30+ per wax. the timing is fine, i've gone all different times of the day/afternoon and am always in and out in 30 minutes total."
"couldn't find another place on short notice to get my hair done. the place is nice not really busy. the girl that cut my hair did a good job i think her name was wona. i think their pricing for color is stupid. my hair barely goes to my shoulders and they charged me the most expensive price for ""long hair"" the prices are no better than other salons in downtown so all in all if you are in a rush and can't get an appointment for another place it works."
"nice place. my reservation is always honor. mara my stylist, was born on my birthday also. she does a good haircut, as requested. always look forward to the hot towel finish. there is a super cuts app, you can download. i always use it. good place."
"absolute worst customer service ever!  i decided to give it another try as the last nightmare stylist was no longer there.   so i go in for a simple quick hair shampoo again and the woman who washes my hair tells me not come back again because she is ""not allowed "" to scrub my head harder and give 3 shampoos because it is a waste of her time and energy!!!!!!  r e a l l y?????  no class or professionalism at supercuts fort lee.  never again!!!! boycotted for good!!!! doesn't even deserve one star but had to write this review"
i usually get cuts color and hair treatments here for past 4 years and all the girls are friendly and they all are professionally experienced. they know what they're doing and what customers want. great easy location too
claudiana rocks! my husband and 2 year old son go to her and she does a great job every time. i'm not crazy about their way of taking appointments but that's not her fault. she always has people waiting for her and she does a great job organizing her clients while giving great customer service. i hope she stays forever!
"trashy example of customer service. ive been taking my kids to supercuts in hackensack but their stylist was not there, so i went to fort lee's location and checked in online and it said no wait. i get there and i get a rude introduction. apparently, if youre russian, youll receive preferential treatment. once the stylist finished the previous customer, she takes a crazy amount of time to get the guy on his way. at 40 minutes, i stood up and told my son to lets go. here she comes..... im coming, hold on! and shes shouting as were walking out! needless to say, my 2 year old was not amused with this crackpots attitude. im disappointed in supercuts as a brand and for hiring that waste of oxygen."
"terrible service. staff is terrible. they are rude and insulting. the only person i enjoyed moved to hackensack and i tried going after, but they are just so rude. i will never go back again."
cheap. rather dirty. ever hairdressers themselves. don't have haircuts. $14 bucks for a haircut. had to wait for 45 min.go elsewhere if you anything more than low price.
"i walked in 30 minutes before closing to get a haircut and was taken care of by alyssa, who said she's been working here for seven years. even though i have a short and simple hairstyle, she did a great job and only took fifteen minutes! i was so impressed that i made a yelp account to write this review. will go here again."
i took my son in for a haircut and it came out totally wrong not how i pictured it or in the magazine photo which i've shown to the stylist. back of the head groomed and trimmed nicely but what happened to the front or side profile? we were pressed for time for another appointment therefore couldn't fix the problem. alyssa cut my son hair very quickly that day. i don't think i'll be returning to super cut any time soon.
"get your story straight. elizabeth made me have two people cut front of me who didn't have appointments with yin that day because i refused to get a haircut with her last min on the walk in. she straight up lied and said that guy called in advance and yin confirmed that guy didn't call or did he even ask for her. she made me wait because i denied her that day after i said yes to her at first and then declined because i remembered the previous garbage haircut i got from her about a month ago. the fade was so bad, i could seriously do it better with two mirrors. you want pictures? cause i have it. after i got the hair cut, i walked to my car and realized it was so messed up, i walked back in so that she could fix it . to make it even more entertaining, i went home took a shower and it was still fked up. i took a picture for humor.  false review ? again the 2nd visit: i made the appointment on the app after i declined and made it with yin. i was the next person to get a haircut and magically two walk ins that came after me got a haircut with directly with yin. ( yin had no appointments besides me) the reason was that the guy "" called "" which was a lie by elizabeth cause the guy who actually called for a walk in (not request for yin) came in about 40'mins after that walk in guy got the hair cut with yin. there was like 4 people cutting hair and 2 of those girls just standing around. why did elizabeth straight up lie and put the 2 walk in that didn't request yin with yin and the best part the walk in that came after me didn't even call( wrong person), while i was clearly waiting for her for and only her ? and while 2 other girls just talking and doing nothing ? what is your name? let's escalate this. you either have to be elizabeth or just ignorant and you don't have a clue what the heck is going on."
"worst haircut i've ever had in my life.i question this person's credentials about cutting hair...she just pulled out the trimmer, played around with my head, then used a scissor (3 slices). down... took 5 minutes or less.i didn't even want to pay for this, i actually had to go to another barbershop, to get precise cuts after. she failed every category within cutting hair. do not come here."
"i like that they have the same stylists working there for years. my favorite ones are donna and patricia. my only complaint is that this location is so popular the lines are sometimes long (call beforehand to put your name down). also, the last two times my haircuts turned out to be asymmetrical, which luckily gained me lots of compliments. i tried edgewater location for a change, but it was a disaster, so i'm coming back to fort lee. also, fort lee location is corporate so employees get health benefits, which is important for me from social compliance point of view.supercuts are great for wash and haircut only. anything more, and it gets more expensive and rushed than regular salons."
will never go to this supercuts again. asked for a 1 inch trim on my hair and received about 3 inches off which is fine. then the lady proceeded to try and give my front layers without my permission. the end result was an extremely uneven haircut. i'm not sure what she was trying to do because i do not have layers or a face frame at all. it looks like she just decided to chop an inch off without angling it at all. other pieces at the back are also unevenly cut.
"i check in on line, jen hooked me up, took the time and put the workmanship i expect when i get cut up.  thanks, i will be back next time i am in the area."
"had a 6:30 appt and waited for a half hour. i walked out without getting my haircut.  i wasn't waiting for anyone in particular so there were two women free. one just stared at me from the back of the store after she was done cutting a young man's hair. then once the other women freed up she spent about 20 minutes ringing up a customer because the reception girl was not competent enough to ring up a customer. instead she just kept yapping away with a person who wasn't even a customer. this place is awful, they are lazy and rude. i could understand if i was waiting for someone to finish up but they had no customers for a half hour while i waited way past my appt time."
"i was going to the supercuts in fort lee because jen was there and she was their best stylist in my opinion. well, she no longer works there. i was told by ""management"" that she quit. she's the only stylist who i'll allow to cut my hair. if anyone knows what happened, please post it here and if jen is working somewhere else please post that info here too. i would like to know and so would her loyal customers. thanks."
"with supercuts, you never know how good the skills of the person cutting your hair is going to be. this doesn't concern me too much as my needs are simple and the rare bad haircut grows out pretty quickly. what irks me about this supercuts is that on two separate occasions the person checking me in neglected to tell me that there was an hour's worth of customers ahead of me who had called in. (there were only a couple of people waiting in the store.) after a 40 minute wait today i mentioned it to the employee and she then told me i still had a wait. when i suggested the wait time could have been communicated when i first came in she rolled her eyes. at that point i left. there are lots of other places to get a cheap haircut without having to encounter a long wait and an attitude."
"this place is great for my needs.  i think when people come here they can't expect a lot.  if you really cared about how your hair really looked then you wouldn't be coming here.  let's face it if you are coming here, you are coming here to save money and that's it.  my haircut is easy to cut and for 14 bucks it's perfect.tips, call about an hour in advance and have them put your name down.  this will make the wait a lot shorter."
"this is a nice supercuts but this review is for their stylist, melissa.  i've been coming to her since november. she is a very good listener, understands how i want my hair cut, and is a joy to be around.  she cut my husband's hair as well and he was also very pleased.  i finally found someone i can trust at an affordable price!  i have a very short haircut and it's a struggle to make it look feminine and she nails it every time.  love her :-)"
"having written this nice review below, i got butchered by my regular barber here. god, i look like hell. :-("
"amazing experience. mimi, the woman who cut my hair was very friendly and made me feel at home. my hair came out better than i could have imagined. i liked the product she used in my hair and she even gave me a discount."
always take good care of me & family.  nothing pretentious.occasionally i get coupons & hair products on sale a lot.no complaints!!!
"so i went here on a whim a few days ago while shopping bc i really needed my hair cut but with christmas around the corner i really didn't wanna spend that much on just a trim so i saw this place and one of the girls was available, megan. she was so nice! so sweet & so good! i got a blunt cut & honestly was a little worried i'd notice some unevenness days later (bc blunt cuts are actually harder bc u can't hide it in layers) but i didn't it's amazing! i will be goin back that's for sure love this place! not to mention super clean too!! awesome thanks again!"
great experience. place was clean and had a good vibe. most importantly got a perfect hair cut. happy that i found a place so close to where i work. definitely will be coming back
"i had a great experience at this salon! megen was accommodating, professional, and creative! i had no wait time and walked out with the perfect hair style. i highly recommend megen and this salon location! you won't be disappointed!"
great place! everyone is so nice & friendly! i called ahead and didn't have to wait ( i loved that) megan cut my hair perfect! she is so sweet and very friendly and easy to talk to. i will definitely be back!!
"i am taking back my good review for supercuts in upper montclair. it was very upsetting to hear they pushed my hairdresser out. mark is a great hairdresser. he was excited to get an opportunity for advancement last time i got my hair done. he was then overlooked for his promotion.very upsetting.the managers in this place always have unhappy faces and act like they are doing you a favor. mark always has positive vibe. he acts like you are the most important person when you get your hair done. i asked him why he was rejected for his promotion. the manager of the nj area told him he was not fast enough. that is a complete lie. he does my face frame in a very short time. it's always perfect. the other hairdressers take over a half hour and never get it perfect. another friend of mine told me he gets his hair done in 5 minutes.  i recently found out he goes here too. he was also very upset when i told him.when i came in to get my haircut, mark was working with a girl who could not do the face frame correctly. he came over and fixed it for her. he was very professional and worked with her as a team player. he did not make her feel any less qualified in the way he went about it. those were great management skills. ever since i have been so happy. every time i get my hair cut i get compliments from everyone after my haircut. even strangers at the supermarket.i came to find out that many other people i know have discovered mark. he has a big following.i have been going to this location for years. every time i get a good hairdresser they leave. i had started with danielle who left. david was my previous hairdresser. he also left and moved to a high end salon which i can not afford. i found out he comes to get his haircut with mark too!!so mark wanted to stay and make this job a career. it helped local people to have a great hairdresser for an affordable price in this bad economy. life is hard enough. now i have to deal with this!"
"i called early on a saturday morning, seeing if i could get an appointment, and i was able to come right in for the first appointment that same day for a dye and trim.  this was huge for me because i have a pretty busy schedule and can't always make appointments so far in advance.  the staff was courteous and professional, the place was very clean and they did a great job on my hair.  i will definitely go back.  highly recommend!"
"i know it's a $15 haircut, but does it really have to be that difficult? have been going to his location for over a year and they used to be really good. however lately something has changed. this upper montclair supercuts location now has everything: bad service and incompetence. horrible attitudes by staff. like mcdonalds but with haircuts. there are so many competitors and other supercuts locations with hair stylists that take pride in their work unlike this location. unless you prefer crappy service and bad haircuts i don't recommend this upper montclair location."
"great salon, clean, and efficient. i used to come here all the time until my schedule changed.vera did a great job with my haircut!"
i loved the way alex cut my hard to manage hair. now she has moved elsewhere. would be great if anyone can forward her my email so that i can find her.
"we walked in there at 6:40 pm and were told that they were closing at 7 and couldn't take anymore haircuts. i explained that there was still 20minutes left and the cut was for my son who is 5 and takes about 10 minutes to cut his hair. they then told me that there was another person waiting but when that person said he wasn't actually getting a haircut (was waiting with someone else) the woman reluctantly said she would take my son. while my son was getting his haircut another hairdresser berated me for showing up so close to closing time and that their policy was not to take customers 1/2 before closing. he explained that there is a lengthy process to cleaning up and shutting down (aka we are lazy, hate that we actually cut hair at supercuts and want to be out of here at 7 pm sharp). it was clear that he was being nasty after getting a lousy tip from a previous client which he loudly complained about just moments earlier. i told him that there was no clear explanation about this alleged policy on the website and he told me i needed  to be more prepared. thanks for the life lesson mr supercuts and i am sorry that this will be the only job as a hairstylist you'll ever get. on a side note, my son's haircut sucked and the woman barely cut anything off. stay far away from this supercuts.. agree with other reviews aboit incompetence and horrible attitudes. they have major chips on their shoulders and take it out on customers."
very friendly atmosphere. unlike it used to be. its a convienet spot based on where i live. with the new staff came a new upbeat atmosphere. great place. great cut!
"i've been here four times and i've had excellent haircuts every time. a special shout out to vera, lily and cara. shop is clean and the staff is friendly."
"my worst haircut ever!! the young lady who cut my hair spent almost an hour and obviously she has no idea how to do the job right, i need a wig for at least two months.never this place again!!!"
"great for what it is.  this is not a high end salon, no do they claim to be.  plenty of stylists are always working, i lucked out and got one that i like, however i'm pretty sure you can request someone specific if you like.  it is very clean and everyone is very nice. can't beat the price for the results. they do not take appointments but if you call ahead they will put your name on the list."
wow. i feel like i should have paid them more for the haircut and color they gave me. it was one of the best i have ever had. jordyn (sp?) was my stylist and she was amazing. she listened to me. she talked me through everything she was doing. she created a custom color for me that was the best i have had. people can't stop raving about my amazing a-line bob. i adore this girl and will totally be back!
"worst place. i don't ask for much when i get my hair cut, just a basic trim with layers. this time around, i was told that she ""won't cut my hair like that"" and cut it the way she thought was best. i explained i've had the same cut for years, and she said that she refused to cut it that way and if i wanted a cut, it would be a basic trim. i could not believe how rude and unprofessional my experience was, and given that my hair now resembles a wet dog, i definitely won't be coming back."
"dont' let a girl named sasha get within a mile's radius of your hair. not sure it she still works there, but she could make a lawn cry after mowing it. to add insult to injury, she has a hard time listening and following the customer's requests. somebody please form a coalition and stop her!"
"they ruined my hair.  i will never be going back here.  they dyed my hair with black permanent hair dye (jet black) when i asked for a semi permanent dark brown.  they messed up and tried to add more brown tones, but they dried out my hair, it turned red.  service is terrible, they gossip about their customers (they spoke about me when they were doing my hair, two stylists were whispering nasty things about my hair).  just rude.  and expensive!  don't let that one dollar sign on this yelp page confuse you.  i have long hair, but to wash, color, trim and blow out my hair costed me $200.  go to bangz, they're (surprisingly) cheaper, cleaner, friendlier and they know what they're doing!"
"this is near my work so i like to come in for a trim on occasion (that being twice now). i've had good experiences both times. when i went there was no wait, but there was only one hairdresser working, so if you come at a time like that you can get stuck waiting for a while.granted it took longer than i expected, but my hairdresser was very thorough. my hairdresser (lindsey according to recepit) was friendly and took the time to cut my layers and make it look really nice. it wasn't much of a change length wise but it got rid of the heaviness of my hair without drastically changing it. and the price is definitely good. i can't speak to more complicated style proficiency, but it's good for what i need and it's next to some shopping and some eateries so it's easy to squeeze it in while running errands."
"oh my god are they slow. if you've got an hour or two, probably a good place to get your hair cut. check in online, if not people that come in will keep getting called in front of you. not a problem normally, but since they cut hair in slow motion...it's a must."
"i walked in without an appointment so i didn't mind the wait. while i waited i went on yelp to peek at the reviews. was a little skeptical seeing the more recent reviews since they were negative. ashley cut my hair and she did a great job. she was friendly to talk to and did exactly what i asked for. the other girls there seemed nice but i can only speak for the one who cut my hair. i'd happily return, can't beat the price!"
i came in for the blow dry and while people were super nice they had no idea how to do simple blow dryi left with flat hair that looks like i have asked my baby sister to do it and they put tons of oil on it so will have to wash it as soon as i get home...
"stephanie, was a very sociable kind worker that took time on me and my boyfriend hair. very friendly and great personality."
"i get a very simple haircut. 3 on the sides, 4 on top, straight across at the ears. my haircut was exactly like i wanted. the store was clean and well lit. the stylist was polite and quick."
"whoaaa dhaval...!! thats exactly opposite of who marquita is. one of the best hair stylist i have ever seen. she is very friendly, takes her time and very professional. she suggested some products for my hair and turns out they suite best for me. i have been going here from past one year and always had best experience with marquita. highly recommend her people who are going for the first time!"
"needed a nice haircut for an upcoming holiday party. walked in and got a stylist named marquita. best cut ever! the girl's got skills. she was way cool and very professional. i had to write a review because i don't know what dhaval d is talking about. people might read that and go in with the wrong attitude. marquita took her time and was extremely friendly and thorough. you can tell that she loves what she does and takes it seriously. she also played great music the whole time. long story short, i look like a f&@king stud. totally going back to her."
rude and unprofessional.  the employees would rather converse/gossip with one another than do their job.  i've been there 3 times (only because the haircuts are relatively inexpensive) and something went wrong with each visit.  i won't be going back.  don't waste your time or money going to this establishment.
"worst choice ever!!! got one star because they need it in order to write the review.   brought my 12 yr old son to get a trim and patricia starts cutting his hair with obviously no clue on what she was doing.  the 2nd hairdresser takes her scissors away from her and starts cutting his hair.  i felt better as it was obvious the first one didn't know what she was doing. but then people came in and the 2nd one left him to take a new client.  patricia tells me he's done, he puts on his hoodie, i pay, tip patricia and when i get home this is atrocity he was left with.    a 3 yr old child with scissors on his hand for the first time would've done a better job.  the head looks like if it's split in half with double the amount of hair on one side.    it's obvious, that if this so called hairdresser thinks thats even, she either needs to get glasses or go to beauty school for the first time.  i was forced to come back and get someone else to work on his hair and try to fix the damage.    i donot recommend this place.    first and last time."
"not your average supercuts! like most guys, i wouldn't go here if it was the last place to go, but i needed a haircut in a rush so i had no choice. ashley cut my hair the first time i came here, since then she's been the only one to cut my hair. very professional, and very good haircut, wouldn't go anywhere else."
i came in for a haircut since the last one was uneven and i was greeted by cassandra.  she was a very nice and listened to my concerns.  i felt and looked great. i love her attention to detail.  definitely coming back.
"won't be back. checked in for two people at 2 pm for 6:30 appointments. did both check ins at the same time. got my haircut and they tried to skip the other person and even argued with us about it. if it wasn't for the nice gentleman letting the other person go ahead of him, like the system should have done anyway, we would have walked out. don't bother wasting your time here. so slow as well."
"beware of the stylist marquita!! extremely rude, arrogant and also messed up my hair. i am not the one to write bad reviews . . i usually let it go as ppl can have good and bad days. but this time i was royally pissed off . . i have been going to this place since past 3 years and most of them have been pretty good. but this lady was something. . she went on sooo fast like she was trying to break a record for fastest haircut. she screwed up my sideburns. you don't mess with people's hair!! my usual stylist was felicia but was told she no longer works there so i thought might as well go along with someone else... what a mistake!!"
"when i go to a supercuts location, i heavily rely on yelp reviews to pick the right hair dresser/stylist for me.  so when we moved nearby, i relied on none other than yelp reviews to figure out who i wanted to cut my hair.i got my hair cut with lindsey and she gave me the most perfect adorable haircut when i was going from long to short hair which was a drastic change.  she is awesome at her job and knows her stuff. she also consistently asks you for your feedback on if her hair cutting is looking the way you want.  my hair is super curly and because i alternate between curly and straight hair, the cut has to be at a certain length for both styles to work.  lindsey always gets it right! she is the only one i go to at this supercuts and i have always left happy."
"supercuts is my go-to place for my hairstyling needs and i was excited when a location opened in secaucus. lindsay was the first to cut my hair over a year ago and i'm happy to see that she is still there.jillian was my stylist for my recent coloring needs and she did an excellent job with my highlights and understood my love of red. she helped make the time pass with great conversation and made me feel like a vip.the ladies are friendly and take the time to listen to your hair wants. i have no problem letting them make recommendations and getting a little creative.give them a try, you won't regret it!"
"lisa has been cutting my hair for a couple years, and she is the best one they have.  there is always a line for her to cut someone's hair, thank you lisa."
"i've been going there for a while always had excellent service. the place used to be open 9-9, but a sign on the door now says due to staffing shortages they're open 11-7. michael cut my hair he had no idea what he was doing! after i left i got an email from them asking me about my experience. i totally blasted them & gave very specific examples of why i was unhappy. never heard back from them. they just lost a loyal customer."
they don't know what they are doing. they cut hair unevenly and now i have to go fix it some place. never again!they offered to not take a fee for the haircut .. which does not fix anything.
warning! this review comes from someone who has visited this salon quite a few times and has constantly had only bad experience. unprofessional and inexperienced people cut and style hair here. they somehow make your hair look way worse than it was before! long waiting time and extremely poor management adds to the fury! beware of one mr.michael who ruins the complete look of your hair. he has a bad sense of hair styling and gives a very uneven hair cut.think twice before you lend your hair to him! both me and my husband have been returning customers as it is the closest to our home. but we have realized that it is time to look out for a better salon that makes the whole experience and money spent worthwhile.
"i was looking for a place to get a haircut and i had never been to a supercuts before, so i decided to try things out. it was during the afternoon so there were several other people already waiting. they have spots to sit up at the front and back of the store to wait.  i ended up waiting about 20-25 minutes to be called. once i was called, the haircut was done relatively quickly and it went very smoothly. typically i get buzz cuts or beard trims so the kinds of haircuts i get are relatively easier to manage then most. my hairstylist was wonderful and was very accommodating. if i'm in the area again, i might visit. the facility isn't as clean or flashy as other places but it gets the job done."
"disclaimer: i didn't get a haircut.checking in online is literally the same as walking in off the street. you should ask them what the difference is if you want to be amused.i ""checked in"" at the time i had chosen online and still had to wait. and wait. and wait. and then i had to leave because this is new york city and ain't nobody got time for that. i'd rather pay more at a salon that is organized to get a better cut because my time is money. and all i wanted to do was donate 9"" to pantene beautiful lengths! byeee"
"wait time is wildly inaccurate. sat waiting for a half hour past my check in time when there ""zero wait time"" listed. had i stayed it likely would have been another half hour!!! whats the point of having the checkin?? beyond that, employees were extremely rude and dismissive. dont bother giving your business to this place."
"horrible experience! horrible!the black woman working there is a racist.  she had such a attitude to me since i came in. i am not expecting a good survey, but at least you can give some smile. she treated me like some homeless people begging for her to get a haircut. and i gave her my phonr number, she had that disgusting look on her face and said where is that at. itold her philadelphia, then she shaked her head. i was like wtf is that supposed to mean. afterwards, i sit on the chair and she asked what do i want for hairstyle. she still talked in an attitude which made me so confused and uncomfortable. i have never been there before but i swear i will never go there any time. she kept shaking head and her facial expression was so disgusting when i show the picture of the hairstyle i want. then she kept asking me what do i want her to do. i had a scar that i want to cover, but for some reason she said she cannot do that. so i walked out. i am so sick of her attitude. there are plenty of barbers around here.i will never recommend anyone to go there. also, i regret even step into the barbershop because of the horrible experience.honestly. i do not want to give 1 star. it should be negative."
"as others have mentioned, there is no point to checking in ahead.  for the 4th time in a row, i've show up for check-in at least 10 minutes ahead of the check-in time and at that exact time, they take someone who has been waiting, but did not check in.  10 minutes after, they called me. haircut is always fine, but not worth the frustration."
"i needed a refresh to my good haircut and couldn't wait for my usual stylist appointment, so i stopped by supercuts at university place.  waited 3 minutes and was seen by shana.  i explained that i wanted a trim and shape up, she was ready to start cutting. i told her i'd like a wash first.  the shampooing was fine.  we made a little small talk, she said she's been cutting hair for 10 years.  great, i thought.she began cutting and seemed alright. i told her i'd like a bit of fringe in the front, just some wispy bits, nothing heavy.  she sectioned off the front, and showed me, i had her reduce the section, reminding her i just want some fringe, not bangs.  i showed her the length, to the middle of my nose, nothing short, just some bits.  she began to cut.the next thing i knew, she stepped to the side, pulled out the hair dryer, fluffed with her hands, no brush, for 3-5 seconds and said we were done!  the first thing i saw in the mirror was me with short bangs above my brows!  omg and wtf i told her this is not what i wanted, or asked for!she said, ""i cut to the middle of your nose like you said.i told her to blowout the rest.""""oh you want a blowout?  i thought you just wanted a cut. that's more money!""she excused herself and scurried away to rinse another customer, leaving me in the chair.  the rest of the cut is fair, not good.  the new bangs she gave me do not even blend with the sides.  moreover, the cut looks like something from the 1970's.  i decided to get up and settle the bill and go.how does a hairstylist make a living not listening to the client/customer/guest?!?stay away from shana at supercuts in the village"
"maxine was the best. she not only gave me a great quality haircut, but she was incredibly entertaining. for $23 i felt like i got a haircut and a show. i will definitely be returning to this salon in the future. can't express how friendly the service was"
worst haircut. simple men's trim and tyrone sent me out with wet matted down hair.   only after returning to work and my hair drying  did i learn that he had done such a poor job that my co workers had to share with me the bad news.   he clipped the sides with a #2 bit forgot on the left side to blend it in to the top.   this left an embarrassing and ugly haircut.  i hope that this was merely a case of tyrone being incompetent or not caring about his work.    he would not speak to me but instead gossiped continuously with his co-worker.
"i came in as a walk in and was told it would be a 15 minute wait but i can back before then and the barber, tyrone was waiting for me.he gave me a wonderful haircut and was really pleasant to talk to. haircut came put exactly to the picture of what i wanted.  highly recommend.in a city filled with barbers it's hard to find a good one, respect!!!"
"everyone here is great. they are all dedicated workers and will try their very best to meet with customers expectation. you describe what you want, and they will help you along the way. my favorite, juana, is a very kind and very happy person. she's very good with children so for those parents who want someone who's going to do well with your child's haircut, i definitely recommend her! irene is also a very lovely worker here in this establishment!"
"went in for a blowdry and the guy there did a good job on my hair. it was a pretty high price, though ($37).the reason i'm giving 3 stars instead of 4 is because when i tipped $3 (which is the usual amount where i'm from) the guy who styles me said ""no offense but in the 10-20 years i've been doing hair i've never been tipped $3"". i guess the usual tip amount in the us is higher (he said its usually 5-10)? it made me feel really bad, but i had already paid and didn't have cash on me. slighty rude of the guy, though, but it was a good quality style."
"tyrone @ supercuts, university place is the very best cutter, stylist i ever had!!i found him in westchester ny and now traveldown to greenwich village for a haircutas he is the mgr in university place store!"
black people should never stop here even if you are desperate. not a good experience. the woman that just cut my hair was awful. she didn't take time. didn't try to blend and left bald spots. she also kept poking me in the head with clippers. i knew better but decided to just end my day with a terrible haircut.
"i called ahead for my appointment - i waited about 10 minutes on arrival and was placed with a stylist. she listened to my request (a simple, unlayered, blunt bob) and followed through perfectly. i paid $27 and couldn't be more pleased... especially as this trip was to correct the work of an overzealous and inattentive stylist at a trendy salon in bushwick. i'll be coming to this supercuts from now on - nothing is more valuable than someone who is willing to cut you hair the way you ask!"
i originally had an appointment with another salon but the man working there wouldn't cut my hair because he thought i was a woman. after that experience i decided to try my luck at supercuts and was not disappointed. i was seated after about five minutes of walking in and got exactly what i wanted! the stylist i had was very nice and had my hair all done in no time. i would highly recommend coming here and with their prices it really can't be beat!
"i had a long wait time, but this wasn't their fault. it was very busy and i didn't have an appointment.tatyana did a fantastic job on my cut! i love it. as others have mentioned, the place isn't super clean but i don't think it's unreasonable for what you pay for either. the stylists tools are cleaned after ever guest and that's all that matters to me!i will return. for people who are no fuss with their hair, you can't beat the ease and price!"
"i usually go to another location which does my hair perfectly every time but i  had an appointment a few blocks away so i had to settle for this one. went in on a monday at 1pm and was the only customer. the two stylists there were annoyed and weren't doing anything. explained what i wanted and showed the stylist a picture and she swatted the picture away saying ""yeah i know"" without looking at it and rolling her eyes and sucking her teeth. all i wanted was a wash, trim, and blow out of my long layered bob and bangs. she cut it too short so now its all one length and blew it out and curled the ends under. i left upset and looking like a mushroom. phone kept ringing and she and the other stylist kept complaining about this phone meeting they were going to have at 4pm and refused to answer the phone the entire time i was there probably to avoid customers. the place is also dark, drab and dirty. was asked to set my purse down on the floor by my feet while sitting in the chair when i spotted what looked like thick dried coffee or chocolate splattered on the walls under the table and floors that no one bothered to clean. i then picked up my purse and held it on my lap the whole time. they also don't dust, sweep or mop the floors. filthiest salon i've ever been to."
"i was so happy with my haircut here recently.  i went at lunch time and there was no wait.  i was taken right away, and i usually get simple-type cuts.  but even then, many places don't do it right.  how hard is it to layer?  well, the girl i got knew how to layer and framed my face so nicely.  she did a great job.  i have had the best haircuts in my life at supercuts and great clips and the worst at high-priced salons.  i never have coloring done, so i can't speak to that.  i also don't have contemporary/trendy/experimental cuts, so i can't speak to that.  i know it depends on the stylist you get, because i've had some blah experiences at these places too, but this was a great cut."
"had the sweetest lady trim my hair today. she gave me a clean, even cut in no time. thanks supercuts!"
"i go to this place because my cut is simple: #1 on my entire head. if you go after 7pm on weekdays you get half off.  i have been here twice and have had something negative both times.#1 i got my standard buzz cut and was looking great. the barber was finishing up the back of my neck when she decided to _really_ dig in. my nexk was nearly scraped raw. it burned when i touched so when i got home i had my wife look at it and there were visible parallel scratch marks that broke the skin, traveling from the base of my neck to my hairline. i was sore for a few days.#2 i arrived at 7pm and there were 4 busy barbers, 3 waiting customers. i was set to see a movie at 8 and my cut takes about 5 minutes, so i figured i had plenty of time. i was wrong. if the barbers were a bit more efficient i would have made it, but each one took a 10 minute break between customers. at 7:45 i was next and a barber had finished her customer. then decided to take a break and didn't return. she was still in the building, just not cutting any hair. i had to wait until 8:05pm for the next barber to finish her customer, and finish her break before getting my cut.i know i could call ahead to minimize the wait, but i don't really mind it. i do mind the laziness of these barbers though. i bet that they get paid by the hour instead of by the client, so there is little incentive to speed things along. even with the half-off pricing post-7pm, i am still going to look elsewhere for a place to take my simple cut."
"if you just need a basic haircut, i've been to supercuts a few times and it's been a great option. most recently, i went right when it opened and was taken right away. i have straight hair and asked for two inches trimmed off and got exactly that (i've been to fancier places where somehow 2 inches turned to them cutting off 5). the hair dresser did a great job, it took 15 minutes, and, even with a 20% tip, the total cost was less than $30. i feel embarrassed thinking i used to get the exact same cut for over $70! i'm confused when i see people putting 1 star review for supercuts when they need their hair dyed/wanted something fancy because i would never go here for something like that, but for a basic cut, it's been perfect!"
"this place is awful. i was last here years ago and got a really bad haircut but supercuts is so close to my apartment and so convenient. this time around, i just needed a few inches cut off my hair but while i was waiting i saw the manager be super rude to ppl. one customer was explaining what she wanted and the manager was so rude. the manager made a snide remark about results and the customer being picky. then an elderly guy asked the manager a question about the charge to his credit card while he was being rung up and she was so rude, i cringed. and then i left. get your haircut somewhere else. customer service is last in this place."
"the worst horrible haircut in my  life, the cut was great but the idiot sprayed my hair with a thinning solution that all but destroyed my hair, if it gets any thinner i will be bald and then i  will sue super cuts."
great haircut gladys did an awesome job and she also have me tips that were very helpful. as the saying goes you get what you pay for so keep that in mind. i've been getting my hair cut at supercuts for as long as i can remember and i've never had an issue. but i'm just one little ole person what do i know.
went in for a fade and trim on top and walked out with choppy hair. it was near closing on a friday and i had to ask the stylist twice to blend the sides in better. she was pleasant but should not be cutting hair. i had to go to another barber the next day to get it fixed.
"surprised at all the negative reviews below.  this is a cheap no-frills place... and it was totally fine as such!  walked in and asked for a roots touch-up.  yvonne was available, she immediately quoted me the cost ($40) and took me in.  she was nice but not super-chatty which was just as well.  the whole thing (coloring, washing, brushing and styling) took about an hour, and she was gentle combing my super-curly easily tangled hair.  she did a nice job with the color, too.i have a feeling people with negative reviews are expecting something along the lines of fancier salons... while this one is market with one dollar sign for a reason.  my expectations were perfectly met.i'll gladly be back."
"whatever you do, do not let maria cut your hair. she gave me attitude the entire time, even though my cut was nothing fancy - i only came in to trim the ends and touch up the layers. she acted like i was asking for the most elaborate and complicated style she had ever seen and argued with me when i explained that i did not have an angle, i simply was growing out bangs so it appeared to be an angle. the worst part, however, was when she flat out told me, ""well i don't like it, but if you do, then whatever."" maybe stylists here should be advised to keep unsolicited advice to themselves, especially when it's rude. if you're going to offer criticism, at least a. wait until i ask for your opinion or b. offer a suggestion for what you think, as a stylist, would look better, instead of just telling me that you don't like my cut... especially considering you just cut it. also considering i only got a trim, she was essentially insulting my hair in general. other than that, be prepared for a long wait, filled with watching the stylists chat about what they're doing that night, while no one's hair is being cut. and beware if you have a cartilage piercing! mine was not so gently ripped out with a comb. take it out beforehand (shouldn't hair stylists know how to handle those?) unless you want an additional hole in your ear."
"i thought i was getting a good deal for getting to the tips of my hair dyed deep red. the stylist seemed to be working on more of my hair than i had asked for, so i confirmed what i wanted and showed her a picture, and she said she knew what she was doing. i left with 3/4 of my hair dyed a terrible orange red, and she charged me $20 that what i had originally wanted for some ""extra process."" i went home and dyed it back to my natural brown. tl;dr you could dye your hair better in your own sink."
went in for a straight trim across the bottom - no layers or angles. came out with two completely different haircuts on each side of my head. not sure i can rock this look.
does this look even to you?? clearly the hack that provided this cut thought it was perfectly even. by far the worst haircut i've ever received.
"one of the worst things about moving somewhere new is finding a decent hairdresser that won't charge you a small fortune. so i thought i would give supercuts a go because i'm generally not fussy with my hair, it's just around the corner and i'm on a budget. i should have known better. i don't even know what the stylists name was - she was blonde, surly and didn't even say hello or ask how i was. that's bare bones politeness in my opinion. i prefer not making small talk when getting a haircut, but general pleasantness should be expected. anyway - i would forgive all that if it weren't for the monstrosity of a haircut this woman bestowed upon me. it's completely uneven, hacked into on one side so much that it looks like a four year old took to one side of my head with some kitchen scissors. the ends have been chopped so bluntly, it's hideous. for the style i asked for, she should have done that zig-zag type technique on the ends. absolutely no texturing to thin out my thick hair and give it some shape through the bulkier bits....nothing. and the way my hair sits, it literally just looks like she forgot to cut the back bit. i look like i'm growing out an awful bob-mullet hybrid. the only saving grace is that i can still fit my hair back into a pony tail to hide how awful it looks when it's out. i shouldn't have walked out like that, but i didn't realise how bad it was until i got home and examined it closely. it's truly the worst haircut i've ever had. and for someone who really isn't fussy about their hair...that's saying something. i even cried because it was so damn ugly. i've tried a multitude of ways to style it, but it doesn't matter what i do...it just looks terrible. i'm going to have to get it fixed by someone else now, so instead of just originally paying someone a decent amount to cut my hair properly, i have now wasted almost $30 to have some stink eye hack ruin my hair. i'm also going to have to cut it much shorter than i originally wanted to fix what she's done. thanks a lot supercuts. never ever ever again. i would probably only recommend this place to someone i hate."
"i'm one of those girls that does not care about my hair. it's long, very fine, i don't have a lot of it, and pricy haircuts in the past have not made a huge difference in terms of the look/feel. as long as i get an even haircut with subtle layers, i'm happy. with that said, i really like this place. there are no extra frills unless you want (and pay) for them. every stylist that has cut my hair here has been pretty good, and none have had an attitude (i've been coming here for two years). keep in mind that they are not going to be as experienced/skilled as stylists in more expensive salons, nor should they be since you're only paying $21 for your haircut. this is the place to stop in for a trim or simple cut on your way home, not the place to go from waist length hair to a-line bob right before an event. if you keep it simple and don't have unrealistic expectations, you will walk out with a great haircut (and damp hair unless you want to pay extra for a blowout)."
"so many places in the city overcharge people for a simple haircut. not this place.  i got a wash, cut, and dry for a flat fee of 47 dollars.  there was no one there so i was immediately taken and the woman was so nice and she cut my hair to my liking.  a bit hesiate to go in the beginning because of the reviews but glad i went anyway"
she ruined my hair!!!! i said i wanted to keep length and she cut all of it off! livid!
"there are so many bad reviews that i feel like it's important to share my experience. i went for a wash and cut. gladys cut my hair, and was very professional and friendly. she also did not rush through the cut and did a nice job. i have no complaints."
"incompetent. went in for a trim and the person wouldn't do it. all they did was cut the bottom, not the layers. she never event touched the top. i asked her to and she said she can't do it. i ask he why can she simply said she can't do it, then stopped and and literally walked away. she said she wouldn't charge me, and she didn't, not even when i tried to tip her for her time (which i'm glad for now) but she left me with a butchered head. all i wanted was a trim. i said, ""trim everything an inch."" how is that so difficult?"""
"popped in on friday around 4pm. was seen immediately. great hair wash (good massaging) and the cut was good. very simple trim - about 1/2"" off the ends. will return for sure!"
"i really like this place ! i always do there highlight ,  haircut once even when i did highlight come over with my baby and they were ok with it i recommend this place.i would like to add that i very much like the price so i go there :)"
"horrible customer service, over priced, and no idea how to run a business. don't use the app to check in because it means nothing and you will still wait 2 hours!!!!"
"marisol is absolutely the best. i've been going to her for the past year and just absolutely love her. she gives a beautiful haircut , understands what you want, and makes you feel completely comfortable. i highly recommend her. she's as amazing as a hairdresser as she is a beautiful person inside."
ask angelica if you're getting a blow dry. definitely coming here instead of going to a blow dry bar. worth the money!
"gets the job done, i will definitely go back next time i need a haircut but this location is not as good as other supercuts i've been to.  rachel cut and washed my hair. i have a very basic style (straight across​) so i never like to spend more than $30 on a haircut.  she was a little rough on the shampooing, and during the cut she kept talking to other stylists which made me a little worried that she wasn't paying attention.  overall, i walked in on a saturday and didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes.  i don't know if i would recommend this place for intricate cuts or coloring.  but if you have a basic style, i'd recommend giving it a shot!"
been to many hair salons and can honestly say i was taken for my money. shareif is a life saver and life changer! he fixed the many many years of horrific hair damage i had done to myself. he also educated me to prevent future damage. his professionalism is over the top. no matter how busy he is he always carries a smile. any place would be extremely lucky to have him with such talent!
"i slip into supercuts every now and then if i need a trim or haircut/blowout and don't feel like paying my expensive regular salon prices. i went recently to jess and she did a great job. from the shampoo, to cut to blowout (which made my hair so soft and lasted for 3 days) i walked out very happy. on that particular day there was no wait which was a bonus as well. for the price and quality of the cut i received, i will return again."
it's second time i'm coming within opening hours and they tell me they're closed. if they only accept by appointment they should mention it. don't trust them...
"don't know the name of the woman that cut my husband hair yesterday, but from the way she cut my husband hair you would think it's her first time holding a  scissor/clippers. to top it off all the women working there look angry. we will never go there again. i recommend they hire more experienced hair dressers."
"i've gone here five times now because it's around the corner from where i live and cheap hoping it will finally be passable, and each time it was a disaster... uneven, like these people are holding scissors for the first time - i'm a guy with straight short hair, it's almost impossible to get wrong. also the staff are a tad unfriendly and snarky - one gets the sense they don't care one way or another."
"i must say this is the worst haircut experience i've ever had. the barber clearly had no idea what she was doing. the attitude was okay but the technique was awful. usually when i got a haircut and if there's something not perfect, i'll go back home trim a little to fix it. but this time it was so terrible that i can't even makes it right. i don't often leave a review on here especially if it's negative, but today i felt that i have the responsibility to tell the truth and remind others don't repeat my mistakes and end up like me."
"awful cut! i should have know better. unfortunately rachel doesn't know how to cut hair. each side was different lengths, lopsided etc. it was a mess. i had to go to someone else to make it look descent."
"worst service ever! they just made me wait 20 minutes only to tell me ""oh i'm sorry i don't feel comfortable washing and drying your hair""... because of my brain surgery scar! total waste of time and i felt very humiliated in front of all the other people waiting -they really need to learn how to deal with customers in a more polite manner ..that was horrible being ridiculed in front of other people"
"i was going to hoboken hair every other month because it was pretty cheap and close. i started to dislike the haircut i was receiving, even though it was kind of cheap. i decided i would give super cuts a try and boy am i glad i did. first of all sadé is my favorite. she gives a great cut and always has great recommendations for myself. great service and great prices."
"i called ahead to ask if i could come in for highlights and a cut. i was told i could make the appointment and was told the price for the service. while i was on my way to the appointment, they called me and asked if i could get there earlier because apparently they needed more time to do my hair, which was why i called to ask in the first place. when i told them i was almost there (which was even before my original appointment), they told me i couldn't come and that the price they originally gave me was not correct. this experience tells me that they are extremely disorganized. i would have liked to have been told that i couldn't come in the first place so that i was not rushing to the appointment. when i had previously been there for a cut, i had to wait, even when i had made an appointment and the stylists acted annoyed that i was even there. i will not be going back."
was exactly what i was looking for! 21$ including tip hair cut (no wash) and blow dry! shaday (spelling may be totally off) was sweet fast and professional!
"i had two great experiences at this salon. sade, was my stylist and she rocks. she gave me my best cut in the past five years.the online check-in service was helpful too."
"i have been going to this location for about 7 years and i had a very bad experience this morning. i had to mention this so others wont have this issue ever again. hopefully management will notice. it's been a couple weeks since i returned to get my normal haircut, with cindy and when i arrived at 8:05 this morning to get my haircut, i was told ""she doesn't work here anymore"" with an attitude. i thought nothing of it until they actually shut the door on me, when the hours state 8:00 am until 8:00 pm. i stood outside for a couple of minutes to wait and noticed they were drinking coffee in the back while i waited outside and it was 8:05 am. are you serious? that is so rude. why ? very bad hospitality. i would stay away from this location and go to the one on route 3. never again will i return."
"if i could give this place 0 stars and still leave a review i would. avoid at all costsi usually get my hair cut at super cuts, i just moved to the area and went here a few days before an interview to get my cut cleaned up and i walked out fuming.the girl cutting my hair left it choppy (in a bad way) and very visibly uneven. she cut my hair wet, dried it, showed it to me and i told her it wasn't what i wanted could she please fix it--she says ok and starts dry cutting my hair!! i have straight hair, it should not be dry cut, ever!i walked out very upset. i went to another local place -- avanti beauty -- and when the woman there saw my hair she said ""oh my god what did she do to you!""avoid. at. all. costs."
"$18 for a haircut is pretty steep.   the cut was fine, no complaints, but i can get the same cheaper elsewhere.i can say though that i had a short wait for a walk-in.  that's always a plus."
a very nice stylist named nailah cut my hair. she did a great job and was very pleasant. will definitely be going back again
"absolutely awful!!  if i could give it no stars i would. i set up an online appointment and when i walked in there were two women working and i was treated as though i was bothering them. and although there was no line, a man who had walked in a couple minutes before me with no appointment was taken before me and then i had to wait for the woman to sweep the floors and finish her conversation with her co-worker before she would take me. she also informed me that my appointment should have been cancelled since they only accept appointments made one hour in advance. there was no mention of this on the website and at the time, there was only myself and one guy in there. and again i felt unwelcome like i was bothering them! then, i asked for a simple trim straight across, nothing difficult. she cut my hair quickly and instead of thoroughly inspecting how straight my hair was cut (which is difficult since i have long dark hair that blends into the black cloak you have on), i assumed she cut it correctly and even gave her an $8 tip on an $18 trim. unfortunately, i came home washed and dried my hair and saw that it was completely chopped! a five year old could have done a better job!  i now need to go get it cut again in order to fix the mess she made of my hair!!  if i could reverse the charge, i would. i should not have to pay to be treated rudely and have my hair hacked!i will never go here again. i assumed anyone working at a hair place would understand what a straight line is and how to trim hair!! obviously not here....absolutely awful!!!!"
"dear long hairs: it is not worth it if you want to save money and/or time. trust me, you do not want to risk it.it is better if you wait one/two more days or simply spend the double or triple at a professional hair salon. sincerely,exlonghair girl."
"i still prefer going to my usual barbershop, but my schedule lately meant that last saturday was the only good day to get a haircut...and my boys are closed on saturday.so, with a 5k coming up this weekend, i need that aerodynamic boost that only my usual buzz cut can provide. do you even laws of physics, bro?anyway, supercuts was sufficient for a quick buzz. i guess they are used to more intricate work, and the ladies working there got a laugh when i said  ""just gimme a 2 on top, 1 on the sides, square in the back"" - i was probably one of the fastest cuts and easiest customers they've had to work on.it was a little pricier than my usual place (18 vs 15), but yeah, it was fine for me. ready to race!"
pros: i got in fast but it was also the middle of the day. the hair stylist i had did a good job on my hair. cons: the hairstylist i had wasn't too friendly. i also had a hard time understanding her because of her thick russian accent. when she was cutting my hair she kept pulling on it. it hurt so bad that my eyes watered.  for the love of god don't come here. save your money(also your beautiful locks) and don't come here. i do not recommend this place at all.
this is probably the worse place to get your hair cut. when i walked into this store the smell was so bad. they didn't do a good job on the haircut i had. one side hair was longer than the other. i've had better haircuts paying the same prices at other salons. i do not recommend.
"after my long-time hair dresser sadly quit and abandon me of eleven (11) years i had to find another hair salon, but with a budget i am unable to seek a high-end salon.  without an appointment, i waited five short minutes to be seated.  the hair dresser washed my hair with shampoo and conditioner and then cut it to my desired length as requested.  after the cut was completed she did not blow dried my hair leaving it wet as i roam in the streets of new york for the rest of the day.iman, my assigned hair dresser is not computer savvy as she does not know how to work a cash register to duplicate the hair cut transaction two times overcharging me.  i voiced her overcharge transaction loudly making her nearby colleague aware of her gross error which was evidently rectified.  the wash and cut came out to be $21.00 (with sales tax), but with this unpleasant register transaction plus no blow dry i gave iman a $4.00 tip."
this place is horrible went for a haircut showed the lady a picture of the haircut i wanted she asked if i wanted my hair trimmed she showed me a length to trim and told her yes and what happens she cuts it way past that and ends up cutting half the hair off of my head
"why can't fh have a decent place to get a haircut. after having a terrible experience at a barbershop in the same area i can here, and boy was that a mistake. immediately after being seated and my cut began, an angry customer came i. and took photos of the licenses of my stylist because he was outraged at the cut and customer service he received.it was too late for me to get up and leave so i had to sit through. she completely disregarded my instructions, kept asking ""how's this?"", didn't seem to understand how to blend as i had to remind her.  complexity missed my neckline, looked like some kind of weird rat tail / mullet situation.steer clear."
"today was my 2nd visit at super cuts of forest hills ny. susan did again a wonderful work on my pixie cut and color. i returned because as a busy mother, with tight schedule between soccer and over activities, i found that the cut and color susan mastered about three months ago, grew into a beautiful long pixie while the highlights she applied last time still last till this day, when she only needed to do my roots. as it grew i kept getting compliments on my long pixie and highlights and asked if i visited the salon recently. that's a bonus, yes cost and time effective, but most importantly, i didn't feel that pressure of, ""i am in a dire need to do my hair and soon!"" i appreciate that the salon and staff seem to have their regulars' loyalty, from children to teenagers, to middle aged and so on. the atmosphere there is a nice combo between an 80's and 90's, plus some contemporary, playing in the background while the hair masters chat nicely and ask their next costumer what they would like to change or keep about their hair ....i like being there reading my book while my color is settling in, or chat with susan while she flawlessly is back and forth between me and another costumer. thank you susan and team, i will be back! gigi"
susanne cut and colored my hair and she's fabulous. i got nothing but compliments from everyone!
"i wish i could give this place negative 5 stars.  i usually go to michicche salon down the block, but i had to get my kids' hair cut last minute for school pictures and decided to just take them to supercuts this one time since they didn't require an appointment. i figured, how bad can it be? they only need a trim. when we walked in, the place was empty.  that should have given me a clue that i should walk us right back out. there were 2 ""hairdressers"" that were just sitting in the chairs and talking. so one of them takes my son first. i explained to her that she only needed to give him a trim, nothing special. she gets the buzzer out and as soon as she starts to buzz the back of his hair i already know it's not going to go well. she looked like she'd never given a haircut in her life. what he ended up with was something that looked like someone placed a bowl on top of his head and cut around it. my son is very particular about his hair and when he saw what she did to it he looked miserable. i put on my happy face and told him it looked good, but i was fuming. i wanna drop kick the woman at this point. not only did he have the dreaded bowl cut, but it was choppy and uneven. i could have created the monstrosity myself at home, probably would have done better. my daughter is taken next and i'm praying to god that hers turns out different. not! this woman was way worse than the one that cut my son. my daughter's hair was down to the middle of her back and she wanted to have it cut to her shoulders. i asked the woman if she could give her some layers because she has so much hair that it looks really bulky in the back. she proceeds to look at me like i have ten heads, or am speaking a different language. her confusion worries me so i think better of it and tell her to forget the layers. she gets ready to start cutting and looks all sorts of awkward and inexperienced holding the scissors. she didn't even wet her hair. i'm no expert, but i've never had a ""dry"" haircut. i realize there is no hope for this haircut to turn out any different than my son's.  they must have an adverse reaction to evenly cut hair because, like my son, my daughter ended up with her hair being longer on one side. i was fully aware that my kids wouldn't be getting a state of the art haircut at this place because, well, you get what you pay for and all that, but i figured these people would atleast have some basic cutting skills and be able to pull off a damn trim. needless to say, if i ever find myself in a jam again, i will be cutting my kids' hair myself. there is not a chance in hell i could do a worse job than these so called hairdressers. epic fail supercuts. epic fail!"
"shea moved to another salon and the woman who cut my hair this time wasn't as good by a long shot. i didn't wash my hair before going, usually they wash it for me. the woman asks me if i want a wash as well and i tell her yes, i just don't want any shampoo or conditioner used- just water. she doesn't want to do this. instead she tells me to just sit in the chair and she'll spray my hair with some water. my hair isn't clean and this doesn't really work. i ask for layers and a trim. it's simple, but she doesn't spend a lot of time on me before she says she's done. i had asked for ""as many layers as she could fit into my head"" and i barely see any. i show her where to shorten it up and add more, and she does, but she also tells me my hair is too greasy to see the layers. um...no. my hair is greasy, because you refused to wash it for me, but i can still see the haircut. so she finishes and i tell her next time we'll wash it- and i stress with water only- because i'm allergic to many products. she replies, ""that's ok, we have products for sensitive people"". jesus, no, that's not what i said. shea never had a problem just water washing my hair and i don't understand the insistence here, or the implied refusal to wash my hair without products. it's cool, i'm not going to argue with you about it, i'm just going to go somewhere else.after i got home, washed and blowed out my hair i notice a distinct lack of layers. there's one layer in the front, and a longer one in the back. two layers isn't really what i was after and i don't know what else i could have said to get...well, layers. anyway, i hope shea is happy where she is, maybe i'll find her in my search for a new salon."
"i was there for a haircut today. dalia took me right away and asked what i desired. i gave her the exact description of what i wanted. she started the cut, and asked questions along the way to make sure that i got what i wanted. she also offered some advice as far as how i could change my cut. it showed that she cared. my only concern was that she didnt do the hot towel at the end which helps clean up the loose hair. overall: good haircut, decent price, dalia is better than the other stylist that i had previously seen there."
"you pay for what you get.  i was in a complete pinch for a trim so i stopped in. i should have known from the wash - if you can call it that. i was at the sink for maybe 90 seconds. she barely washed my hair, and i swear there was no conditioner.  i had to brush my own hair because she needed to check her facebook.  she asked how much to take off, i showed her. instead of the half inch i showed her, she took off two full inches.  two. full. inches. then she stuck me under the drier so she could cut someone else's hair. for 20 minutes. when i finally got back to the chair, she attempted the worst blowout i've ever had.  i walked out with curly, frizzy pieces of hair in the back, and the front looked plastered to my forehead. when i expressed my disappointment, she dismissed me. i went home to wash and redry my hair. never. again."
"i noticed after i posted this that she cut my hair unevenly. my right side is a good 1/2-1"" longer than my left side. really lame, supercuts."
"they completely botched my eyebrows, half of it is missing! i specifically said not to make them thinner! do not come here!"
"had a great experience! i walked in at seven pm and got a perfect cut and color in under an hour. this place provides great service and extremely reasonable prices unlike other salons in forest hills. the stylist was very friendly and listened to what i wanted, she picked out a great highlighting color for my jet black hair. the blowout was also fast and painless being i have ethnic curly hair which many salons don't know out to properly cut. this place is a must for great affordable service!"
"the barber was friendly, fast and skilled. the location had no lines and the hair cut was exactly what i wanted. only concern is that the price is a little high."
"sue cuts my hair, i don't have to worry about a thing and always get compliments, even from strangers. and the hair snobs cannot believe i go to supercuts. i guess when you find the right haircutter it doesn't matter where they work :)"
"do they have the most skilled stylists? probably not. so if you're a woman who absolutely must have have the perfect haircut, then this place isn't for you. but if you're a guy who just needs a clean cut look every month or so, then this place is perfect. waits are usually not long and prices are reasonable."
"do not go here. i took my 7year old niece for a simple/no frills haircut and it was so uneven that i took her to spectrum to have it fixed right after. i shouldn't have paid or given a tip, but i am not evil. there was an older woman also getting her hair done at the same time and she kept saying her hair was uneven as well. i should have known better. $15 isn't worth it.  walk two stores down and get a quality haircut!"
"i went here to get a quick haircut because my normal stylist was on vacation and i needed to go somewhere nearby.i made an appointment online for a wash & cut. i came in and waited 30 minutes for a pre-made appointment. once i was put in the chair the stylist didn't offer to wash my hair, sloppily put the bib on me and started cutting. now asking me my cut, what i wanted or how short. the woman wouldnt give me her name, presumably because i was visibly annoyed. she cut my hair uneven, 3 inches shorter than i wanted and then asked why i wasn't tipping her.her name is susan. the only reason i know that is because a friend of mine walked in, asked her and walked out.don't waste even $20 there."
ana did exactly what i wanted with my hair. she recommended me the right products. awesome service. thank you ana for my lovely haircut
"i went in for a trim, and i had to let the hairdresser know that she cut my hair completely uneven. but, then again...i shouldn't complain much since it was a $20 haircut."
"i got my haircut by stephanie. i was taken right away, and she discussed with me exactly how i wanted my hair cut. she then proceeded to give me a great detailed haircut. after that, she gave me the hot towel, followed by a shampoo, and styling my hair.she was a good conversationalist, and didn't rush.i encourage all men to get their haircut by stephanie. i certainly will come back to her."
"my wife went here friday evening. she originally called for a blow dry and was quoted $35.she arrives to a rude woman who tells her it will be $48. she asked why the extra charge? to which she came up with nonsense.... since it was friday evening, it was too late to go to anyone else so she stayed. they tortured her hair and did a horrible job. they even had a audacity to ask for a tip!stay away from this crap whole, the other reviewers are correct as well these people are unprofessional, crooks, and completely incompetent!!!!!"
"hi, i gave them another try & found out why i shouldn't have! this is the second time in 2 yrs that they royally messed up the simplest haircut ever. i asked for a classic cut , no layers, angled towards the face with my hair being slightly longer in front than the back. both rose & now anna, couldn't seem to get it right & did the haircut in reverse, with it being shorter in front. she ended up needing to cut a full inch more than what i wanted to 'fix' it. a horror. i'm not sure what to say other than they both admitted to their mistake & looked embarrassed. messing up a woman's hair is a sin. honestly, i'm never going back. be careful how you describe anything to them & ask them to repeat it back before they cut."
"i have only had 1 supercuts experience and it was literally - ok. i had a an appointment for 930am to be in and out - which i was. i was the first and only person in their aside from my stylist, anna. she was bright eyed and ready to go. she was chatty but not annoying. i asked for a very simple cut. i asked for my ends to be trimmed, which they were but not enough was taken off. i dont think i will go back. cheap price but you get what you pay for. 3 stars because i was in and out, price is cheap, and anna was nice."
consistently awful. i came her reluctantly because because we needed to get a cut. i vowed never to go again but came again because my regular hair cutter went mia. several years ago my son got a bad cut by an inexperienced hair cutter who drew blood by clipping my son's ear. so bad. you can just tell the inexperience by the service and lack of confidence by the hair cutters. my son asked for a trim with a bit longer on top and got buzzed on the side and top and the two were poorly blended so that a hard line still shows. my son is so upset he's been in his room sulking all day and vowed not to go to school tomorrow because of the embarrassment. avoid at all costs.
"just wanted to give kudos to rosa at the bell blvd supercuts. i have long wavy hair and rosa took the time to listen to what i wanted and executed the haircut to perfection.  she told me she was going to give me a $100 haircut and she did (of course it really only cost less than $20.00).  she is talented, caring and a true asset to supercuts"
"today christy saved my life. or at least my look. i had gone to a borderline hipster salon in flushing earlier and asked for an edgy asymmetrical pixie cut. i showed them pictures of what i wanted and was careful to use words like ""choppy"" and ""punk"". after two hours of meticulous snipping and very little of letting me see what the heck he was doing, i ended up looking like a sound of music-obsessed soccer mom. that was not what i was going for. i lasted one afternoon before i just couldn't live with this haircut anymore and ran to the nearest hair salon: supercuts. there, i saw christy with her colored locks and covered tattoos and instantly felt hope. she had all the right questions, understood my woes completely and regaled me with entertaining stories of misunderstandings between customers and stylists. in a matter of minutes, she transformed my hair misfortune into a hair miracle. thank you to christy and supercuts on bell!"
came in to get my haircut was approached by anna literally got the worst haircut of my life it looks like a 3 year old gave me a cut dont go here better off going across the street to hair studio 41 for a real barber experience
the place needs to completely replace their staff.  consistently terrible customer service.  hire employees with character and work ethic.  just because you are not the owner or manager does not mean that you can get away with treating paying customers like crap.  fire all of them and replace them.
"the service here is consistently awful. i was worried on my first visit when a customer was arguing with the staff, i should have known to not buy a haircut package then. and even when the staff struggled to use the system that required me to pay $0.53 sales tax on the card it should have been clear to me. today was the last straw when i was quoted a wait of 20 mins, only to be left staring at them when 30 mins passed. and then when it was 45 mins in someone else who came in after me complained and was told they would be next i knew that it was over. i asked when i could expect someone and they all just stared at me. i walked out after an hour. i left my supercuts card. i won't need it ever again, anywhere. why can't i give zero stars?"
"after coming here for the past 10 years (since i was 13) i've decided to take my business elsewhere. call in for an appointment and they still tell you to wait 45 minutes. as for quality of haircut, you just have to get lucky. i can't stay loyal to this place i once loved any longer."
"inez is the worst stylist ever!!!!!!!!!  she ruined my 15 month old sons hair. it was his first haircut and she destroyed his beautiful locks. she never even consulted me how to cut his hair, she just started cutting!!!!! not only is it waaaaayyyyy too short, it's completely uneven!!!!!! thank god he's too little to undergo ridicule from his peers but i feel terrible that i allowed this to happen to him. please take the scissors away from this awful woman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"i did a walk in today at supercuts, and was taken right away. the first lady at the counter was a bit abrupt, but i brushed it off and it was taken over by my stylist. i was the only customer at the time. the girl that did my hair, arianna, was nice and tried to make small talk, but i'm always awkward at talking during my haircut. she was very knowledgeable and gave me her input on what would look better, but still leaving it up to me. i have had many stylists tell me how it should go and that was the only way. i also wanted to get my eyebrows waxed, which arianna also took me back to do. she  seemed to have trouble - tried twice to get under my eyebrow and ripped out the wrong way (she went with the growth, not against). she then went to get another girl (the girl who greeted me originally) who took care of me and did a good job.i usually get my hair done at supercuts - what can i say? i've never had a bad experience and it's good for the price. this supercuts wasn't great, but not bad. they did decent work."
"i preface this by saying i am a black guy...this matters?so a funny thing happened when i went to super cuts on an evening after work, i went in because i was looking for a basic 'take all the hair off'' buzz. there were two women and one asian guy there. as soon as i walked in, the two women walked into the back and when this poor asian guy went to get the person whose turn it was, she actually refused to cut my hair. the asian guy wound up cutting it, he did a reasonable facsimile of a haircut and then proceeded to apologetically  tell me how it was against super cuts policy to use rubbing alcohol on a freshly cut head, they recommended some perfume which would have made me break-out due to my sensitive skin. then there was a full-on summit to decide the price. good news is they didn't over-charge me but that was my first and last time in any super cuts...ever."
my son's long hair was shaved when dad asked to please only trim.  he loved his hair and feels embarrassed and ashamed.  shame on you natasha for doing this to a 6 years old.  beware who cuts your hair!!!!!!!!
had my hair cut there about 2 months ago with arianna. she was very nice and did a great cut and color on my hair.  but i called today and she is no longer with the salon.  anyone have any idea where she went to?
"i've been to other supercuts, this one is by far the worst i've ever been to. i came here one day after work with a friend because my usual hair stylist at a salon was on vacation and i needed my hair done for a night out.i can't even explain how disappointed i was. i showed the girl a picture of the haircut i wanted, explained it in full detail, and i guess she decided she didn't want to do it, so she did something completely different. my bangs were butchered so i had to keep them up in a clip until my girl came back from vacation and could fix them. all she did was complain about how dry my hair was and then insisted i get the deep conditioning, needless to say she didn't sell me on it. and last but not least - what really annoyed me - i asked for my hair to be blow dried and straightened. she dried my hair with a brush and dryer, and then literally took a few pieces of my hair, ran over it real quick with the most out-dated inefficient flat iron i've ever seen (didn't even do my whole head or in layers) and said ""ok!"", complimented herself on such a nice job, and then slapped a nice little fee onto the bill for ""straightening"" my hair. i could've done a better job myself with my iron at home. my friend wanted to get her hair done as well, she had to wait until i was done, and by the time i was, she was so turned off by the way they did my hair that she told them nevermind. some of the staff is very nice, the others have such horrible attitudes. they charge for every little thing, and they overprice for the work that they do.i will never return here again, and believe me i have not recommended this place since my visit, nor will i in the future. i'd trust my 10 year old niece to do my hair before i come here again."
a $15.99 haircut is now $18.00 - everyone who worked there left - they won't honor coupons from corporate - you make an appointment and show up and they don't have your appointment.  it's a major disappointment - it will just be a matter of time before they have to shut down because no one will want to go there any longer.
"i have a great experience every time i come with my kids people are super nice and friendly! but we love rosalva she's super sweet and always makes sure we're happy with our haircuts, totally recommend her!"
hiwhat an experience at this locationi went here with my sonwe say hello and nobody reply back wow i am looking i went to counter this guy pointed at flat screen okfirst they try to make me give info and i refused it was first last phone and email to much info i respectfully decline and one of the lady's with glasses looked at me with the greatest discuss i have ever seen my son got his hair cut to short my hare dresser was asking me every second can i cut this can i cut that and the lady with glasses swept my feet and doesn't say sorry i was not comfortable or delighted customer service is dead herei will not return sorry
"i had been visiting another supercuts location, when my go to dresser retired. so i had to start over again...well carleen is fantastic! i visited on a saturday 6/17 and the place was moving despite the rain. she's definitely a doll, listened and got it right. i have medium length hair and needed to clean up my split ends in layers with a face frame trim and she nailed it! can't be happier..thank you carleen! i will definitely be back again."
"i go to this location even though it's not the closest one to me.  rosalva has been amazing....very nice, professional and gives really good haircuts."
this place should be ashamed to call itself a business. my mother in law who is in her 80's went in for a trim and they took off 5 inches and had the balls to charge her.  what happened to listening to your customers.  stay away go some place else.  do not waste your money
"this places surpassed all of my expectations .  i called in first and explained that i needed a very bad haircut fixed . i wasn't specific enough that i needed a wash, cut , blow dry but was accomodated anyway. carleen was the fastest, most efficient hairdresser i have ever met. she took me from wash to cut/dry in under 40 minutes. most importantly , she completly fixed my bad haircut.  this was a huge undertaking, as i had uneven layers all over my head . the only way to fix everything was to cut the hair until it was one even length . voila ! it was done quickly and for 35.00. i cannot thank this salon enough for giving me my hair back ."
"i usually go there every two weeks. i tend to get a different stylist everytime. however, that is going to change. when i came in i was warmly greeted by rosalva. i was then seated, and she began to cut my hair. she understood exactly what i wanted. before i knew it i was all finished. rosalva is now the only person to cut my hair in supercuts. great quality , and care is the soul reason why i will be coming back! thank you rosalva."
very disappointed with my experience at supercuts today.  i was met by two individuals who didn't seem that knowledgable about hair - and really didn't seem to care either.  one was openly eating her lunch in front of customers and was not very professional at check-in.  they advised me on the total price of my various styling choices with calculator in hand like i couldn't afford them and were just making sure i could pony up the cash at the end of the visit.  i don't think i was ever treated like that before and it was very unprofessional to say the least.  i ended up leaving with a sub-par style.  i used to go here a lot - decided to visit again today - but it most certainly is my last visit.
amazing haircut !! short wait.   normally i go to a very expensive salon. i ran in here on whim in desperate need of a cut because i couldn't get into my salon and saw rich.  i haven't been back to my salon since !!!
"had my hair cut by rosy gomez today. i told her i wanted a two in trim and to clean up my long layers. she ended up cutting a very thick choppy layer that was as short as my chin!i usually get haircuts in nyc that are about $100+, but decided a trim in between actual hair appointment couldn't go wrong....wrong! two other women had to come over to help when she realized she messed up. beware, this is where good hair goes to die."
"terrible haircut by rosalva. she asked me if i prefer clippers or scissors. i could have done it with clippers at home if i'm paying of course i want scissors. so she started cutting my hair. i wasn't happy with the length. she was nice to shorten it, but when the number of customers waiting are increased at 5 pm on sunday with two stylist (or just haircutter) she panicked a little bit. when she was done it was totally unsymmetrical. i told her and she said you are right and did couple of more scissor cuts and still same. people were waiting i said forget about it and left. i shouldn't give her any dime but left a good tip.so i came home i did my hair clippers symmetrical! when i was young i had accidents using the clippers and was running to the barbershop to fix it. now i go to supercuts, pay for the haircut and running to home to fix it! ridiculous. i want my money back!"
"i used to come to this place ever month for about a year, not anymore. last time i was here i decided never to go back. price is very good but the way they cut my hair just wasn't doing it. i asked her to use only scissors and she agreed to it, but ad the end she ended up cutting my hair with a machine. i would rather pay more and get a better hair cut."
"i feel like this place should be way more popular! i usually have terrible experiences going to other chains, but this supercuts has great stylists at awesome prices. today they were swamped but the girl taking care of me took her time and didn't half ass her job. she went out of her way to great clients as they walked in and would excuse herself when the phone rang -- she did a hell of a job being by herself. great place -- definitely worth it and the place to get a trim."
"i've been coming here for about a year. carleen is the best ever, very attentive, friendly and professional.  i won't let anyone else touch my roots.  so happy to have found her, keep up the great work."
i love this place !!!!! best haircut.   see rich!!!.  you will not be disappointed.   expensive haircut for cheap !!!
i have been coming to supercuts in edgewater for over a year to get 2 weekly blowouts. i've seen this salon decline in every way in the last 2 months. i have decided not to come back and these are my reasons. there is only 1 person there from opening until 11 am during the week so getting my blowout in the morning became a problem. i would watch 3-5 people walk in and walk out because of the wait times or no one available. this salon is losing a lot of customers for being understaffed and not with qualified people. how rude is it that you arrive for your appointment and as you are getting ready to sit to be washed someone else walks in and your told sorry i must take walk in haircuts before an appt for a blow out?? i'm left sitting there an extra 15-20 minutes until they are done plus the time it takes to get my hair done. that's unheard of for any salon to treat their clients with such disregard. another time i called about 6 times between 9 am - 10 am to get no answer. that was strange since the salon opens at 9:00 am. when i get there almost 10:30 am rich the manager was there by himself. i said why didn't anyone answer the phone. i was trying to call to come in. he said with an attitude it's only me here and i'm too busy to answer the phone. i had to come back at 12:00 pm if i wanted my blowout done. if your unprofessional with an attitude people will simply go elsewhere near by. i was also told by the manager last week he is raising prices on many of the services. i said why would anyone come to supercuts if your now charging more than a full service salon? he said it's nothing personal whether i liked it or not. if big changes for the better do not happen this salon is and is already losing a major amount of business by having these manager and scheduling problems. i never had any issues prior to these changes and enjoyed coming to my weekly appointments with carlina and rosey. they do the best blowouts and that's why i chose to keep coming here over a year now. i had my last straw with this place and had to find another salon to do my hair every week. my review is don't even waste your time coming there. for those prices go to a full service salon by appointment.
"looking for rude, unprofessional staff, wait times of over an hour and a staff turnaround that makes even fox news look stable? look no further than the supercuts in edgewater, nj. as an added bonus, the staff (like rosalva) will skip you over their ""favorite customers"" regardless of how long you've been waiting there. don't waste your time here. plenty of better options in the area like the sportsclips down the road for a comparable price."
nice environment. i like the computer check-in process. the service was great and very friendly staff. he gave me a good haircut!
went for a blowout before a last minute night out. they suggested a quick haircut and it was much needed. ..dead ends gone and blowout looked great!!  also lasted several days! will definitely be going back
"they asked $43 for my 7 yrs old daughter hair, just for shampoo and flat iron!!!!!be aware!!! they have no idea what they are talking about.i left the store, went to ulta they did shampoo + hair cut + blow dry with much more experienced service and paid only $22."
"check in online before going to the salon for a much reduced wait time. i got a layered haircut for $20, added a $4 off coupon i got for signing up for the supercuts mailing list online (be sure to do this well in advance, the coupon takes more than an hour to be emailed).  it's very clean inside with friendly staff. the salon is actually up the set of stairs of building 108, it's on the second floor to the right. the haircut was just what i needed, really unless you're getting an insanely complicated haircut it doesn't make sense to pay the price of a normal salon. supercuts is much more reasonable in price and is very good quality!"
"i have had good experiences here in the past, but the last time i was here it felt and looked like the hairstylist was a child cutting their doll's hair. she did not listen to what i wanted and then went ahead and gave me god-awful short layers. i never asked for layers and when i saw her chopping away, i asked if that was what she was doing, creating layers. i then decide, and told she, fine, layers, but only if they are short.my stylist was stubborn and when i drew attention to her not even parting my hair the way i normally wear it, she ignored it. she only did so at the end when cutting my bangs. again, it's the luck of the draw when you come here. i should have asked to see one of the women whom i had before who was good. unfortunately the one i found to be fantastic has probably, and rightfully so, moved on to a better salon. as for now, i'm going to pay the same amount i paid here for a haircut just to get a bang trim. eve that was too difficult for her. i can't entirely fix this haircut because the layers are ridiculously short, forcing me to wait a few months.i'd also like to add that my stylist was way more interested in gossip about the salon than her task."
"i made a huge mistake going to supercuts. this person was inexperienced and very unsure of herself. she keep asking me for directions including what scissors to use. she used very dull layering shears that kept crimping my hair. the worst part,  she started layering an inch away from my scalp result in the ridiculousness pictured here. i was clear i did not want bangs, and she lobbed off a huge chunk of hair on the right side of my face. appalling."
"i wish i could give this place zero stars. i made an online suggested appointment for 745. i walked in around 735 and was barely acknowledged. one of the hairdressers who i assume was the owner had finished cutting her persons hair a little before 8, she then proceeded to take 20 minutes to ring them up to pay. afterward she chatted with them and made phone calls instead of helping me. i waited until 830 before i finally walked out. i am absolutely disgusted by their professionalism. i was not acknowledged even once while i was sitting their for over 45minutes. thy should learn how to treat customers. absolutely disgusted by them! will absolutely never go back."
i started going to the montague st. supercuts because of the very long wait time at  university place.  i am so very happy i changed location.   i love donna.  i have seen her 3 times and she has given me a fabulous cut each time.    i will definitely be going back.     thank you donna.
"had a great experience with donna. she gave me a wash and blow dry. my hair came out much more gorgeous than i expected. she is super talented and sweet. will come back again! 5 stars!i came back, emma a manager , seems to be having a very bad day. she had a harsh attitude in her tone towards me and another customer. 3 stars."
"gemma was extremely rude to my sister when she walked in to get a haircut. she sat down and immediately gemma started criticizing my sisters hair and implying that she did not want to cut my sisters hair. my sister finally got uncomfortable and left, gemma seemed pleased by this. don't go here, they lost two customers in the span of 3 minutes."
"5 stars !!! a hidden gem ! had an outstanding haircut with nina today!!! i have very fine medium length hair which is hard to grow long without lots of special care and treatment. pair that with my [prior] dislike for actually getting a haircut and you have some seriously split ends! i finally caved in and decided to get it trimmed after work today. it had been about 1.5 years since my last cut and it was noticeably crispy at the bottom (yea, not a word you'd want to use to describe hair) !this was the best haircut i've had! the actual haircut/trim (not including the consultation), took about 5 mins and i could tell and even more so, feel the difference immediately. nina really respected my wishes for the appointment and is very trustworthy if you're worried about too much hair going missing lol.  i'm a wash and go type, so this was absolutely perfect for my personality -my ideal haircut is no more than 10 mins and pretty much in and out. my hair is also easy to cut because of the texture/light weight. i'm sure if you wanted a more styled cut, and lots of time taken, that nina would also be good for you. i just want to emphasize that my haircut wasn't rushed at all- it was exactly what i wanted. the ability to understand the client well and respect their needs is a true gift that nina has in spades. i've been to several high end salons & spas, aveda salons, and four different supercuts locations besides this one, but i've never felt as comfortable or been as happy ! there was no wait time, the salon is easy to find and very clean. also seems child friendly. i will absolutely be back, i've already recommend nina to two of my friends, and having such a positive experience really changed the way i see getting a haircut :)"
"horrible! i went there thinking that nothing could go wrong since i only wanted a simple layered bob. i was so wrong!! i am irritated and shocked that this woman has a license to cut hair. she butchered my hair,it looked like a 5 year old did it. before i left the salon,i knew it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. but when i left and really took a good look,everything was un even!! i took some of the photos of my poor hair. i didn't make a scene at the salon because i am not the type of person who does that,i really thought i could grow it out and wait for another haircut. it was horrendous that i had to fix it at the same day at another salon. i don't know who did my hair because she didn't introduce herself. she had curly hair and that's all i know. do yourself a favor and do not go to this salon!! they will ruin your hair!"
"i came in for a haircut and specified that i would not  like my shoulder-length hair to be cut short: i wanted only a trim and a haircut that mostly shaped my existing haircut.  i was asked to remove my glasses which meant i could not see what was going on.  when kamla was done, i had a super- short cut and even though it was not bad as haircuts go,  i was shocked and quite unhappy.  i will return to gemma next time."
"be prepared to wait, even if you have an appointment. the app the company uses needs to be improved.gemma is wonderful at what she does. she has been in the business for countless years. hair stylists are good at what they do, and listen. super cuts is for an affordable hair cut.if you are a man, great. they will take you before anyone else - even if you have an appointment."
i got an outstanding cut and color by jeff today after work! i had great conversations and walked away reinvention! highly recommend!!
"i've been back a couple of times now, including getting a trim by nina as well as a trim a few months ago by another woman.  i have no idea what happened to tony but so far there have been no mishaps with my trims.  i've never gotten my hair washed or blown out at supercuts, just trimmed which is fine for $18.76 + tip."
i went here once. i got a trim. she cut my hair uneven. next haircut i got they had to fix it. never will use supercuts again. you get what you pay for when it comes to haircuts usually. i learned that the hard way.
"just got a wash and cut from rosie, she is such a nice and sweet person and an awsome hairdresser. i am soo hooked with her. loved the cut and she gave me tips to soft my hair. i am gonna be a regular here from now on... ask for rosie she is best."
"excellent service at a reasonable price. i typically pay 70 dollars to get my hair cut, but i need to start budgeting now and can unfortunately no longer afford to go to my favorite salon. i was very satisfied not only with the service, but with the quality hair cut that i received from this salon. i will definitely be returning!"
was one of the finest experiences i had. got my hair done in $20 and the service which was provided to me was really great. would surely recommend this to a friend of mine.
"donna gave me the best blowout and was quick, friendly and professional.  intend to go back for cut and color."
"alainya was great! i have very long hair and getting a hair cut stresses me out. i explained what i wanted, she repeated to me and explained in detail, and did a great job. i will definitely be back!"
"i was really skeptical about going here since i hadn't been since i was a child, haha, but being on a budget you have limited options in nyc. i have long curly hair and not everyone knows how to cut it properly without making me look ridiculous. however nina did the greatest job! i am in love with how it looks now!! definitely will be going back to her from now on. everything from booking the appointment to the price everything was such a great experience."
"i had pretty much given up on getting my hair colored in salons since no one seemed to be able do it right. tony suggested a red violet brown and my hair looks beautiful! in addition to being a true professional, he is also a great friendly guy to spend a couple of hours with."
sad that at 20 minutes before closing they lock the door. wanted to buy some product but sweeping girl flat out ignored me.  lost a customer in me - plenty of other places to go
just went in today as a walk in and was very well taken care of.  i was just looking for a place where i could go on my lunch break but i was also tired of the high prices of other places.  i am happy i was able find both.  chelsea was my stylist and did a great job.  she took time to listen to what i want to have done.  all the great reviews of her here on yelp are well deserved.  i'm glad i'm not the only one.  definitely an asset for the salon.  great prices and great service.  looking forward to going back next month.
i don't think i'll be taking my son back here. i could have done a better job myself. my son was there last week for a cut and i said to keep it long without layers. the girl was very nice that cut his hair but the more i look at it the more it pisses me off. it's hair and will grow back but the girl needs additional training. it's unacceptable!
"chelsea was my stylist and she was great!  i was a bit apprehensive because i hadn't had my hair cut in sometime and it was a bit straggly looking.  she cut about 2"" and gave me a nice blow out.  she also answered my questions about how to cover my grays.  service was immediate and prompt.  i will be back to see chelsea so she can cover my grays and give me a conditioning treatment.  price is right.  this location may be hard to find.  its directly behind the strip mall that houses shoe carnival, gap outlet, five below, etc.  supercuts faces the acme."
chelsea did a wonderful wash and blow dry on me. she's very meticulous and cheerful which leads me to always come back to her. her attention to detail is amazing. conversation is always great and she makes me feel comfortable and at ease while sitting in her chair. i'm not a fan of chain salons but i'll always make sure i get my cut and blow dry with chelsea!
"i stopped in yesterday, 7/19/15,  to get a haircut. everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating. did not have to wait at all. christina gave me an awesome cut that i really love! i definitely recommend her, she gave me exactly the cut and style i was looking to achieve:)"
"this is a beautiful shop.  the girls are all very nice.  chrystal gave me a great haircut and the prices are so reasonable.  i go to supercuts every time i need my hair done, but this is my first visit to this location. very nice."
hit or miss place. the newer stylists haven't been fully trained. i leave with chunks of long hair. at times i end up getting good cuts.
the prices are standard...i got what i asked for and was pleased with the result. when i came in there was only one worker there so i gave a four star review because of the wait. the worker did a good job but they need people at the reception to take calls and checkout those that at finished.
"greeted nicely by all stylists when i arrived. checked in and was taken quickly (only a few people were waiting). ashley gave me a wash, cut, and blow dry and did an excellent job. i have long thick curly hair and i wear it straight. she spent all the time needed in blow drying it straight with an awesome curl/wave at the ends. this was my first time to supercuts and i would return to ashley again.  the atmosphere was quiet but welcoming and friendly. the only reason i wouldn't give it a 5-star has more to do with the actual aesthetics of the salon. the carpet is worn as are the seats in the waiting room. i have been to a couple other similar salons in the area (master cuts, great cuts, hair cuttery, etc) and they are all a lot ""nicer"" to be in while waiting. that being said - i would rather sit in a shabbier spot and get a great haircut than wait in a brand new shiny place and leave unhappy!!!"
"due to a poor vacation over sight  a simple knot in the back of my hair became a complete crown of a matted mess. i bought every detangling product on the planet worsening the situation. i allowed this problem to fester for three weeks! as my hair is about almost two feet long as i am growing it out to get married in two months. all of it stood like a cone on top of my head. i was doomed. my mother, a dog groomer, said i had no choice but to cut it out. i was terrified my groom and i would have the same hairstyle for the wedding. i called to make an appointment with complete embarrassment and was met with encouragement they would try to salvage as much hair as possible. upon arrival i was greeted with a warm welcome from a women named jess w. who explained in detail every avenue she would take to help. customers in the salon we're in shock at my hair. i was heartbroken by the customers face because i knew they would cut off my hair. jess laid her hand on my shoulder and said let's get started we're going to be here awhile because we're not cutting anything. we spent the next 2.5 hours together. she reinforced there was nothing to be embarrassed about. held conversations as if we were best friends all while hiding any symptom of fatigue in her hand or back. she did it to make me feel comfortable. that gesture alone awed me. well truth be told she never took her scissors out!  she made a miracle happen. after the last knot was brushed she did not say were done. she leaned over and said i'm going to give you the best shampoo you have ever had. in deed it was. she even offered to throw my hair in braids so it would not knot over night. i plan to make this my only destination for hair beauty. if you can request your consult. request jess w you will not be disappointed. she's a miracle worker"
i had an appointment on a sunday afternoon with tina for a cut & color. i was taken back a few mins after i arrived. the staff greeted me warmly as i entered. tina took the time to talk to me about what i wanted done and discussed my color with me. i walked out extremely satisfied and pleased with my cut and color.  i will definitely be returning. tina is an amazing stylist and extremely professional.
"so i checked in online and it said no wait. i get to the salon and there are two ladies being serviced. i get no acknowledgement from any employees and am ignored for now going on 35 minutes. i'm about to walk out. this is absolutely the worst supercuts i've ever been to and management needs to be replaced as i've seen i'm not the only one who has these feelings.  in addition, the app serves no purpose as i had to check in again when i arrived."
so i am here now and have been waiting to get my haircut for about 25 mins. i checked in at the kiosk but the staff has not given me even 1 update about when i will get called up.  in addition people have been coming in based on earlier reservations made.  so...do people who walk in keep getting bumped back like those trying to fly standby?  the staff doesn't seem very friendly or approachable either. will update this after i finally get a haircut.
"i've gone to this particular supercuts for the last year. the stylists are all pleasant and personable and i always have a good cut. they definitely know what they're doing.that said, the management of this particular establishment is pretty dismal. on a few occasions there haven't been enough workers to cope with the clientele load and there are frequent walk outs which cuts my wait time but you'd think they'd be able to maximize service by having at least 3 working at any given time.the computer check in system should be able to tell the timing and walk out rate and they could tailor schedules to the metrics. but i guess that's just me."
"consistently customer focused with great quality.  i have been coming here since 2006 (nearly 9 years). i am really happy with the prices and how they do my cut and color.  they are pleasant, friendly, and customer focused.  a tip:  they are not very organized at filing the color cards.  my last name is often misspelled and hard to find, takes a little extra time.  a couple times, my card was never found during the last year.  you would think this would be a problem for me, but it isn't.  the staff is so good at what they do that they can talk to me, look at me, and then....i get a color i like better than the last one.  so if they lose your card, don't worry!"
"went there and got my sons hair cut. it came out really nice, she did it exactly how i wanted it!  also i got my eyebrows waxed...  the lady did a very nice job as well! she is the second lady that i would now trust to do them!   i would go back there again"
"my son had a bit of a haircut emergency at 8:20 on a tuesday night. i called 3 hair cuttery's and all of which answered the phone as if i bothered them and were closed or closing even though it said 9:00 online. i called super cuts. they answered the phone pleasantly and assured me they do not close until closing time. they take their ""last customer"" at 9:00. they sounded as if they would appreciate my business and now i'm happy to give it to them.the stylist was evelyn. thanks evelyn!"
"i wanted to give a shout-out to tara at this location. yesterday i had gotten my hair colored and cut with my stylist in king of prussia (who i'd been going to for well over a year without incident). for some reason that stylist went rogue on me and f'ed up my color and cut. i am leaving the country in several days and didn't want to be seen looking the way i did. first thing this a.m. i went to this villanova location as a hail mary to see if something could be done last-minute before i left town. tara assessed the damage and offered up solutions. my hair was so brassy and over-highlighted that the toner wasn't quite doing the trick to tone it down. tara stuck with it and my highlights look so good and blend with my base color so much better!! i appreciated her attention to detail and care in making sure she did all she could. next, she corrected the weird haircut i had received - my stylist likes to use the razor blade to create layers vs. cutting them in with scissors. for my hair type it just looks too choppy and isn't blended well at all. tara got to work fixing that hot mess.so, at the end of my supercut visit, tara greatly improved my hair color so that i'm no longer embarrassed walking down the street and my kids can no longer make fun of me - plus i no longer look like chunks of gum were cut out of my hair!! phew. such a relief to walk out the door feeling confident about how my hair looks! thank you, thank you, tara!"
i'm not going to give this more than a single star. i live not far from this location. so other than convenient - that's it. the staff is very rude. they discourage people from waiting and exaggerate the wait times. i've witnessed it nearly every time. also - the place is filthy.!!!! every time i've gone i noticed a rash on my arms and neck  from the chairs. they don't sanitize their instruments or wipe down the chairs and there are piles of brushes around the damp sink. it's really gross. i'm not sure they even wash the robes. it's really unpleasant. never ever  again.
"this is the place to go!from the get go, as i entered in everyone greeted me with a smile and just the overall vibe of the store was inviting. i was checked-in and had very little wait time and was immediately seen by my 'stylist' of choice (trish). fyi - there are multiple ways to get check-in as they have the mobile app, or direct call-ins that you can do to schedule an appointment as well as they take direct walk-ins. everyone has a horror story or two about getting their hair cut and having someone try to do what they would like when getting their haircut. i have quite a few and as i have been trying to find a stylist who not only knows what she's doing but has great customer service for the past 4-5 years... and i finally did! trish is a gem i found! even though hair grows back and mess-ups can be fixed this way, trish is someone that always has made me not worry about my look or cut, but also someone who i trust. now, i get my money's worth and not always having an issue month to month with my dew.i recommend this supercuts location. i also recommend seeking trish if you're looking for great customer service and a great finished haircut everytime. after my recent visit, i noticed that all the other customers were satisfied with their stylist as well - so you can't go wrong here.from what i discovered, this is a new supercuts location that popped up in the villanova area. not only is everything just clean, new and updated compared to other locations - it has a nice inviting set up to really just give that local barbershop/hair salon feel. it's all topped off with great workers/stylists that just make the place inviting... go check it out!!"
"my two little kids got great haircuts here from gracie. they are both a little nervous and not very excited about haircuts. they came in with long faces clinging to my leg but ran out skipping and laughing, just like that scene in naked gun when the couple comes out of the movie theater after watching platoon. overall the haircut was great and gracie was extremely nice and accommodating! we will be back!"
"since opening, this is where i get my hair cut because it is the closest to my home. i am not that particular when it comes to my hair, and will always allow whichever stylist is available to perform my generic male haircut. the last two haircuts i received were awful. bad to the point of going to a competitor for a ""fix"". needless to say i think i have given up on this supercuts."
another great experience at super cuts. friendly accommodating staff who are happy to be working there.
"i've been going to supercuts for well over a decade and to the drexel location for perhaps 3yrs. i have never been disappointed in the service and the prices remain more than reasonable. today, however, the staff were especially accommodating and were friendly as could be. they really brightened what was shaping up to be a rather unpleasant and frustrating day...and i got a great cut to boot (per usual). my regret is that i am unable to recall my stylist's name so as to thank her personally. i will continue to patronise supercuts at drexel for as long as i'm in this area and will be sure to recommend it to any and all. thanks, guys!"
"been here three (maybe four) times for quick trims since they opened, but my most recent visit will be my last. i realize that i am a much more ""mature"" client than this location typically sees, and i have had very short hair for 35 years now so there are not a lot of styling options. when i went in, i explained that i just wanted a trim and, if possible, some shaping to take out some of the ""bulk"" of my thick, wavy hair. i showed the stylist two pictures of haircuts i liked. we talked about how the stylist felt both my style and my color were aging me. i agreed and said i hoped a little shaping would help and i trusted her, because after all - hair grows back. (it was a joke!!)i was asked if i minded if she used clippers in the back. i said no, i didn't mind because most past stylists used them on the edges in back and on my neck - i have a low hairline. then i felt the clippers going straight up the back of head....over and over again. and i felt the scissors going across the back of my head....higher and higher. at this point i said something lame like ""that feels awfully short"" and the response was ""it'll grow back."" i was asked if i wanted the length on my bangs cut. i said no - i just wanted them textured to be wispier. she agreed... and then cut them to be about 1/2 inch long. needless to say: i am horrified to report that i look like i was attacked by a weedwacker. yes it will grow back eventually....but with a few tears and lots of embarrassment in the meantime."
"i got a really bad haircut from here. the layering was uneven and i got short layers even though i specifically asked for long layers. the layers in the back are 3+ in shorter. also, the cut is very blunt. they gave me a refund because they know they messed up. i have to go get it fixed now but i will definitely never go back here."
"three stars? are you serious? this place is a definite 5 star establishment. the staff was fun, friendly, and helpful. my stylist, jasmyn, not only gave me the best fade and trim i've had in years, but also great conversation about cosplay, her new line of all natural hair products, and just life lol. don't pay attention to all the negative reviews and book your next appointment here!"
i had been wanting to find a new place in philly and usually i try to find high end places but i decided to try it out and i was very pleased. i didnt get my hair cut but i got a partial with a red and purple color done. jessie was amazing and they didnt have the first colors for me first time around but i went a second time and she redid the color on the house and i was super appreciative of it! i'll definitely be seeing her for future hair appointments:)
"this was my first time at a supercuts in philly, as i usually go to south philly salon, but, i was in the neighborhood and not available on my usual day, so, i decided to try it. as soon as i arrived, they instructed me to sign in (online) . i had one person ahead of me, so, wait time was less than 5 minutes. the stylist, was friendly, professional and cut my hair precisely how i asked. i asked after cut, if i used correct terminology, and she replied ""yes"".. i will come back if i am crunched for time and cannot make it to my south philly salon. the haircut didn't take long and it looks good. thanks."
"i have very curly hair and i've been trying to find a good, cheap haircutting spot for the longest- i finally found it. vernessa really listened to everything i asked for and even gave some curly tips for me to use, she knows how to cut curls! for all the curly headed girls that don't wanna spend 250$+, for 25$ this is honestly a deal, i'll def be coming back again !"
"don't go here, this is the worst haircut i have ever had.  this place is enticing because it is so reasonably priced but they will make you look stupid.  i had bangs and i wanted them to be a little more full, the staff just chopped a thick piece of my hair without consideration.  she looked aghast when she looked at me, she knew she effed up my bangs.  honestly, if it came down to supercuts or shears in the bathroom... i would take my chances with the shears, and i have no experience at all.  booo!"
"honestly one of the worst haircuts i've ever gotten. i got the girl in the front seat to the left on a slow saturday afternoon. she rushed through my haircut and didn't bother cleaning up the back (usually a decent barber would ask a man if they want the back..rounded or square) when i asked her to clean up my neckline, she gave a condescending attitude as if i asked her to glue my hair on and start again."
"the staff here is all very friendly. that being said, no one cares if you have a nice hairdresser when you have a rough hair cut.  it wasn't even that he cut it too short (which he did) it just seemed like such a scraggle-y technique. i know during other haircuts they have a way they cut it so it doesn't have a blunt looking cut, but this was like that in a very chunky, unnatural looking way.for $20 plus tip, next time i'll  be going somewhere better with a groupon promo or something, little better quality."
"venssa is the best, she is a professional and so friendly. i came with an orange hair after bleaching she fixed it. so glad with the result.i just gave 4 stars for the entire stuff but venessa deserves more than 5"
"after hearing and reading so many positive reviews about this place, i just had to give it a try. the staffs are nice people and i felt like i can come here for all my future hair cuts, but it turns out to be the top worst place that i've ever gone to. i had long hair and asked for a new look, specifically the type of hair i mentioned, and in the end the barber only spent about 10 minutes cutting and trimming my hair. the results  shocked me and left me feeling embarrassed walking outside back to my room. i could get a way better haircut in connecticut, and for cheaper, if i was back home. before, i have heard of the guy, by the name of kevin, from most reviews, and that he is best barber to go to, but unfortunately i went with someone else. i am now stuck with this awful haircut that could not be fixed. because of my first bad experience here, i will never plan on coming back here again and recommend that everyone should find a better supercuts or a new place to go."
"okay okay excuse my ""elite yelper b#%^ syndrome"" from the last review.  this time i went back again, sarah was amazing!!!! she took her time with trimming my hair and did a great job. kevin and sarah were so friendly and attentive with the guests who were waiting. honestly when you have one bad experience with a staff doesn't mean that the whole team is not satisfying. ladies. please request sarah when you go in!!! !!"
"i have been here twice in the past 6 weeks. supercuts is comically known to my friends as the ""fast food"" of haircuts as they are usually inexpensive and quick. i don't mind this business model and find it useful when you are in a rush. i have read the reviews about this location and agree with the former customers. the employees here do not seem to cut hair that well. they got me in and out quicker than most other supercuts franchises i have been to and pretty much did a superpar job. i dont understand why they don't wash your hair like other franchises as well. i hope next time i go i dont feel like i am being rushed out in such a short time, especially when no one is waiting for a haircut"
"its not about the prices , its about the process. right now it is sat morning more then 14 people waiting and 1 barber!! this is upsetting and very unpromising when advertised quick and qualitative. im sure the manager will reply oh i am sorry about the experience from what i see its a lack of leadership and team effort. she even forgot to sign me in and still intended to call people before me !!! this is a joke ...... and last time i have posted this on fb until this process changes i will withdraw my comment"
"kevin the manager is here! i loved him in wynnewood, i am so happy to know that i can still get my hair blown out by the best!"
great experience and an amazing cut. finally supercuts is on campus. thanks melissa! you're awesome.
"ok, here is the thing, my hair is hard and thick, but it can't be the reason for you to stretch my scalp with your sharp clip! and also, the details are super terrible! i wouldn't hate you for the awful haircut, but please! practice more!"
"kevin did a great job on my hair, blow dried it, and made it look fabulous! deforest will be using them for mine and my husband's hair cuts. quality haircuts for a great value. thanks kevin!"
"never written a yelp review before, but this is the worst haircut i've ever received. asked for half my current length and the stylist took that to mean an eighth as long, and, in order to make it look less wrong, trimmed the sides shorter. unfortunately, this wasn't even and so now i have hair wings on my sides like a mediocre pegasus. matching this pegasus look, she left several ""horse tails"" on the back of my head (at the original length), which i had to pull out. bad."
"stopped in without an appointment to get my face cleaned up. they were able to accommodate me, and i left out with a nice even beard trim."
i just moved to philly and i was trying to find an inexpensive barber to just get a simple cut and supercuts was the only barber that was under $20 (it is $18 for just a cut). i went and the people were friendly and got me setup. within a minute or two i was in the chair and a stylist was asking me what i wanted. i don't recall the stylists name but she was young and probably very new because she didn't seem to understand how rough she was being with the razor. about halfway through my cut she poked me with the scissors which was more annoying than painful but is part of the reason i can't give 5 stars. overall the price was okay if a bit on the expensive side compared to what i am used to and the atmosphere and attitude of the stylists was great but the actual cut was rough even though it ended up looking good in the end.
"this review is regarding my hair cut and what i would consider an unethical practice...i have been to this location several times, however i will not be returning to this location. while waiting to be seated the stylist helping me was finishing up with another client. at the end of the cut i saw her grab an instagram/ facebook picture frame. she held this up so the clients face was in the frame, and quickly grabbed her phone to take a picture. i could see the client in the chair was confused about what was happening. he had no clue what she was holding up because she did not turn it to make it visible, nor did she tell him or ask him if she could or wanted to take a picture. at the end of my hair cut she tried to do the same thing, however i quickly stopped her as she grabbed her phone. again she did not ask permission or indicate her intentions. on top of this i asked for finger length on the top however the stylist should have told me that she has very small fingers because it turned out to more look like i had a full out buzz cut. i just left from a supercuts near my work. i told the stylist about my last experience, how she cut my hair extremely short and about the instagram/facebook photo frame situation. the stylist was in shock when i told her about the pictures because she explained that this was for a contest. the store that could rack up the most pictures of their clients with the frame would win a prize, and a day they could wear jeans into work. she also told me that all of the photos taken were published on facebook. to top it off this location won the contest.your location won the contest taking photos of your customers without their consent or knowledge that the pictures would be published to facebook."
"i had to wait for my daughter to come out of a concert on south, and i tried this salon while i was waiting.  they had a special running for hair dye, and i figured, why not?  i have nothing but time!  cut and color for 35.00, can't beat it. trish is the girl that i was put with, she was so nice!  i've never had my hair colored (and i'm 45), i usually do it myself...but for the price, i couldn't turn it down.  trish was fast and thorough!  i was nervous because there were a bunch of men that kept coming in for cuts, and i wondered if they were any good on women's cuts.  she cut my hair and even razored the ends!  love it!  she was fast and did an excellent job on my locks....i didn't wash my hair for three days because i loved how she styled it. i wish i lived closer to this salon because i'd go every 6 weeks !  thank you trish!"
terrible haircut. uneven all over and styled similar to lloyd's in dumb & dumber. avoid.
"i've gone twice to this supercuts. the staff aren't particularly friendly. the first time was fine, i just got a trim and it was more or less what i wanted. the second time i went back it seemed like the stylist didn't know what she was doing. i told her i just wanted to trim off the dead ends. she cut more than enough off and though i asked her for layers, i got all one length and it looks terrible. i will definitely not being going back here."
"terrible!  i went for a blow out and style which i asked them to curl it- it was awful- i had to go home and redo it myself. i thought something so basic would be easy but i was wrong. on top of it, they were super unfriendly!!  it's s shame because i try to give these chains the benefit of the doubt, but i will not be going back...just goes to show if you need even a basic service to go to a real salon. stay away!"
"i usually give these guys the benefit of the doubt and it's pretty cheap but the last few times i've gone there, they've really messed up my hair, and i wear a very simple style (and takes about 15 mins). it seem more lack of care and willingness to provide extra effort with some of their new hires. will be looking for other options in the area"
"before i moved out of queen village, i would stop by this supercuts on occasion for affordable waxing and impromptu trims if i were too impatient to wait for someone at work to do it.  they earn back one star for the stylists i ended up seeing there, whom i would recommend and go back to if the opportunity presented itself.  i have gotten waxing done by trish a few times--she is thorough, gentle, and friendly.  as i was checking out after an appointment with her, i made conversation with another stylist, tim, whose style i really liked, so i figured i would ask for him on my next visit.  that i did, and he was fun to chat with and did an awesome job on my hair! i also saw him for waxing once and he is great with that as well.  on that note, should you visit this location, make sure you request trish or tim!"
i just read a negative review on this site about brandi & i was floored. i'm guessing there was another reason for this negative review especially when you make it personal about the way a person looks and there genes and not about the job. brandi is remarkable and adorable. she cuts my son & my husband's hair and does an amazing job.
"i called to make an appointment (they don't take appointments i learned) with someone who has expertise in cutting curly hair. both the receptionist and the manager were really unhelpful and rude when i kept asking if there were specific people in the salon who cut curly hair and have had the most experience cutting curly hair. they just kept saying everyone has had the same training. as a person with curly hair who has gotten some pretty awful cuts over the years, ""the same training"" is not in any way reassuring. i've had plenty of people with ""training"" mess up my hair cut. it is not true that just anyone can cut curly hair, or rather they can cut it, but not well. their lack of help was very disappointing, as was their attitude. i was looking forward to trying them as they are in my neighborhood and affordable but sadly i will not."
i give this place two stars. i had two different cutters and three visits. try try again. each time i had to adjust shaping and short hair adjusted around ears and needed a trim again really in two weeks. the two haircuttery also did similar cuts.. the supercuts cut!! it is certainly worth the $20 then for this non haircut...
i've been getting my hair cut by brandi at supercuts for about two years and she does a great job. i have incredibly curly hair and she seems to know just how to cut it. if you have curly hair ask for her.
i was just astounded by a review i just read on yelp about brandi.. i was completely in a bind and i needed my hair colored totally last minute. i arrived at supercuts at 8:45 on june 21st. i was taken by brandi for a full ombré color . i felt totally horrible about the situation & brandi pleasantly did my hair even though i didn't leave the salon until 11:15 (which i presume was much past their closing ) i am a complete believer in yelp reviews & i can't believe yelp kept such a unreliable review about brandi! there seems to be an underlying problem that chris j has with brandi & i hope my faith yelp will investigate this review
"i have been going to this location for about 5 years now and everyone in there is extremely friendly and welcoming. the manager, mary, always greets me with a warm hello every time i walk through the door. i've received many great cuts there but ever since brandi showed up i get my haircut from her when she's around because it's exactly what i want every time! i couldn't ask for a more consistent, friendly, professional stylist! as a retail manager myself, i can say she is the type of person every business would want on their team. keep up the great work, brandi!"
"i've been getting weekly blow outs her by tina, she is awesome!  it would be great if the frequent buyer program could apply to blow outs, they are more costly than a haircut. i'll keep coming back and will refer tina."
"usually when people talk to me about my hair and what products i've tried it's one of my more enthusiastic conversations. i can talk about 4 odd things really intensely: candy, dogs, working out, and curly hair products. you probably usually touch on these subjects as small talk and if you're talking to me all of a sudden you'll find themselves taking notes while i'm showing you random websites on your phone. the curly hair products obsession is because of the mixed-race thing. i think there will be more and more of us in the future and so i want to be ready to advise those future 1/4 germans 1/4 jamaicans 1/4 croatians 1/4 japanese what to use. so when people ask me: where do you get your hair cut????? i'm always mumbling ""supercuts"".... like realllly mumble. ask me three times and you still can barely hear me. and i admit, it's because i'm a little embarrassed that the hair product combination i use is way more expensive than the place i get my hair cut. i get it. it's not fancy. i think a 19 year old cut my hair the other day. but i don't care! it's a curly hair thing. if all i need is a trim, then supercuts is just great. i'm easier than a dude because my hair springs back and you can't tell if it's uneven or not. so why pay $50 at a salon for a regular trimming? no thank you ma'am. sure if i'm getting something fun and new done i've gone other places. otherwise i'll take a $20 trim and shampoo from these cats any time. and they're not pretentious at all about it. they're happy to see me and easy going. thumbs-up."
omg - a big 5 stars for melissa (not missy!) who has now been cutting my 6 year old's hair since september.  she is great (the place - probably 3 stars - but she gets 5).  so patient and great with my little one.and for $12 - what a deal!!thanks again to danny bonaduce (love him!  and he married amy - a yelper - so go danny!) for sending us to supercuts.they make my kiddo supercute.
"got my hair cut here last night.  needed a quick walk-in haircut due to a last-minute trip to visit family in canada.my haircut certainly was quick (earning this joint one star), but i can honestly say that i am currently sporting the worst haircut for which i have ever paid $17, and possibly one of the worst haircuts i have ever seen.to describe the cut itself: high and tight on the left side (scalp visible about two inches above the left ear), not nearly as high and not nearly as tight on the right side. some jennifer aniston-style layering (unrequested) on the one side, uneven sideburns, and a patch of loose hair on the neck.the hair dresser's name was alex (possibly), but it's hard to tell because everything happened so fast.  the only time she spoke was to offer me a monotone list of upsells: ""any waxing?  any coloring?  any hair products?  want your eyebrows done?""  she finished my awful haircut in about three minutes then ran to the register without offering me a chance to even look at the back.  i was so put off by her repulsive attitude that i just handed her a twenty and scooted out the door.  i guess i figured, ""i paid money for this haircut.  how bad could it possibly be?""i found out this morning at work, when at least five of my coworkers asked me if i had cut my hair myself. needless to say, i shant be returning to the ol' supercuts in this lifetime.  i write this review in an attempt to caution any and all potential supercuts victims."
"the female stylists are great listeners (especially brandi) and gave me the type of cut i wanted each time. the male stylist, however, seemed to go his own way both times i let him cut my hair. i have short, thick, curly hair. the first time, i figured i'd just let it grow and i'd get over it, as the curls will cover any unevenness. the second time, however, he completely butchered my natural part and the way my hair lies on its own. this was over 6 months ago and my hair is -still- an uneven mess. i am trying to let it grow out before i go see one of the more high-end stylists in the city to fix the mess on my head. very displeased. if you're particular about your style, it's worth it to pay for better service elsewhere."
"great place to get your haircut at, super reasonably priced as well. i highly recommend mike, whom has been cutting my hair for about 2 years. he has cut it when it's short and long, and i'm always pleased.  the other stylists are great as well.  always super friendly and efficient. be sure to try the app for more convenience and a shorter wait time!"
horrible customer service.  do not use this location.  my wife walk in with my son. and they basically lied and said there was a 3.5 hour wait when there was only two people there and three stylists there.  and not that many people checked in.  they just didn't want to cut a kids hair.  if you have a kid done go here. they are not kid friendly and down right rude.  this is the second time something like this happened.
"don't bother checking in online. still had to wait an hour after i showed up to get my haircut. they had 3 people stocking shelves, 2 at the register, and only 3 cutting hair. mike was a chill dude though"
"i checked in online an hour ago, somehow i still have to wait another half hour. slowest mediocre haircut that $20 can buy."
"fool me once, shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me. i can't believe i make the mistake of returning to this place again and again. it's quite frustrating. the name of this place should be re-labeled to hit or miss. i figured, hey it's sue. she did a pretty good job on my hair last time. nope. she spent way less attention to detail to my back like the last two times i got a cut from her. maybe it was because it was an hour before closing time, i'm not sure. i told her, like i tell everyone who cuts my hair to leave the top long (at least a fingerlength) which she readily acknowledged at the start of the haircut. however, she just kept snipping quickly and by the time i realized, it was too late. if i pull with the tips of my fingers, maybe i can get a cm of hair from my scalp. seriously. additionally, it takes a while for me to grow my hair back. there's a certain trust you give to a person to let them cut your hair. when they royally screw up time and again, they should lose that privilege. the last thing i want to do after a long day of work when i'm tired is scrutinize my barber's work in real time and stop them every other minute to make sure they're doing what they're supposed to be. if anything, it is the barber who should stop and ask ""is this too long, should i cut some more?"" this never happens at supercuts. people only go to this place because it's convenient, quick and easy. but at $18 it's clearly not worth it. i would rather spend much more and get a decent haircut so i'm taking my money elsewhere from now on . i will be searching for a new place on yelp and elsewhere. if you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know. i urge you to take your money elsewhere."
you get what you pay for. crappy hair cut. will be going to another salon to get it fixed. worst hair cut of my life.
"worst bangs trim ever!!! avoid this place. i left with my bangs still soaking wet, and had to go home and recut it because she missed a huge chunk and it was crooked. my 3yo would have done a better job!"
"hit or miss. the revolving door of employees clearly states the type of environment here.  5 people waiting, only two stylists working.  it's often like this when i come. understaffed and always a wait.  the staff is friendly for the most part but this company needs to get their act together. you pay for what you get. cheap haircut, cheap service."
"have been coming to this supercuts for many years. marie is the only person to cut and color my hair. she is patient, courteous and always honest about what will work/not work for my hair."
"i went there for a walk in, they didn't tell me i had to check in on their computer screen. people then came in and checked in ahead of me. the employees then mocked me, don't go here."
"what is the point of signing-in online? we're still waiting for 45 minutes after the appointment time for the haircut! supercuts, please fix your online scheduling system!  you do not give your stylists enough time for appointments. on saturday mornings, why would you schedule only two stylists? once in the chair, all was good. friendly professional stylists but the wait is dreadful."
"today, i went into supercuts for a trim.  the only available stylist was katie...she was blonde and had tattoos, and was not friendly.  i told her i only wanted ""the minimum amount of hair"" off.  she took about 6 inches off.  i am absolutely horrified.  also, it did not seem like she knew what she was doing which made me nervous the whole time.i will never go back to this supercuts in my life.  usually i try to go to generic hair salons to save money on trims and high end salons for highlights.  from now on i'm sticking to high end salons for both trims and highlights."
great place! mike has a great personality and he us very creative. i love how he makes my hair look.
"edited to only include my disgust with the warts!!! i'm disgusted after my last visit to supercuts. during the shampoo service, or massage service rather, my stylist katie put her forearms all over my face as she washed my hair. we finish up at the washing station only for me to spot the giant uncovered wart that she had on her forearm. now she was just rubbing that arm all over my face. disgusting!!! if you're going to put your arms all over someone's face make sure you cover up your warts!!!!"
sue did a great job on my long hair cut just enough! had a great experience and the prices weren't bad at all. will definitely be back :)
"marie recently cut my hair and she was amazing!!!!!i hate getting my hair cut because i feel like stylists always try to pressure me into being more high maintenance than i naturally am, but marie listened to what i wanted while offering helpful suggestions."
"after moving to this area from the suburbs i tried many different barbers & hair salons. i finally struck gold at supercuts in roxborough. take my advice schedule appointment with katie let her do the tea treatment on your hair then get your haircut. you will be hooked for life. the tea treatment hair washing is so relaxing sometimes i come in just to get that done, whether i need a haircut or not."
"terrible customer service.  checked in online for a haircut at 11:30.  i show up at 11:25, all stylists are with customers and there are 2 other people waiting so i take a seat.  no big deal, i'm early and they are busy.  at 11:40 a man and his son walk in while all the stylists are still busy and the man announces ""i signed in online for 11:30"".  ok no big deal, obviously i was here first but no need for me to interrupt all the busy workers.  so then a seat up opens up for a haircut and this walks his son over there and the starts getting a haircut.  well, at least i'll be the next person to get a haircut.  then while another stylist was finishing the man announces, ""i also had an 11:30 checkin so i'm next"".  not wanting to get in argument with this guy i assume the employees will check the computer, ask if i was there first, or do something to double check if he was next.  nope.   he gets his haircut next.i finally get my haircut at 12:15.  i mention at the end to the stylist while paying, ""hey just to let you know i also checked in at 11:30 like those two, and i was here 15 min before them"".  all i wanted was an apology.  even a stereotypical customer service apology like ""i'm sorry for the inconvenience sir.""  but no.  nothing.  so i said ""i just didn't want to be rude and interrupt you guys when i walked in, and i figured my online sign in would put me in the computer"".  to which she responded, ""well that's the way you have to do it.""  oh really?  so every customer should come in and announce when they signed in and that they are next?  and still no apology.long story short, apparently moving to the back of the line was my fault for checking in online, showing up early, and then being polite when i showed up."
nice people clean shop! great fast service ! good price and nice selection of products!
"always great service from all the ladies and guy that run this shop. they're always relaxed and in a pretty chill mood. i am usually in and out of there fairly quickly...and they are very reasonable (17.00 for a guy + tip). they also do ""cool"" cuts if your looking for the new styles. the check-in app makes getting in and out even easier. good thing going up there."
"this supercuts is great! don't expect a five star haircut at a two star cost, but you will get prompt service and at least a decent cut for a very competitive price. checking-in with the mobile app makes things really easy."
just had one of the worst haircut experiences ever.  left loose hairs everywhere. i asked for a line. i left covered in hair. no hot towel or even a wipe down.had to correct her on using a 2. never even shown the back of my head before i was told it was done.
"i really only have experience with allie; she is fun, thorough, and gives a great men's cut!  she also seems to really be interested in coloring, trying a lot of mixes on herself."
"it was like a slow moving train wreck.  the receptionist said somebody would be with me shortly.  then a few min later she came back and surprise.  she's going to cut my hair.  i asked for a fairly standard men's cut - clippers on the side, take an inch off the top and blend.  she started off with the clippers but rather than blending toward the top she was moving my hair in all random directions and taking the clippers higher and higher looking for some magic line to stop at.  when she got to the top she put some kind of product in my hair and started cutting.  she kept making my hair it mohawk shapes as she cut.  so i'm pretty worried at this point as a big cowlick in the back is standing straight up and no part of the top is even.  then she moves on to the sideburns where she does one pass with the normal clippers leaving the hair half cut half way up.  finally she asks if its done.  is it done?!?  should she do something else?  at this point i'm in such horror i just want to run out and find a barber.  is she going to fix it?  no.   i get home and my wife looks at me in horror before she starts laughing.  hands down the worst hair cut in 25 years.  it's pretty short so not sure how i can fix this for at least a week or two.  i would say that this stuff depends on the individual stylist but if you employ somebody with this level of skill you have to wonder about all of the folks there.  so best to steer clear of this location"
i went in friday morning and the first indication i should have left was the fact all these haircut dummies were out on display and several employees working on it. i asked for a simple hair cut; short on the sides; long on top. 1 or 2 on the sides. the hairstylist clearly didn't hear me because she used the electric clipper right on top of my head. i stayed silent and in absolute shock as she cut a ton of hair from the top of my head. i was mortified. she left me buzzed cut. i wanted to leave and even gave her a tip. the cut was horrible i still had long strands of hair on the sides and it was uneven. i will never step foot in that establishment ever again. please train your employees.
"vince gave me an amazing shampoo/haircut experience today, really appreciated how efficiently he worked & cut my ends perfectly!"
"got turned away from supercuts because i got there 30 mins before they closed and they were ""too backed up"". i don't get this place, the employees mess with the system so u can't check in online properly and then turn you away. seems like very bad management. i guess i will be going to to great clips next time!! thanks for wasting my time."
"i still drive up from nc to see my stylist, alaina, at the wynnewood supercuts. she's the best."
"francine there is really truly talented at color, by the first time i went to her her highlights were fine and subtle and look so natural and she was genuinely happy and excited for the outcome of my hair. the second time they came out bleach blonde and she refused to tone them and i am unhappy with how streaky and stark they look.my appointment was later in the day and left my iphone charger there, by the time i had gotten home and realized they were close, and called the very next day to pick it up and it was nowhere to be found. shady. edit: found and returned! good on them :)"
dara was excellent and professional . hope to return again and book with dara. the app makes it easier. it's best paying $50 for a haircut....
"no.... seriously ...... take your time.   take a break between doing haircuts and go text and drink coffee and talk to the other employees when you have an entire waiting room of people.  this was typed in a sarcastic tone, by the way. no smiles, no ""welcome"", no making you feel as if anyone cares.  besides getting an awful haircut, i have never felt more like i was bothering the employees by being there."
"sumbal is the absolute worst!!!  she flat out lied, which i don't understand.  said she could cut a bob and then it became obvious she had no idea what a bob was.  so why lie???  worst haircut i've had in years and will take months to grow it out.  and one side is longer than the other.  barbara was the best but she left in the winter & there's been noone even close to replace her.  would give zero stars if i could.  the new manager is nasty also.  will never go there again"
"from check in to haircut to paying one of the worst customer service experiences i have had ever.  i have been going here for at least 10 years, almost all new staff.  i myself have a career in customer service and had anyone along the way would have listened and cared about my experience things would have been great.  we can never lose site why we are here in the service world whatever the price may be.  not too mention quality wise it was the worst haircut i have ever had, glad its just hair and will grow, although i will be wearing hars for a while.you have a great customer base in the community, without good service that will go away.after further thought i will not return to a supercuts again.  ten days later my haircut actually got worse as it grew in, uneven and just not good.  spoke with someone in customer service who mentioned a free haircut of which was never received or followed up on, not that i am interested in using it.  overall the company seems to be more interested in volune than quality and service as it used to be."
"i went there for a hair color of simple black and my roots came out blonde the stylist was truly inexperienced. i usually go to a high end salon in center city but thought i could save some time by staying in the burbs big mistake. i refused to pay for the terrible hair color i would never suggest going there for anything, terrible experience. don't waste your money on inexperienced operators"
"it's supercuts.  some of the stylists are better than others.  i took my kids here for years and only had one disappointing cut.i give this supercut props because more than once i saw stylists serving customers with a range of special needs and they were so gracious and easygoing with the customers, very professional."
"i've been meaning to write this because i found this woman on here and i'm so glad i did!  anyway, i'm not really a ""spend money on pampering myself"" kind of person, so when browsing around to find a spot to get a reasonably priced hair cut, i read some yelp reviews.  one such review mentioned a woman named flo as being superb....sooo, lucky for me, when i went to check in on the website, flo was working that day, so i booked with her.  now, let me tellll you...i felt like i was at the spa, i've never been to the spa, but flo sure made my experience ""spa-like."" i wish she could wash my hair everyday, all day...it was like that.  then she spent a decent amount of time cutting and straightening my hair to perfection which lasted like an entire week.  the whole time i was in the chair, i was thinking that the haircut was going to cost me an arm and a leg because some of the reviews i had read had warned about hidden charges, but flo charged me as advertised on the board.  my only regret is that i didn't tip her more; she still said it was a pleasure cutting my hair as i was leaving, but i assured her the pleasure was all mine.  i would absolutely go visit flo again!"
alaina is hands down the best stylist. she always saves my hair from myself. i love my cuts so much i also bring my two year old son and my husband to her! alaina is very talented and you won't regret booking your next appointment with her.
"went in to get my haircut and had a hooded sweatshirt, which i've worn several times without an issue. the haircutter, and older lady name started with a d, refused to cut my hair with it on. i then left, went around the corner and got an amazing cut at the barber shop with no issue. won't be returning."
"daughter treated me to a mothers' day haircut and we were happy to find that this place was open on a sunday!there was a good amount of people here but we waited less than 10 minutes. lucky me got kevin as my stylist - he was professional - fun to converse with - very knowledgable - and i will be going back because i felt confident that he can handle my hair. daughter was very happy with her cut and her stylist was also pleasant.the prices are very reasonable and next time i will get color done as well. left here feeling great, which is exactly how you should feel when you leave a salon."
i got my hair cut and blown out by a lovely lady named flo. she was wonderful. she gave me the best haircut i have had in a long time. she gave me an eyebrows wax and i looked 10 years younger when i left. i didn't even know they did waxing there. she is going to be my regular stylist from now on. thank you thank you flo
"thank you, michelle - not only did you fix the worst haircut of my life that i had gotten from elsewhere in drexel hill over the weekend, i absolutely love my new cut.  would recommend anyone looking for a professional stylist that understands the art of cutting hair to see michelle."
"michelle is amazing. somehow while multitasking her managerial duties at this busy supercuts, she also was able to focus on me as a client, which was not easy given my impulsive decision to chop off my elbow length hair and go with a super short cut. she is so talented and knowledgeable. i am sincerely grateful for her and hands down recommend her, especially if you're deciding to completely change your look. if you can't get michelle trust that the other stylists working keep open communication between each other. this is so important! every salon i have gone to has stylists working at different levels and when no one talks to each other, it is always a bad sign. i observed the stylists offering help to each other, asking questions, requesting feedback, and openly communicating in order to achieve the best results for the client."
after going to the same hairdresser for 17 years i took a chance and came here and i'm so glad i did! all i have to say is - go to michelle!!!! she gave me the prefect highlights and cut- everything i had asked for! very professional and a great head/neck massage during the wash!
"go to michelle! she goes above and beyond to meet your expectations while being professional and honest. whether it be a color, style or just a simple blow out- she's the best. also, if she washes your hair- be prepared to drift into a little piece of heaven. it's amazing. she truly cares about her customers needs/wants. not to mention she is super friendly and funny. it's nice to see someone so passionate about their job!! i always look forward to leaving the salon looking and feeling amazing! thanks michelle you rock!!!"
"michelle performed a miracle tonight.  she changed my pick hair to silver:)  i love it!  and it feels fabulous.  she used something new, marula oil by paul mitchell."
"best haircut in over 10 years! i have tried so many salons in the area, but michelle at this supercuts location is the best by far! she examined my hair prior to washing, really listened to what i wanted, and she relaxed me so much with her shampoo/scalp massage technique. then, she taught me tips to style my new do! i haven't felt this good about my hair in a very long time!"
michelle just gave me the best hair cut and color i have had in the past ten years!! she has a wonderful personality and took a lot of time and care with me.  she took the time to explain the the color choices and also the type of shampoo she would be using so my color would be soft.  such a soothing scalp massage -- i could have taken a nap.  my hair is wavy and the cut she gave was just perfect.  i will be recommending michelle to all my friends and family.  she is the best!
"great place to get a haircut. michelle is awesome! knows her stuff. i usually bring my kids with me and michelle always makes sure they get a braid, pigtails, or other surprise style after their haircuts. always leaves a smile on their faces. highly recommend!"
i love this supercuts location!  checking in online saves me time and i just earned a free cut through their new rewards system.  the entire staff is talented and professional.  i go to michelle who does the best blow dry i have ever had!  i would highly recommend.
i have two young children (1&3) and we use this supercuts for their haircuts. they get really busy so please remember to check in online before heading over to the store. they do a great job with both boys. especially the younger one who hates haircuts and squirms everywhere. prices are fair and you can get a frequent visitor card to get your 12th haircut free.
been here two or three times and the employees are less than interested in waiting on you. the haircuts are unimmpressive as well!
"i have been looking for a new stylist for awhile. since my horror of a haircut in march 2013, i have been very reluctant to even step foot inside a salon. yesterday was my breaking point and i just knew i had to do something. we all know that feeling, your hair is just done and you are over it. so i made the decision to get my haircut and i starting my research. i called a few places and asked questions but none of them really gave me a good feeling. then i called supercuts and spoke with julie. she immediately put me at ease and answered all my questions with no hesitation at all. this was just what i needed. i went to the location, and luckily it wasn't too far from my house. i walked in and took a look around. the place was clean and looked good. i was the only one there, which was fine with me since i am not a fan of waiting. i spoke to julie again and went over the cut i wanted and explained my past experience. (check out my review of hair-cut one hundred) again, she put me at east and totally understood what i wanted. i sat in the chair and off we went. she was awesome and showed me everything that she was doing. she put up with all my questions and indecisiveness. she was truly a professional.  i will definitely go back to see julie again. thank you julie for being just what i needed to get over my hair cut phobia lol"
"called and spoke with julie, she seemed knowledgeable and friendly. i went in with a very specific look and brought pictures. i was greeted with professional staff and welcoming smiles. julie and i spoke about what i wanted and as she cut we talked about the hair cut. i left very happy and couldn't wait to tell my husband so we could all start coming here. cut looked even better after i washed and blew it dry, she did exactly what i wanted."
"i got home with highlights that i didn't like, so i quickly went over to supercuts and alexis did a fantastic job! she used a sample book to discuss what i wanted, then mixed a nice shade of toner and applied it twice so my highlights were much tamer. next time i'm just going to alexis to begin with!also, my husband has been very happy with julie here."
"i am thrilled to have supercuts a walk away from my home in fairmount.  read reviews of people complaining about wait time-but i keep my wait expectations in check as calling ahead or signing up online is still not the same as scheduling an appointment.  sometimes it's slow and i walk right back, sometimes i wait...not a big deal.my favorite stylist is sophie - always pleasant and gregarious.  but her real talent is with color.  i go every five weeks to have my roots touched up and enjoy the salon environment as this is a multi-step process.  everyone is pleasant and seemingly enjoying their craft.  i look forward to returning in five weeks time."
"bad, bad bad system!!!so, i call. ""only one person ahead.  come over now""  i arrive, one person sitting.  i register, and the nice woman says, ""you'll be next with her"".  great. !"" 2 new people come in, sit down.  they registered online.  my""turn"" arrives, and my cutter takes another person.confused i ask:  ""can you explain your system here??  i called, was told to come in, one person ahead, and that i'd be next with you!""  ""i'm so sorry, they made a reservation online""  ""well, that's great.  i've been here 2o minutes expecting that what your colleague said was true :that i was next with you!""  ""well, we're short staffed..."" not about being short-staffed.  it's about being clear and communicating correctly.  you should have told me when i registered that several people had reserved online and that i could be bumped and bumped. cause now i'm pissed off, i'm going to walk out, never come back and write a bad review on yelp'  ""i'm sorry. have a nice day""  ""you just wasted 30 minutes of it"""
"this is my second time at the location and i have never been more impressed. the first time i thought maybe i just got lucky with who cut my hair but somehow this place is packed with highly-skilled, consummate professionals who are also good people. after most haircuts, i only look forward to the coming weeks when my hair grows out, but both times here i was actually happy to have someone mention that i got my hair cut. the only other place in the world i've gotten quality cuts is top notch barbershop back home and that costs 35 bucks. this is half the price and was probably even better."
courtney cut my hair today. she was so nice and personable and did a great job on my haircut. i  will definitely be going back to this salon and to courtney. i   checked in online and was seen right away. great experience!
"after my last visit i was extremely hesitant to come back, but finding out that the horrible 'stylist' was no longer there, i scheduled an appointment.i was just expecting to get my haircut and eyebrow waxing, but after showing beth a picture of the cut i wanted, she suggested that we add some color to accentuate my new cut and i was totally down.beth was so personable and professional that i immediately felt comfortable. she gave me a gorgeous haircut and stunning color. i've never been so pleased with my hair color either!i'm super happy with my hair and will definitely come back :)"
"i was walking down the street when i saw the supercuts on hamilton street. i was in desperate need of a haircut so i figured i would go in. at first i was a little hesitant because i have heard good and bad stories about supercuts. well, i'm glad i stopped in. the young lady who cut my hair, i can't remember her name but she was all tatted up, did a fabulous job. she was super friendly, outgoing and knew exactly what i wanted.i will definitely return for my next haircut and when i do i will get the young lady's name."
"i'm not one of those people who prefer to go to salons to get a haircut. i'm pretty basic and usually need a trim, maybe a bang trim, maybe some layers. because of i don't want to pay an arm and a leg for a haircut. some might say i'm taking a big chance but 99% i have been fine. this location opened last year in spring garden among some restaurants, nail salons, convenience stores, etc. it's clean and minimal, just how i like it.  i also like that you can check in online before you arrive. today was my second haircut here and it was $23 which included the shampoo and conditioning. originally i wanted a blow out but the girl who did my hair took a little long. but she was meticulous and attentive.would i go here for color services? no. but for the basics, this place is perfect."
called for an appointment asked if they could do 1:15 they took the appointment and there's 5 other people waiting for their cut when i show up. why not just say it's going to be 30 minute wait no matter when you show up? they don't respect your time at this establishment.
"i have been here several times and got a decent haircut for a good price.  i walked in today to get a haircut and sat there for over an hour waiting to get called up.  when i first came in there were only two guys ahead of me and then one after another ""online check-in"" walks in and goes in front of me.  i understand you have check-ins online, but you can't have a customer sit there over an hour, i will not be going there again."
"moved to philly five years ago and tried multiple places for haircuts.  i was thrilled to find sophie at supercuts.  i usually make sure it's a quiet time of day and just leave and return if it's too busy.  i used to bounce from place to place, but i love knowing supercuts is around the corner and open every day."
"i asked to get my hair dyed burgandy and the woman bleached my brownish blonde hair so it could come out more vibrant. but then when she first applies the dye, it came out practically black. she said it was ""a little dark"" and i was like ""a little?!?"" so she put in bleached shampoo to try to lighten it but the finished product was still a very dark reddish brown. i asked if she could lighten it and she said ""it will fade after a few washes."" but i've dyed my hair vibrant colors before and when you wash it, the vibrancy goes away too. so after a few washes i imagine it will turn dark brown. but even still, it's not the color i wanted now. and that's what she was saying to get me out of a refund i guess. i also paid for a waxing and i'm pretty sure she didn't know how to do that as well. you're supposed to go against the grain and do it in peices. but she put was one my whole stache and tried ripping it all off in one go, downwards with the grain. i didn't notice how bad the job was until the next day when the redness went away. there were still a few hairs leftover in very waxable places that i could have plucked myself. also i have short hair. maybe medium depending on who you ask. but it doesn't touch my shoulders. and one of the assistants told the hair dresser to charge me for long hair. i'm over here like ""excuse me?? does this look long to you??""so in the end i wasted $110 to damage and dry out my hair (because of the two bleaching process) dye my hair dark brown (which is more towards my natural color anyway) and get a less than decent waxing job that hurt like crazy. thanks."
"goodness this place sucks !!!! it's now 7:15pm... if i asked at 6:30pm ""how long is the wait"" and you say 10mins, what clock are you using??? fyi only one person was waiting besides me..and yes, he left a while ago... if i wasn't in a pinch i would've left!!"
"i have been to this location twice and had fantastic service from zoey! cut, color, and style have been superb. i like the paul mitchell products so much i bought some to take home and my hair hasn't looked for felt this good in a long time. --you can call and schedule and appointment on the day you want to come in or download the app and check in before you get there so the wait time is not as long. --prices are reasonable and they have specials every day of the week too"
courtney is a true skilled profesional. best haircut i've had in a long time.
husband took my son for a haircut since this place was close by and convenient on a sunday afternoon. thought he'd be in good hands as we've taken him to a different supercuts with great results.gave the woman specific instructions on how to cut his hair. even showed her pictures of how it's been cut in the past. the cut was choppy and uneven. even his sideburns were cut at two very different lengths. called the store to see if i could bring him back the next day but in the end decided to go to the location where he regularly goes.
"so i was in desperate need of a haircut. i called as soon as they opened & this angel beth m answered immediately. she said ""come on in. i will fit you in and i will fix your hair."" i went in looking & feeling down. but beth m fixed my hair & beard into a new style that i never tried before and it turned out amazing! i walk around with this new style looking great with my head held high now. thanks to beth m, i am alittle more happy and confident about my appearance. thanks so much beth m at supercuts."
"i've been here 3 times. twice as a walk-in, waited 50 minutes b fore giving up and leaving. finally made an appointment the third time and still waited 45 minutes. this place is just totally understaffed. advertises as a place with quick service, but doesn't deliver"
"such an awesome location with a bunch of talented and very friendly stylists! i love how convenient it is, especially since they do color and waxing in addition to haircuts. just what the neighborhood needed!!"
really great service here. friendly and talented staff.  you may have a wait...but after all they are  a walk in salon. these ladies work extremely hard to get the job done !!
"recently increased their prices to 20 dollars, and they try to rush you out of there without a proper cut. didn't get what i asked for either, and the lady said that she had cut hair for 15 years. mentioned that i wanted a part and said that she couldn't because i had too much hair in the way. no longer a cheap haircut so i'd pay the extra 10-15 and go to an actual barber shop or salon."
kaylee did a great job love the new hair cut! this is my second hair cut at this location they do a great job!
ivana was wonderful and got everything exactly how i want it. great job. would highly recommend!
had a great appointment today with tori. my son had a very specific idea of how he wanted his hair done and she was the best at working with his needs. for sure coming back to this location in the future!
great experience!  tori was super friendly!  i would recommend coming in.  make sure to check in on line.
tori was super friendly and kind! she was very helpful with information on how to keep my hair healthy with the products recommended.
"the stylist shall remain nameless since she never bothered to tell me her name even after i asked if her name was ""____"" she said no,  and never said what it was.  i felt like we were uninvited guests to the employee's party"
"first let me say that the only reason i gave this place 2 stars was because a former stylist named joey was fabulous.  he cut my hair twice and was superb. i've been back 2 more times since joey left.  2nd visit....waited 45 minutes.  this was after my online check in time. i saw jackie.  meh.  a flat tire has more personality.  i give the cut an 8. she didn't smile, didn't ask me anything.  jackie shouldn't be in the retail business if she's not a people person.3rd time- i checked in online for an 11:20 appt with michelle, the manager.  got there at 11:10.  it'll be 20 minutes.  fine. no problem.she's talking about herself to the customer.talking to another stylist about hiring another stylist.asking if this other stylist tick tock tick tock tick tock            tick tock tick tock.one hour latershe's sweeping the floortaking tape out of the registertakes something out of her purse and goes into the bathroom.10 minutes more! i'm not sure what the reason is for checking in on-line if we're just going to sit there for an hour anyway.  i sat there for an hour on purpose, waiting to see if at least one person said anything to me as i was the only one there.nobody said anything.i left.not a phone call (you have to check in with a phone number)  i'm going back to my ""real"" salon where they care about their customers."
"the stylist was nice and haircut is fine but unfortunately i left with a bad taste in my mouth. apparently the owners do not allow coupons that aren't printed. which is so silly. i register my email address today, downloaded the app so that i could check in and save time. i received an email with a $2 off coupon. i checked in on the app, arrived. waited 30 minutes.... got my haircut and then tried to use my coupon only to be told it had to be printed to be accepted. i think that is rediculous. we are in a digital world. it should say on the coupon that it must be printed to be honored. it's too bad that the owners make up a bogus policy and require the stylist enforce it. this makes the final minutes of the transaction unpleasant which could effect the amount of a tip (i still tipped appropriately). it did definitely confirm the fact that i won't be returning to this location."
absolutely amazing service!!got my eyebrows done by joey and my hair cut by casey. they both did an amazing job i'm so pleased! the salon is very clean and the staff is friendly. i will be a regular from now on.thanks guys!!
"garbage place, went in for a haircut on sunday and was trying to get a faux hawk. they ended up buzzing the top side of my head than continued to just straight buzz cut it as i couldn't change it from there. my girlfriend and i were very specific on what we wanted done and they spent maybe 3mins on my girlfriend and i. did a terrible job and no manager has bothered to look into this and the owner doesn't take responsibility for their employees. on top of that they cut my girlfriends hair in different lengths and now has to get it cut shorter and she didn't want to do so cause of her 21st birthday.  $40 spent on top of $30 for a hat to cover up the buzz cut. already spoke with a lawyer about this horrible situation and mental stress they have caused my girlfriend and i along with ruining her hair plans for her 21st birthday. don't ever go here as the owner or managers make no attempt in providing good customer service. i will be going forward in suing this location for their actions."
"bad! i have been using this salon since they opened. its close to where i live so its convenient. over the last 6 months i have been going when they open@8 on saturdays as it works best for me and each time i feel like i am an inconvenience its the same stylist ""jackie"" this last time was the end all for me with the salon not only did she open the salon late (as usual) she didnt say one word to me other than ""how do u want it cut"" no good morning nothing  she then did one quick swoop around my hair pulled off my cape and said ok ur done never even asked if it was ok if i needed anything else etc. although i was disappointed i still left my normal 5.00 tip but won't be back. i will drive out of my way for better customer service."
"went in for an overdue cut today. it's nice to have a location closer to home.the wait was pleasant and i was taken care of very quickly. what i also really like about this salon is that they are a full service salon, they provide waxing services and at very reasonable prices. the stylist was engaging, fun to chat with and she listened carefully to my needs and wishes and did an outstanding job. i will stick with this location from now on."
"i made an appointment with michael today base on several good reviews and i am very happy i did.  he did a great job of highlighting, lowlighting and cutting my hair.  i am extremely pleased and he was also very pleasant.  i highly recommend him!  i plan to be a regular customer."
this is the only place (including high dollar salons) that can cut my long thick hair. most places attempt to cut it in two different chunks but then they can never get it blended. i always end up back at supercuts if an attempt at another salon is ventured.
"i had a color, cut and style.  i was overjoyed with the out come.  the staff was amazing the salon was clean and i have nothing but positive thoughts and comments to say about the salon. thank you michael for great hairdo.!!!!!"
i went in for a hair cut and shampoo. michael did a very good job on my haircut. along with my eye brow waxing. this supercuts location is very clean and embraces a positive work environment. keep up the hard work!
"not so super of an experience. will never go back. my husband and son needed haircuts so we decided to try this place out instead of where we normally go as i thought it would be ok. we waited almost an hour (not a surprise because there was a lot of people waiting but we thought we will see how it goes) only to become #1 and 2 on the list (yay we are next!) and they call the people who are #4, 5, and 6! we had been waiting longer then the people they called, we saw them check in so it wasn't an online check in and it clearly showed they were after us on the list! we were so angry we left and will never go back. the people who work there didn't even notice that after sitting almost an hour we were getting up and leaving. this was about an hour ago. we will go next week to our normal place (sport clips) where it may cost more but we aren't invisible. we didn't throw a fit (wanted to!) because i didn't want to make the people they called feel bad as it wasn't their fault. so no, i do not recommend this place. would give zero stars if it were possible."
"britney is an incredibly talented and confident stylist. i've been coming here for couple of months. from shampooing, the haircut itsel all the way to product recommendations, she has steered me in the right direction each and every time. there are other supercuts that are closer to my home in gilbert, but i am so happy to drive a few extra miles for the privilege of working with her."
super disappointed with my sons hair cut from yesterday (3/31/16). my husband took our son in for a hair cut and he came home with something that looked like i did it in our kitchen. his hairline in the back was so bad i can't even begin to describe it. his sideburns are very uneven and so is his front hair line. i have to take him to another place today to have it fixed. i would never recommend going to this location. i would give them zero stars if i could.
every time i try to go to this location they have an excuse as to why they can't take me. the whole idea of supercuts is the convenience of no appointment necessary. however even after i check in on line they turn me away. i think the people who work there just don't want to do color. if it was just one time i would say no big deal but this is the 4th time in the last year that they have turned me away for a simple root touch up of brown hair. i will never go back to this location again. tgey have horrible customer service and they obviously do not want my business.
best experience ever toni took care of me cut my hair really good i would say come here had me in and out 10 minutes
"i don't usually go to supercuts, but, i work next door. toni is awesome!  i needed a new do and she talked with me and gave me just what we had decided. then i went back yesterday and wanted something new again.  she gave me another great cut! thanx girl."
"outstanding haircut by rocky! she talks you through what she is going to do and makes you feel comfortable in the chair. i was impressed by her skill and her accuracy of the haircut. i will definitely be returning to this young, hip gal."
first time coming to super cuts. wih that said let me add i'm big on not ever going anywhere to get my hair cut. one bad time did it for me. however i was having issues with my scam and an excellent recomendation to get the lavender tea tree shampoo and conditioner helped. as i'm getting a scalp massag and wash hot towels were a plus for the face. made my over all experience pleasurable. on to the hair cut. sarah f cut my hair and did and excellent job as i told her what i liked and didnt like. she put hope back in my heart for being able to get my hair cut again!!! keep it up!! i might be a regular.
very friendly and fun conversations to be had over here. the store manager toni is very knowledgeable and passionate about what she does. it's good to be able to go someplace where i know i can get a quality service done fast and for a great price. just passing through the area and needed a quick touchup before i went back to san diego and got just what i was looking for. love people with great customer service skills and always want them to feel recognized and appreciated. thanks again.
"i'm on vacation visiting friends and needed a trim. the stylist, toni was upbeat, welcoming and professional. i was very happy with my haircut and the service!"
i took my granddaughter for a trim.  saw a lady leaving with a super cute short cut. i needed a cut and asked who cut her hair.  she said toni so i had my hair cut after my granddaughter's trim.  toni did the best cut i have had in a year. i hope she never leaves chandler.  she is awesome.
toni is amazing with color! she did an all over low light and highlight color on me and it was spot on! she's got an amazing eye for what you ask for! she's also fun and friendly!
"i come in evey couple of months. on my last visit i was very happy with the service. almost never a long wait. the manager of the salon heidi, did an absolutely amazing job. i had a haircut and brow wax. one of the best brow jobs i have ever had. the cut was great too. she took the time to explain what cut would work best for my face. all of the stylists are super friendly. would deffinatly  recommend this location."
i was extremely satisfied with my hair cut.  heidi was genuinely concerned with making sure i got exactly what i wanted.  she took exceptional time and care with me. i was in town visiting from new york and making this quick stop was a risk.  i am so happy i found heidi.
"toni is a great stylist. she is very professional and is excellent at both cut and color. i have trusted her with my hair many, many times. she's also done wonders with my eyebrows, so get a wax while you're there! i would recommend toni to anyone."
"extremely pleased with my cut and color-- toni listened to me describe my ""hair concerns"" and she magically fixed it all.   i am from out of town, so was not sure where to go.   i recommend supercuts...good clean salon, reasonable prices and talented stylists.  don't hesitate to try.....they are great!"
toni is amazing!! she's worked wonders on my hair! :) she always makes sure i leave absolutely satisfied! she listens to what you want and pays attention to detail! and her skills with color are phenominal!! i would recommend her to anyone! :)
i love going to this location for my haircuts. veronica knows exactly what she is doing and always makes sure i am 100% happy with my hair. i don't know a lot about hairstyles so i let her do what she thinks will look good. she always gives me a slightly new look and i'm always satisfied with it. the stylists always genuinely greet me right when i walk in the door. there a plenty of supercuts closer to my home but i'd rather make the trip and know i'll be happy with the results.
"i've been a client at this supercuts for eight years. no longer.  i've received two haircuts in that entire time i wasn't happy with (both this past year).  recently, a cut left my hair butchered. i told my brother's gf i look like a homeless rag doll.  i asked the gal that cut it if she could fix it and she said i had to get back in the store within the same week.  an appliance emergency at home and my work schedule, made it impossible to get in within that time period (it had to match her work schedule she said) leaving me with this awful haircut. i expressed my sadness on fb because i cried every morning that week when i looked in the mirror at my hair.  the stylist text me saying she'd never touch my hair again and to basically f off. i don't deserve nasty text messages.  that's not ok. very disrespectful."
"stylist was young and fairly inexperienced. she also took way too long and i had to point out on multiple occasions when she was ""done"" that hair length was uneven in certain areas.this place is hit or miss when it comes to quality."
"the wife scheduled our 2 young kids for haircuts via their website.  she shows up on time and is told website scheduling isn't working and that she'll need to wait 30-45 minutes.  wife asks for a discount and is told they'll need to call a district mgr to approve that and that will cause them to have to stop cutting peoples' hair ... which then caused customers to turn on my wife and start saying nasty things to her in front of our kids.  terrible, terrible, terrible.  we had been frequent customers at that location ... but no more!"
lame... got here at 6:30 and was told they stop taking haircuts at 6:30 but close at 7... what ever... the older lady there looked like she hates her job... i guess that's what you get at one of these cheap places... crappy customer service...
it's great. it's a normal supercuts experience and i got a quick solid haircut. i don't know why everyone else is complaining about this store - it's not any different than other supercuts. i'd go back (i've been about 5 times).
"yeah, idk what's going on with the stylists at this location. there was one girl that worked there that was really good and i haven't seen her in months. i guess she quit and went to a sports clips. any time supercuts gets a good employee they wind up quitting and going somewhere else. it's so sad. anyway, the last 2 haircuts i got here were pure crap...i mean, they were uneven and weren't even what i asked for. granted, my hair is a little difficult since it grown in like 50 different directions...it doesn't seem like the stylists care or really analyze someone's hair before they start chopping at it. it seems like supercuts must be a terrible company to work for since employees keep quitting and the ones that do work there seem like they don't care. i'm sure there's real talent currently employed there but doesn't seem like the company is tapping into that talent. i'm definitely going to try a different place. ya know, for just a few $$ more you can go to a full service salon."
"despite the bad reviews, i went here for a bang trim. i figured you cant ruin a bang trim, right? wrong. i got in my car and straightened out my bangs and there were long pieces everywhere. i thought to myself, is 7 dollars worth it to let this lady hack my hair some more? nope. so i went home and fixed them myself... listen to the bad reviews and take your money elsewhere"
"i went in today to get a haircut and was told, supercuts was not going to give courteous neck trims, that it would cost the same price as a haircut???? really? how do you compare a 25 minute haircut to a 3 minute neck trim??? at the same price??? either they go back to courteous free neck trims or lose many male customers, me included. on a positive note, shantie and lana are always great at giving haircuts, i have been going there for 6 plus years now."
"i went to this location with my dad on 27th sep, 2015 and it turned out to be an ugly experience!! i'm definitely not going back ever again and will make it a point to spread the word to people i know who live in the area. there were two girls working at that time and one of them that was going to give me a haircut was super rude and downright racist! her behavior seemed to stem from the fact that 1) i walked in late (although i had told her in the beginning that i could come back next day if it was too late) and 2) that i'm an indian (and she did not want to deal with even a bit of accent or non american names). it was such a display of unprofessionalism and disrespect for the customer!! i got up and told her that i did not want a haircut from her! the other girl (with a distinct tattoo on her arm) was very embarrassed by her colleague's behavior and in fact asked her to leave right away. unfortunately all of this unfolded in front of my dad who is visiting from india for few days and i'm sad that he'll leave with the wrong impression of an otherwise superb city."
"unless you get mallory, don't other. so i called at 9ish and made an appointment for 11. i got there around 10 to and when i walked in heather was cutting someone else's hair and didn't even look over just said, ""did you call before you came in?"" and i said yes, i have an 11 o'clock appointment. she said nothing more. that should have been my first hint. at 11 she calls me back. i showed her a pic of what i wanted and told her i wanted about an inch off so it comes to the bottom of my neck and she took me back and washed my hair and sat me down. when she began to cut she segmented the front off and brushed the back down and boom cut straight across and took off 2-3 inches  (well above the bottom of my neck) i wanted the front angled and i even stopped her at one point because she just grabbed a chunk and went to snip n i said wait wait wait that's a lot and she says oh i'm gonna go down. (no idea what that meant) anyways so 10 minutes later my hair is done and i look in the mirror and i'm immediately like no no no this is way too short n she says well i told you you wouldn't be able to pull it back  don't know what the hell that was supposed to mean. then she says you're done. i ask her for a mirror to look at the back (thank god) and it wasn't even even and there were chunks of stray hair and i told her about it and she said ""well that's because it's rolled under""  what the fu** does that even mean?! i said yea well when it's straight it's gonna look even more fu**ed up! she kept arguing with me to get back in the chair so she can fix it and i'm like you will not touch my hair! my dogs could have cut my hair better than this person. thankfully mallory, the manager, was standing right there and shooed her away and did the best she could to fix it... too bad it's basically irreparable. mallory was wonderful and did what she could but heather messed up my hair so bad you would swear she's never cut hair before. i personally think she botched my hair intentionally for some reason seeing as she seemed to be in a bitter mood as soon as i walked in the door. probably feigning for a cigarette, as soon as mallory told her to go that's right where she went, sorry to impose on you heather!  and thanks for fu**ing up my hair."
"hit or miss here, depends on who you ""get."" but, there's one stylist there who doers a meticulous, thorough job, so i keep coming back. it's about 5 minutes away from my house as well, so that's a huge bonus. always a good idea to call ahead... who likes waiting for a half-hour plus-some for a trim? i don't. place is clean and pleasant, i usually have a coupon too for the $10.99 hair cut. what a deal."
i love bringing my 5 year old here. getting his haircut is always torture but the girls here are always amazing with him!! great staff and clean all around!!
"went in yesterday for a trim... specifically told the person cutting my hair i wanted a trim and showed her exactly how much i wanted taken off. i even joked they do not need to be paid for quantity, but quality. i walked out a few inches taken off my hair and instead of a trim got a full blown boy hair cut. i specifically told her several times not too short and even discussed a new shampoo i had that seemed to be making my hair grow really fast. upon finishing, i replied how short it was.... i guess my definition of a tiny, tiny bit off of the bangs and hers were two different things. then she replied guess it lucky you got the shampoo that makes your hair grow faster.  why is it there are no stylists that can cut a woman's short hair without practically shaving their head and making them look like a dude.... oh and the gouges and uneven parts are the icing on the cake....  also, she cut my hair so fast she kept slapping me in the face with her comb....."
this is the worst hair cutting shit hole i've ever been to! the stylist and front desk lady were rude and seemed rushed because they didn't want to help out a customer or cut someone's hair. my hair cut was uneven and way shorter than what i asked for not to mention they can never line up my side burns evenly like how hard is it?! i could probably cut my own hair better than any of these rude nasty stylist in definitely never going here again! i'd rather pay more money for better service and quality work!
first time i had lisa cut and  my hairi brought in a picture of what i wantedi also asked her opinion.my cut was perfect !very happy with the end results will definately be back.thanks lisa
"thought i'd impulsively get a haircut. the place was quiet, and i decided not to be off-put by the stylist who checked me in being rude.so while he was clipping a customer ahead of me, 3 stylists finished their cuts and then got very very very very very very involved with getting their equipment absolutely spotless. when i looked inquiringly in their direction, they glared & turned away. all i'd done was sit quietly with a magazine!once it became clear that my only option would be the stylist who'd already decided he couldn't understand my speech, i thanked the shop politely and left.if i looked like crap, it's because i needed a haircut! i guess i should figure i dodged a bullet, as who knows what this rude shop would have decided it was okay to do to my hair."
went in for a haircut tonight and the service was horrible. i got there and was never acknowledged. i waited for about an hour and watched 3 customers get waited on before i did. this service was ridiculous and i will not be coming back to this location. i have never had a problem with any other supercuts location.
"i have to say that i love coming to this place whenever i need to freshen up. big thank you to andy nguyen, friendly, professional, and genuine. you will be able to learn about andys life or day as he is cutting your hair. he cares about his clients and will ask you how your doing and how life is going for you lately. he will always bring a smile to your face and the place is also located next to amazing breakfast and lunch options. all around appreciate andy and super cuts at this location, there is no need for me to go anywhere else! -sammy the luxury expert @ chapman bmw camelback"
"i went in just to get my sides faded. the gentleman cutting my hair was being pretty rough (i should have said something) but i also know that i can be tender headed so i tried to ignore it. when i left, i paid and tipped him; i didn't get a receipt but didn't think too much about asking for one. by the time i got home, my head was burning in multiple spots. i looked into the mirror to find multiple areas of irritation and that he had cut me along almost the entire length of my neckline. since i don't have a receipt there's not much i can do. but i will not be back, it really sucks when a service that is supposed to help you feel good ends up doing the exact opposite!"
first time i had andy cut and color my hairi brought in a picture of what i wantedi also asked his opinion as to colormy cut and color was perfect !very happy with the end results will definately be back
lisa cut my hair. i asked as short as you can and she delivered. very happy with my even and clean hair cut. great location.
"this is not your average supercuts. it's a very nice, upscale location and everyone here is so nice. i've been going for the past 5 years or so, to see andy. he is insanely good and has an amazing following (book ahead). if andy is on vacation i'll see lisa, as she has also been here for many years and her customers rave about her as well. use their app or call in to book ahead so that you don't have a long wait. it's worth it, and you too will come to love this little gem. thanks andy for many years of friendship and making my mess of hair look great!"
"i was looking for an affordable, clean location for a haircut-i chose this supercuts mostly because it's near where i live. i was pleasantly surprised by the expert service i received from lisa, a stylist here. my only surprise came from the fact that their prices are on par with the fancier salons in the area. a good experience overall. lisa is great at her craft."
"i'm new to the area and read some reviews of this location before i went. some good and some bad but enough good ones for me to give it a try. i walked in right behind another customer so there was two of us in line. the gentleman who came over to the counter to check us in took the customer in front of me telling him ""you have two people in front of you it will be 20mins."" i walked up next and he said to me ""you will wait 1 hour, there's 3-4 people ahead of you"". i have no problem waiting i'm a patient person. but when you come off rude towards me when i watched you be polite to the person in front of me, that's when i get irritated. and you add a range # of people ahead of me when you tell the person in front of me something different. i understand the feeling of being busy and overwhelmed but don't take it out on a customer that walked in for a service (what your at super cuts to do). i walked out, not worth the wait if he was rude to me the second i walked in, can't imagine how the rest of the service would have gone."
"thank you libby, for giving me the haircut of my dreams. i wish i could put something on my head to keep my hair from growing so i would always look this good! i like this salon overall, but the talent has varied somewhat, which is why i can't give it five stars. but i'll keep coming back because i like the friendly service, reasonable prices, and accessible location."
"went to supercuts this week for a haircut and shampoo. libby id a fabulous job with the cut! it looks wonderful! and she is one of the few hair stylists that did not cut off more than i asked her to. i don't know about the other stylists here, but libby is the best!-norma"
andy has been cutting my hair at this location for 5+ years. he's consistently great and my go to hair stylist. super cuts is lucky to have andy
libby was great was honest about my color she could of easily said yes do the whole thing! but she didn't. i will fer sure have her do my color again!! very sweet person. as for the bad reviews have you ever heard you get what you put out!! maybe you get bad service because your an a**.  we all can be one i know when i'm a jerk to someone they will be a jerk back! it's human nature. try being  nice to each other you will be amazed what you get in return.
"i don't expect to be wow'd by a haircut from supercuts, but i at least expect the cut to be symmetrical! i asked for a trim and then some light layers with long bangs (chin-length). the trim alone took nearly 30 minutes as it seemed she was counting each individual strand on my head. you'd expect with such attention to detail that both sides of my head would at least be symmetical but she cut more ""bangs"" on one side of my head than the other in a completely botched attempt at layers. definitely not interested in ever returning."
libby is excellent! she repaired a botched hair color done at a nearby pricey salon! she's awesome!
"i like coming to get my haircut here. not sure what happened with the rest of these reviews, but i am always pleased with the service and price point of this supercuts! will continue to give them my business!"
"i have cut my hair twice here and before everything was perfect the girls were very nice very polite and patient but on this occasion vicky the stylist got really upset because i used my phone had a emergency call so she didn't finish the job appropriately, she rushed through it, she didn't even clean up with a warm towel like they always do. when i brought it up she argued with me saying that i was rude and that customers are not always right. i never got on her way of cutting my hair i just didn't talk to her while she was working on my hair cut and is my thought she took  it personal."
this location for supercuts is not the best experience i had.  the stylist that shaved my head was not knowledge and was too afraid to use the hair clippers to shave down to stubbles.  he was not that great but friendly and nice guy.  i would hope they can shape things up to have better stylists and knowledgeable.
"when one kid wanted a short and spiky haircut and the other wants to keep it longer like justin bieber, i realized that going to my regular barber might not be the best move, so we checked out supercuts. even walking in without an appointment they were able to get both boys in the chairs within 10 minutes and we were out of there in half an hour. both of the boys came out looking great and they were both very happy with the haircuts they received. i would definitely recommend this location, especially if you have kids who need haircuts."
i've been here several times and am mostly happy with my experience here.  wait times are generally very reasonable and the ability to check in ahead of time is a massive convenience added in the past few years.
"we visited for a back to school haircut. it was just awful, my daughter had strands that weren't cut. went back to have it fixed, still not good. don't waste your time."
"ask for landree and you'll get a 4-star haircut i guarantee. he is the most knowledgeable person there and can even give you tips and tricks on how to maintain, style and keep your hair looking good always.make sure to tell him how you want your haircut and he'll make sure you get what you want."
nice job... my bad.. didn't get her name. she has done hair now for a little over a year. young and dark brown hair. anyway i gave her specific instructions and she followed them to a t! will definitely come back here next time in town.
never had an issue with a hair stylist before but paula r. treated me like i was the last person on earth she wanted to be providing a service to. attitude not fit for customer service and not very helpful. will not be back to see her.
"olga is the best if not for her there would not be super in supercuts, she has attention to detail and makes me look like a movie star."
"just got me and my daughter's hair cut and the lady did a horrible job. i told her to cut my daughter's all one length yet it all ended up longer in the back. mine ended up sorter on one side with tons of little hairs all over my clothes when she took the apron off me and continued to cut more. she just had a very, ""i don't care"" attitude and now after spending $35 i get to go home and cut my daughter's hair again and try to fix my own. never coming here again!"
"you gotta go see landree! he is the best hair stylist/barber i have ever been to. this guy is the real deal, seriously! have you ever felt like a million bucks because of a haircut? i have. do you know why???? because of landree. he should travel the country to teach other hair stylists how to cut hair. the man is basically a magician with hair. it's unbelievable. i hope he never retires. that's how incredible he is. he's the whole enchilada. he's the bees' knees."
"i had no idea how to explain what i wanted when i walked in, but within a few minutes of talking to the lady, she knew exactly what i wanted with a jumbled words i was trying. very fun to talk to, unfortunately didn't get her name. 10/10 would recommend."
"very professional lady she did a great fade after i screwed up the back of my head, and the gentlemen that work there was very nice and helpful, the store is clean and they have a great selection of product, definitely recommend this place"
such friendly staff.  fast and grateful to talk to.  this was my first time and i will be back!
"this supercuts is a great place to get a haircut! landree and the other stylists are always friendly and professional. they are easy to talk to, they listen to your needs, and they don't use aggressive sales tactics to get you to buy expensive shampoo! i recommend this salon to anyone looking for a good haircut at a reasonable price!"
well since my last review was removed very unprofessional!! i got my hair colored and highlighted and was told by the stylist if i was unable happy to come back. i came back in 4 days to have more highlights put in front and she recharges me..so color and highlights cost 85 +45=130 and im still not happy...i'll never be back!! take an honest review down shame on u....
"went in in this evening . the lady cutting my hair either had a plane to catch or was genuinely not interested. didn't even let me say a word on what was wrong with the haircut , took the cover off and went and stood at the cash register . maybe it was just a coincidence or an example of absolutely unsatisfactory service . i don't care much , just that i have to spend another 20 to get a haircut the way i want but this time wont repeat this mistake ."
"just went in for a quick trim.  waited a couple of minutes for a stylist to be available, but it was early and they had only been open for about 30 minutes when i got there.  i was greeted right when i walked in and they let me know it would be a couple of minutes - so i was fine waiting.my hair stylist was very friendly and did exactly what i wanted her to do with just trimming off the bottom ends of my hair so that i can grow out the layers i once decided were a good idea.overall: agood for a quick trim and service was friendly!"
"desperate for a haircut i came in about an hour before closing- i double checked to make sure this wasn't too late for me to get a trim and my layers cut. i was told ""a haircut is a haircut"". that's reassuring, good to know you don't think haircuts differ at all in time. this woman with short red hair(pixie cut) came over and showed me to to my seat- her breath reeked of cigarettes. i told her i wanted to keep my length- light layers- and a frontal bang. she did the worst haircut i have ever received in my life- and this is not an exaggeration. my hair went from the middle of my right below my collar bone. that's not layering that's doing a sh*tty cut because you want to go home. and i am particularly attached to my hair/ it takes a while for it to grow. i started crying in the chair and my hair fell to the floor. she looked at me and rudely asked if i had ever had layers before as if i was stupid. i told her i'd had em all my life but they never looked like this. she kept none of the length. and her complete lack of compassion and customer service at the fact that i was obviously upset. she held no conversation- asked how my day was or anything. a girls hair is very important and now i have to spend the next few months wearing a ponytail. i will never be back & i wish the store owner was there so they could see that directly."
"start: 11:04 : opens door, walks in.11:05 : seated , introductions, hair cut starts 11:09 : paid, walking out door ! effin a ! this is the in & out of hair cut joints ! do i like my cut - yes. is it fancy schmancy ? nope, its just a regular guys hair cut! short, clean and simple.total time saved compared to joya spa - 1 hr, money saved - 50 $ ! totally worth it, going back next month ! woot woot ! more money to buy things i dont really need!"
"disappointed with the service i received from carrie today. she was unwelcoming and displayed a ""cold"" attitude towards me and her own co workers. bad representation of the company. i won't be returning."
"walked in, received horrible service so, walked out. what nasty looking stylists. i'll never return. try zara salon next door. i see donna now."
"i gave one star bc i had to. i have never in my life been to such an unprofessional place in my life.  i'll spare the name of my ""stylist"" but why, idk. bottom line is, if you can't cut hair right, don't cut someones hair!!  i'll stick to letting the professionals at honeycomb organic hair salon  do my cutting from now on. how hard could it possibly be to trim bangs?! they're already parted shaped! my bangs look disgusting and i'm not going to let that hack job try to fix them. bs!"
cain was amazing. my regular hair person is out on maternity leave so i decided to come give this place a try. cain knew exactly what to do based on the other person's instructions and gave me a perfect haircut.  very professional place and the price is great.
"so i really can't explain how amazing my hair cut was that i just got yesterday. i paid 16$ for a regular hair cut and walked out with something worth at least 100$. go to the cute, thin bleach blonde guy with fringe hair cut and some tattoos (i cant remember his name im so sad). edit: found his name, cain. go to cain!!! i'm seriously not joking this is the best hair cut i've ever gotten. it is a long bob with layers and i feel like selena gomez. seriously, i'm obsessed and i would go back here just to see him every time but i was only in town for the weekend and my friend and i decided to do something crazy with our hair (chop it off). best haircut of my life. i will re-comment on this once i get his name from calling when they open. but if you are reading this, you are amazing and you need to be working in the best salon in scottsdale."
fantastic haircut from cain. he always does a great job. everyone was very nice and friendly. very helpful to select appropriate style and products.
"absolutely ecstatic with my cut, color and highlights! i haven't allowed anyone to touch my hair in 20 years! amari came highly recommended, so i took a chance (you can imagine what my hair looked like after so long without professional attention)!  she did an amazing job! she was very very knowledgeable on all the latest techniques, and suggested all the right products for long term use. love the cut! love the color! and it feels great too! she has a client for life !!!!"
"totally awesome haircut by gavin!   he also made very helpful recommendations for hair products for both my son and i.  gavin is professional and cool.  my sons hair isn't easy to cut, as it's curly with lots of calic - he took his time and gave him best cut of his 6 yr old life.    we will be back to see these guys again!"
"called ahead to put my name down,  they quoted the time, the stylist was awesome,  i totally forgot her name, but she has an owl tattoo!  so there,  now you can find her!seriously though,  she listened,  had great suggestions for my thick curly hair. my next visit will be color! i love my haircut!"
hey everyone thank you so much for the reviews. keep them coming. :). and just as a reminder if you'd like a career with supercuts. please apply atwww.supercuts.com
"guided here to gavin through the divine magic of yelp, i wasn't disappointed. gavin got me in right away for a trim on my bleached-to-death white hair. he asked me about how i wear and style my hair, adding a few touches to the overall shape to make things easier in the mornings. while i was adamant about visiting gavin for my first visit to supercuts, i'd definitely work with any of the other stylists i met in the future. this was my first haircut under $80, and i won't ever be priced-gouged like that again!"
"gavin is a rockstar, after three cuts he had it down and all i do is sit and he goes to work. good guy to small talk with too. 6 stars from me"
"i hate getting my hair cut...i was pleasantly surprised, that i made a check in and was put in a chair right away.  gavin took the picture i had and made it look just like it but still left a little wiggle room just in case i really didn't want to cut too much :)  well, after starting to go to the gym and summer coming on i really needed more cut and andrea did rest i love this place!  i have had non-stop compliments on my hair."
"i've tried toni & guy twice over the last 5 years, otherwise had a friend cut my hair. it was time to get a professional cut again and i figured i'd try supercuts in my neighborhood.i had no prior experience with supercuts but would have expected from hair salons in the past:- that they'd wash my hair before cutting, not use a water spray bottle- that it takes more than 10 minutes to cut and trim hair that hadn't been cut in 6 months.- that they'd offer a mirror to see the back when asking if it looked ok.- that they'd dry my hair!!!!i left the store with my hair wet and combed back. no idea what i'd look like.when i got home and dried it, the left ear had a strand of hair an inch longer than the right.the back wasn't layered and all kinds of uneven hairs were flipping and sticking out.wound up taking scissors and ""fixing"" it myself.while friendly and inexpensive, i would not use them again."
"i went into supercuts after 2 years of not cutting my hair because i had a very short pixie cut and the stylist that cut my hair made me go home crying. i don't if she's new, but she asked another stylist andrea how to cut my bangs (side swept with some pieces falling to the front) and she disregarded what her superior told her and in result left me looking like a porcupine because the bangs were beyond short. when i questioned it, she just used my hair needing to be trained as an excuse. although that was true, there's no way could train the baby hairs she made. not only did she totally ignore that i wanted some pieces created in the front but she cut my length twice as short as what i told her to. my hair was below my bottom and now it's barely below my shoulders. she even asked me twice and i had told her multiple times before i actually sat down, so i was confused as to why it was so short. the only other explanation was that she had probably messed up. she left the layers i asked for looking like really badly places extensions and not natural looking at all. i'm going to have to wear my hair up in a pony tail for the rest of the year. after she was done i was hoping someone else would do my waxing, but that wasn't the case. so after not saying anything about the hair because after all it is hair and it grows back, i was completely done when she spilled wax in my eye. she just said, ""oops haha, it just fell right off"" not even getting a real apology. so after being there for almost 2 hours, without the store not being busy, i wasn't impressed. my husband cuts his hair there all the time and they do an awesome job, so for that i won't give them a one star. i guess it's just that one employee, so if you ever get a stylist with pink and blonde hair, glasses, and smells like smoke, be sure to request someone else unless you want bad service or want to end up looking like edward scissorhands gave you a haircut."
"i called in ahead of time for roxy.  gavin answered my call & told me roxy was busy at the moment; but would be available within the hour.  i arrived almost to the hour; i was greeted by roxy, i only waited about 5 minutes.  roxy, took her time discussing my haircut & color and made suggestions.  my cut & color came out awesome.  i feel really comfortable with her.  gavin is awesome too!  they both really enjoy making you feel at home; which means a lot to me."
"i found this location near my house using yelp, and was impressed by it's great reviews. i don't usually use supercuts for myself but decided to try it as i needed a quick haircut before leaving on vacation. i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of haircut and service i received! i had andrea and she was efficient, courteous, and did a great job with my long hair. i'm pretty particular about keeping my length but she offered great advice and guided me in right direction for a simple but great cut. i'm very happy with the results and will be returning again!"
"....my hair looks fine, but i swear to god the young lady cutting it was intentionally jabbing me with the sheers."
"stopped in for a haircut and color. the staff is very nice and the girl that cut, colored and styled my hair did an awesome job. they are just as good here as a salon you might pay twice as much at. so glad i stopped in."
"stopped in today for a quick trim between running errands. amanda did a fabulous job on my pixie cut and i appreciated her positive, upbeat service.  overall, a good salon for a quick, inexpensive cut for only $15."
"the staff here is great very friendly and always greeted with a hi & smile! i get my brows done by jessica she is the master of brows! the salon is clean and professional,wait time is good not too long.they carry a variety of hair products from paul mitchell,redken,matrix,tigi,etc. go in and see them for a great hair cut,color and waxing!!!!"
"nothing to rave about, but certainly worth the money they were charging. they are often busy, which means i have to wait up to an hour to get my hair cut."
"i love my new hair, new color. kalimah was the only one working when my mom and i came in. she did an awesome job for both of us. we will definitely come back!!!"
"outstanding and friendly service!i have been to this location twice now and this is now my spot for trimming up the old mop on my head... my first time in i had the really small mexican girl who doesn't talk a lot but is literally the most amazing person i have ever witnessed cutting hair with mostly all scissors in my life! she is so fast and accurate it is something to see! i don't recall her name, but she has skills and was polite! this week i returned for round two and the other girl wasn't there. so i tried a new girl who was also great. i of course don't remember her name either but her mother is from jamaica and she is super friendly. she did a great job on my hair as well. all in all my 2 trips in here were outstanding!"
"i came in probably about 1:30p on friday. i seen two stylists with clients however i was greeted right away by savannah as i waddled (7 months expecting) to the computer to be checked in. i must mention that no one has touched my hair in years! color and cut. my hair ran down my back and when i came in i was determined to go really short! so i was really nervous when i just decided to come in after work and get my wavy locks cut. savannah was extremely friendly while checking me in. asked for my name and phone number and what services i will be needing. i explained i was nervous due to the request of what cut i was wanting, a long bob. but assured me i will be taken care of shortly.the other stylist finished rather quickly, walked with her client to the front and checked him out then began her duties of cleaning. savannah didn't take long to finish with her client then i was next..savannah was very knowledgeable and gave me great detail as to what she would be doing before we began. she kept up a great conversation and offered the blow dry service so i can see the finish outcome and how it can be styled. this store was very clean, stylists were professional and it was great pricing."
"first time ever trying supercuts. i was so excited because they stay open till 6 pm on sunday. i drove 9 miles to get there and arrive 10 minutes before closing. the sign in the window says ""open"". a lady name natalie said they have two customers ahead of me and they can't except me. i don't think i'll ever be back to supercuts, very disappointed. not used to a business that turns away customers during the hours they show they are still open."
"my experience here is a joke. i was super early for a movie so i stopped by to get a haircut. i was greeted immediately by vivian who took me back after getting all my info, and she asked me what i wanted. i told her i wanted a trim and layers, because i've been growing out my hair and i've been pretty bored with it. she asked me where i wanted the shortest layer and i said i wasn't sure, and asked what she thought. her response was, ""it's up to you."" well....yes, i know that, but what kind of stylist can't even give professional opinions, especially when asked? she took scissors and cut an inch off my hair, used the same scissors to do one swipe down the hair on either side of my face for my 'layers' and literally, that was it. seriously -- my cut couldn't have taken more than five minutes. she didn't even make sure the layers were even. whatever. my hair doesn't look any different, so it could be worse, but man, what a bummer. from now on, i'll go somewhere else for professional opinions and some personality from the person cutting my hair."
i took my 6yr old for a simple cut. i just wanted four inches taken off the length. at the place the girl did a dry cut which i didn't think anything of. well we get home and after a shower i'm brushing her hair and it's completely lopsided. worst haircut ever.
"i love my cut , root touch up and highlights by maxine.  stopped by supercuts after the stylist from a groupon i purchased was a no show and maxine filled the void.  everything happens for a reason.  i'm happy i got stood up and found maxine."
this is the 3rd time i've been to supercuts and i always leave satisfied.i have thick short hair and it's a pain to maintain it. i'm very picky with who touches my hair. my hair stylists has been claire (sorry if i misspelled the name) .. she is amazing! she knows how to clean up my hair without taking too much length off.i recommend and trust her
"their website shows $12.95 for kids cut and also $12.95 for seniors over 62. so i take my daughter and my father to get haircuts. the haircuts could have been better and the staff there are unfriendly and unenthusiastic - fine whatever. i get to the register and all of a sudden the price is $14.50 for my kid and $16.50 for my dad. when i asked why the prices are different on the supercuts website my reply was: ""they took those prices away last week"". ya, right. f--- you and your f------ store. goodbye."
"great haircuts and coloring and waxing!!the hair professionals know what to do!  very witty, personable and helpful.our family drives past many other salons on our way to this particular supercuts for a reason!!"
"came to this supercuts because it was close to my work and i wanted a trim all my ends off they were getting really gross and just not attractive looking. the lady who helped me listened to want i wanted and kept my length, and the other lady ( sorry i don't know the names) helped cut my hair. my hair is healthier and still kept my length and more layers. i love how it looks. definitely recommend this location the ladies know what they are doing !"
"i came to this location the other day with my daughter to get hair cuts. i explained that my hair was so long, thick and that it was getting too complicated to keep up with the military appearance since the bun was getting too big. i asked for a pretty basic hair cut, i would think... to cut three inches, straight across my back and to thin it out. when straightened my hair the next day, i realized that i had a lot of random chunks of hair that was longer than the actual cut. i had to have my husband cut the obvious parts until i could take some leave to get another hair cut. this is kind of the last thing i wanted to worry about. sometimes attention to detail can go a long way."
"if i could give this experience of -5 i would. i wear my hair pretty short and i went in there and showed a picture to the girl that cut my hair and told her i wanted it cut just a little bit shorter than that picture because i have to get it cut too often and before i could say anything she took clippers and went up the back of my head. cutting it almost to my scalp.  i had been explaining to her what a bad year it been.. i've had 3 surgeries, my mom and dad both passed away and i was so looking forward to my birthday coming up that weekend because i hadn't been out much in the last year due to medical and i had to cancel my birthday party because she basically shaved my head. i'm not a confrontational person and i was extremely upset and i did not want to cry so i just paid her and left. i called the manager to explain the whole thing to her i sent her before picture and after  picture i was promised not only to get my money back but that i would hear back from the manager and that still has not happened so i will never ever go here again. luckily i am on medical leave and don't have to leave my house.  i put a hoodie on to walk my dog because i'm so embarassed of my hair ( or lack thereof).."
"i wish i could remember the name of the lady that cut my hair.  it was the fastest, better looking haircuts i have ever had.  she didn't try to make small talk, which i really appreciated.  she cut my hair in about 7 minutes flat!"
terrible haircut. she took only about 10 minutes to cut my hair and it looked uneven. i then told her and she said that's just the way my hair was. now i have to go back to get it fixed. i would never pay any amount to get my hair cut there again.
"usually take a chance with other supercuts..but this place was clean, modern, and most importantly i got a great haircut.  darci totally listened to what i wanted and did it quickly and beautifully.  went late morning monday..no wait..and the best $15.00 haircut.  next time, plan on taking advantage of their color."
"went here last week to find they had totally remodeled the place.  lookin' good supercuts! again, sara saved the day, color and cut and making me lovely to look at once again.  new color dye burns a little more than the old stuff, but the color is amazing!  go!  you know you wanna look good!  just go!no, they don't take appointments!"
"great staff, great customer service, great hair cuts!  the experience is as wonderful as the cut. they really took the time to understand and cut my hair the way i wanted it done. wow! -keep up the great work team."
"i always get so nervous when finding a good hair dresser! i don't like when i sit in someone's chair and they tell me what i want or what they think is best for me! but what i really hate is when i go in for a trim and come out 4 inches shorter :/ i also don't want to pay $50 for a hair trim. i was extremely lucky to have colene take care of me! i was very picky asking if she can cut my hair dry, i just know that's what works for me. i was okay if it couldn't be done but i could just tell i could trust her, she definitely knew what she was doing! colene was so friendly about all my crazy request! i have been growing my hair out for years now and i just needed to be sure it didn't get messed up. i am beyond happy with super cuts and this location. i paid $17 for a trim. but i was also surprised to see they do waxing and color! this is my new spot for my hair and eyebrows :)"
"i got a really great haircut from kelsey 3 mos ago and so i returned 3 mos later for another.  she wasn't as enthusiastic as last time and left me with nothing short of loss for words. two other stylists picked up that i was not happy with the cut and made me feel better immediately.  cassandra and nicole rescued me and reassured me i wasn't leaving until i got the cut i wanted and was happy. thank you , thank you , thank you girls for making my day. you are the definition of customer service. i understand we all have bad days so i wasn't mad or anything at kelsey i was in fact a little disappointed,  but no big deal. this location has great stylists. i will be back."
"i walked in for a cut and color around 3:40pm last friday, and i am so happy with my hairdresser cassandra! she did a phenomenal job and just knows what to do in regards to mixing the colors (i showed her a photo for reference) and trimming where it needed to be, which was 8 inches, so glad that i did! i felt a bit bad, cassandra had to stay after hours to finish up deep conditioning/shampoo/cut. she was very patience and i did not feel rushed at all! thank you again! :)"
"got a great trim and style while here on vacation. the male stylist was great, i forgot to get his name. i was in a hurry to make a portrait shot with my family. i totally recommend this place if you need a cut or style on a sunday."
"robyn nicole is amazing!!! she listens and pays so close attention to every little detail. she totally gets it!!! she is fun, spunky and most of all the sweetest person ever!!! i love, love, love my hair and will continue to come back. in fact,  i don't see myself going to anyone else.... she is perfect in every way."
"robyn is the best! i just moved to arizona from la and have had some pretty fancy hairdressers. she is so patient, creative and really works with me on my vision of my hair. i always leave happy and w hair better than i could of thought up by myself."
"beware! i was just charged $45 for an awful braid, and didn't even wash my hair. i had her redo it once and then just said i liked it so i can go home and redo it. the woman seemed very inexperienced as she made my hair look nothing like the picture i showed her. it took three people to figure out how to ring me up. never going back!"
"just left this place feeling like a new woman! colene is amazing. she listened to what i needed and delivered that and more. my hair feels so much healthier and manageable. she made me feel relaxed and i had a good time chatting with her. she wasn't pushy about selling any products but made some awesome recommendations. i bought the olive oil shampoo and conditioner along with the super skinny serum which i am super excited to use. the online check in was easy and efficient. the hours and days this location is open is so convenient! great experience from the online check-in, to walking out the door. thank you, colene and supercuts, for probably the best hair cut i have ever experienced!"
"i went there to get highlights for my hair. joshua was very helpful. he listened carefully to what i wanted, and recommend exactly what would suit me and my hair type. the results turned out to be amazing. i decided to get a haircut as well. joshua helped me tame my voluminous, thick hair by giving me the right amount of layers, while still maintaining the length of it. it was a very good first experience for me. everyone working in the salon was very nice and pleasant. what i loved the most was that joshua answered all my questions very patiently."
really slow and not great haircut this evening. she worked on my hair for over an hour and never was able to really get what i was telling her i wanted. now that i know which one she is i will avoid her in the future. don't have a name because she didn't have a cosmetology license displayed at her station. normally this place is great but the lady who cut my hair this evening was a disaster.
"new to the area and needed someone to fix a haircut that went wrong.  stopped in and joshua was available right away to help me.  super friendly, professional and he fixed my botched haircut! definitely recommend!"
"i came to supercuts for color a few years back as an emergency as i used to go to expensive high end salons but could not get in. i came in for color and it was the best service i ever received. i have been coming back for my color ever since. i am always complimented on my color. gavin, robin and joshua are great!!"
hey guys. we also have a review system called my salon listens. that is sent to your email after a service. don't let all yelp reviews push you away from coming into our salon. :)  always working harder to improve and to deliver the best services. we welcome you in again. or if you're new we would be pleased to have you become part of our family.
this place is solid for a quick haircut that isnt gonna set you back 30 dollars for someone that gets their haircut twice a month 15 dollars a trip isnt so badif you want a good haircut then tell them how you like it- they stylists ive had have always been very receptive and talkative to keep me entertained
"ok, i'm done. done i tell you. i cannot get a consistent haircut from these folks. my hair is simple. number 3 on the sides, trimmed on the top, kinda ""boxy"" style, and not a uniform buzz cut. i only have one cowlick at the crown of my noggin. these past 3 times, i tell the lady my simple hair cut. i have had to return later in the day or the next day to get all the straggler hairs, the uneveness, and basically my whole head re-cut. and they don't even get that right. they just run the clippers over it to even it out and i leave with a standard buzz cut. but this last chance was the last straw. the same lady, whom i dreaded seeing when i walked in and she said ""come on back"" was free and thus was going to cut my hair. she spent an inordinate amount of time cutting my hair, using all types of fancy scissors and giant plastic pitchfork looking things, but mostly spent the 45 minutes talking and really....not focusing on cutting my hair. when she was finished, i immediately noticed again, how she did not even bother to trim my cowlick. when i pointed it out to her, she says ""i'm not finished, i just wanted you to see how it looks so far""...malarky! she then got out the clippers and basically gave me a very, very, very uneven buzz cut. and....the past 3 cuts from her, i still have all the scraggly hairs above and behind my ears that i just trim when i get home!since i left with it so short, i would have been pointless to get it corrected....that would just entail me shaving my head myself. so i'm going to listen to my wife and go to a barber or pay a little more at a salon or just go shaggy. i know it's only 15 bucks, but my hair is not that complicated and i guess i just expected a decent haircut every once in a while. but 3 in a row....the fool is me."
"super cheap, nice people, and i was in and out with a new cut. whats there to complain about?"
i love billi at supercuts.  i have been coming to her store for almost a year now.  my hair has never been healthier.  i color my hair and billi has done an incredible job with my color and style.    i have been tpo the expensive 'scottsdale salons' and have walked out very unhappy.   she is pleasant and fun to talk to. the price is great and the service is excellent!
"kisha is a well seasoned stylist who not only understands hair but listens as well!  i loved that she didn't fill the time in her chair with pointless chatter as much as her pointed attention on how i requested my hair cut. she has such a natural sense- didn't take me right to the shampoo bowl but actually cut my hair mostly dry to watch it react to what she was doing it's been painstaking to find a stylist and a positive experience getting my hair done. bottom line is, i don't want the a-line you cut, i want the a-line that works with my cow licks and waning hairline like i communicated. :) thanks k!  you understand where it starts, listening."
"we went here and ask for how long , the reciptionist say 10' waiting and after 15' wait i went to ask her ( cause i see her take couple people in ) she tell me to wait other 20' cause she have appoint them came ? what the hell she told me cause she didn't know appointments will came in ? omg  ...."
"they close at 7 i came in at 645 there was 2 barbers and only 1 person waiting but they ""didn't have enough time to do my hair"" i get it shaved. this place doesn't like to make money or cut hair"
"i was skeptical to come here because they butchered my hair in april 2015, but i wanted to give them a second chance. the woman who cut my hair did an amazing job! she made my hair look amazing! definitely will be coming back again."
"i showed up early for my appointment and waited until my appointment time. the stylist instead took a walk in. i explained that scheduled clients should get priority over a walk in, but they obviously don't undersrtand how appointments work at this location. extremely frustrating as i've spent the past 10 days in the hospital with a loved one and i tried to take 30 minutes away for myself. this was such a huge waste of my time."
love coming here to get my haircut. jason always pays attention to details and does a great job.   i always look great when he cuts my hair. i strongly recommend you ask for him.
i always have a good experience. if you use the app to check-in you will not have to wait very long. have been using this store for about six years with no problems.
"we've been going here since this location opened, and we'd never had a bad experience until today. my wife has psoriasis on her scalp, and it's noted on her account. every time we go, they say something about dandruff. read the notes, please, it's not dandruff! then today, the girl at the front desk told her she couldn't cut her hair today, because her scalp was irritated. she wasn't rude about it, but she was loud, and instead of reading the notes on the account, she advised my wife that she should see a doctor about it. thanks for the kind suggestion."
"i've been waiting for 15 minutes for the store to open and still nobody has shown up. the hours posted say 9am, and it is now well after 9."
"another great cut!  this place has the nicest people.  music needed to be a little more upbeat, but hey, i'm there for a haircut, not a concert."
not the best by far. i am going to stick to my location over at camelback .
"why do employees have to be rude! this place was terrible from the first time i stepped in. it was as though i was bothering them. they were slow at cutting hair, unprofessional and i would not recommend them based on my personal experience."
"i wish there was an option for 0 stars, cuz they don't even deserve one. we checked in and told them we had two people, and seeing as there was two of us standing there, i don't see how that would be so difficult to understand. 15 minute wait, not bad. wandered around, came back, i came up to the counter and the guy walked away, not a word, just turned his back on me and left. a little irritated, i turned on my heel and walked out, decided to try again in a few minutes. we come back in and the nice lady at the counter asked for our names, (unintentionally?) makes fun of my boyfriends name, and tells me that since the first idiot never asked for my name, i had to wait behind the other 5 people that came in after me. livid. guess you get what you pay for."
"i went to get my haircut today. for the past several months i have been growing out my mustache and my hair. i now have a great handlebar mustache and my hair has begun to feather back nicely. i told the gentleman i was looking for a haircut to match my mustache, a longer hairstyle. i told him i wanted it a bit shorter on the sides and longer up top. he spun me around to show me a couple of pictures of men with buzz cuts. i said no, *much* longer. i mean come on, my hair was feathered back! so he nods like he knows what i'm talking. before i know it, he's using clippers on my hair! i say loudly (to be heard over the clipper) that he's cutting my hair too short! he smiles, nods and proceeds to buzz cut my hair!i'm shocked at this point! who would buzz cut feathered back hair without telling the customer??? i let the gentleman know again that he is cutting my hair too short. again with the stupid grin and nod. again with the complete disregard to what i'm saying. and he buzzes away my hair. my wife could hear me from across the salon. she's telling my daughter that i'm not happy, because she can hear my complaints. he cut off well over four inches of hair from the sides and back! i stopped him at this point and i remind him of what i asked for. just a bit shorter on the sides, not short! he tries to tell me that he misunderstood. i remind him that i well saying it's too short. several times. he ignored me. in the end, he finished my haircut and offered his apologies. the haircut itself looks presentable with enough product in it. i hate wearing product in my hair. although the haircut is presentable, it is not what i asked for. i remind the gentleman that i will now have to wear his apology for months, until my hair grows back out. do not get your hair cut here, unless you want someone else to decide how they're going to cut your hair. the stylist (vietnamese gentleman) does not listen!"
"went in yesterday to get my hair cut for summer.i waited for an hour , when the wait time was 20 minutes when i showed up and the girl was rude. i asked for an angled bob and they cut my hair without even doing the finger test to see if it was too short. after it was cut, i heard to late to go back and now i have a haircut that barely pulls into a ponytail like i asked for and short sides which i did not ask for. i used to go here all the time and this will be the last time."
"first time reviewer... because of my frustration during this visit.the benefit of places like super cuts and great clips is that, while they may not have the best stylists, it is usually possible to quickly get in or out.  while visiting relatives, i stopped in to get a haircut and was told there would be 35 (seemed pretty precise) minute wait. there were three people in the lobby waiting on haircuts.  at this point i had an hour before i needed to leave for dinner so i decided to wait.after waiting for 30 minutes a dad and his two sons arrived.  one stylists took the dad, and i assumed he had a call-in appointment.  i was slightly irritated that they did not tell me there were three call-in appointments, as i doubted this gentleman would get his hair cut in 5 minutes. i didn't want to spend those thirty minutes waiting for nothing; however, i should have considered the sunk cost of my time. the second stylist took a person that was previously in the lobby. when the first stylist was finished with the father he took the second son.  even though it had been nearly an hour i was thinking, ""at least i'm next in line for the stylist that is taking lobby patrons.""  at nearly exactly the one hour mark the dad walked over to me and apologized, as he had noticed my long wait.  as i assumed, they had booked appointments over the phone.  i informed him that i was not upset with him at all, but what a nice gesture. the stylists did not inform me of this, the customer did.  the second stylist finished with her lobby patron and move on to... the third son. at this time (an hour and 15 minutes into my wait). my wife gave up waiting for me to pick her up, and started walking to this location from the nearby mall.  i informed my family that i would be very late for dinner.i finally was called back. no ""thank you for waiting, no sorry for your wait, no explanation that they had to serve the call-in customer first,"" nothing. as i got my hair cut in silence, the stylist pinched my neck in the apron snap.  i couldn't hold back a small yelp of pain.  no apology.  silent hair cut continues.  usually a stylist will slap his or her comb against my forehead multiple times during a haircut.  truly a testament to their speed as they switched from collecting strands to cutting said strands.  this stylist got me right in the eyeball with the comb's teeth. another small yelp of pain.  no apology. i finally finished my haircut.  a total of 12 words... jason, how you like it?, this short?, strong hair, coupon?, and twenty dollars"" were spoken from the time i sat down to the time i left.  i was offered 3, $2 off coupons. not only would i not return once, i would not return three times for sure. because i am not one to complain with no solutions in mind, here is how this location could have salvaged this situation, and should treat future (not me) customers. know the schedule for those customers that have called in an appointment so that you do not tell someone 35 minutes, then leave them waiting for ~1 hour and 20 minutes before they see a stylist.  if this egregious breakdown occurs, promptly inform the customer of your error and provide him or her of his new wait time, so he can make an informed decision whether he wants to continue to wait or cut his losses.  if the customer decides to wait, acknowledge the customer's wait and apologize for wait.  on final suggestion, please take the ""walk-ins welcome"" sign off your window."
prices just went down on color
"i got my hair cut there last week. its a great place with awesome customer service. stephen cut my hair and it looks awesome definitely recommend him, he gave me exactly what i asked for."
"good color, good stylists, and good conversations, it's hard to trust anyone with my hair, but stephen does amazing work! he's worked some magic, i definitely will return!!!!!!!!"
"clean,  very spacious,  amazing stylists! i'd definitely recommend this place for your next cut, color, or style.  definitely check this place out."
"meh - this location is great because it is centrally located in tempe and easily accessible if you live on or near campus. the stylists are often inexperienced and unprofessional however. i would say this is a average location for supercuts, at best. expect a wait and know exactly what you want, since the stylists aren't great at helping you make a decision. this location would do better if they had more stylists and could reduce their turnover."
"supercuts seems pretty good that it's close to campus. unfortunately i had an unhappy experience. called ahead prior to closing and asked if they had room and what time they closed. they said they stay open until 7pm and that they had a 2min wait. i call a lyft to get there prior to closing and come through the door only to be told that they don't have room to fit me in. i arrived exactly 30 minutes prior to closing and got there within 10 minutes of calling them.ended up wasting $5 to get out there. i wish the staff would've said something over the phone as opposed to giving misinformation.case in point, if you call in be weary of the info they give you."
"i got my haircut yesterday from a great lady. while i can't remember her name, she did the very common ""white boy"" haircut.. common blend from a low 1 to a high 3, with a pompadour haircut up top. she blended it and helped even out all of the inconsistencies i was having in my hair and with previous barbers. definitely coming back!"
i never give reviews but i had exceptional service with alexandra. she went above and beyond with my haircut. she not only gave me a good haircut in what i asked for but gave me a lot of advice in how to take care of my hair. i appreciate that sooo much. thank you!
went to supercut at rural and university cornerstone many times and i prefer alexandria when i make the appointment there.she is very particular when cutting hair and i like that  ..you  will know the difference if u give her a shot you will see! guys and gals ....
"just had one of the best haircuts ever! enjoyed conversation with darcy and team, fun place to get a cut. thanks guys! great haircut too, best i've had in awhile as well."
"wouldn't let me 8 year son use their bathroom, will never go here for haircut...,..ccxxxxxxxx cxxxxxxx."
"please don't make the mistake i did and go here just because you see some (somehow perfect) 5 star reviews. i imagine those reviews were ""bought"" somehow. i went here after work today and had a terrible experience. i wanted about an inch off (i had very long hair) and now it is above my shoulder with sloppy layers (some so short they are probably 2 1/2 inches in length). i will own up to my own error in this, as i agreed to a shorter cut but not this short as i explicitly said below the shoulder and was very reluctant about the layers.furthermore, i've always been outspoken about what i call ""hair salon bullying"". this is a hair stylist belittling your current style/color in order to sell you a color or cut they envision for you (and potentially so they can make more $). ""what is that crazy bleach job you have going on?"" ""so the last person who cut your hair, they obviously didn't know what they were doing, did they?"" my stylist did all of the above, making me feel like, ""oh nice, so you're telling me i've been walking around looking like sh*t the last few months..."" it puts me in a vulnerable place and i want to hear the professional's opinion. however, that said, i took her advice and went shorter than i planned but it still did not come out as promised which was supposed to be longer than shoulder length. and the layers are so inconsistent, choppy, and poorly done that a friend asked me if i had a mullet in the front. just horrible. stay away!"
"don't go. they will butcher your hair. the employee turnover is crazy. you will never see the same person twice. only go if it's your last resort. seriously, the people here have no experience or commitment to the hair styling industry. they do it in the side to further their actual careers (if any)"
"i was very dubious about going here since i saw on yelp the number of low reviews this location has but was in desperate need for a bang cut so i decided to go and take the chance. i got melanie (who i strongly recommend; she's very nice and listens to needs) and she took care of my bang cut perfectly per my needs! it's been a week since i got them cut here and i am happy with how it looks. now keep in mind this review is for a plain hair cut and not dramatic styling or hair color. for simple hair cuts or trims, this place seems perfectly capable and is convenient bc of its proximity to school ^o^ have no complaints here."
this place is terrible. it was my only night off and i called ahead to see if they could get me in. they told me it would be 15 minutes before i could get in. almost an hour later they still hadn't said a single word to me. thanks for wasting my only night off. i should have gone somewhere else. now i have to do it myself! just terrible. if you are understaffed and can't fit me in then fing tell me. don't make me waste my time! i am furious.
can someone please tell me why tammy took liberties with my child's hair?  i said a trim not to hack it & shape it without asking first.  she has curly hair that used to be allb one length.  she went crazy with the clippers to the ends.  my daughter's hair isn't what we wanted & we left with frizzy hair.
always get my hair cut here. don't try and get your eyebrows waxed. two times so far i've been denied. once i was told oh i don't know how and another time oh the wax isn't warm enough! if you offer a service it should be available or post times it is available.
first hair cut salon in arizona for me and i'd say it went wonderfully. no one ever gets personal and asks that many questions to make sure you got the hair cut you came asking for. i would highly recommend it. also try their green tea shampoo and conditioner. just ask them about it. you won't regret it. the price was decent but everything was to my liking.
rip off and bad service. $65 later and they sent me out the door without even fixing my hair. i have never been to a hair salon that doesn't dry and style your hair after you've paid an arm and a leg for a service.  horrible.
stopped by asu to visit the boy and took him for a long overdue haircut. we waited about 10 minutes and the haircut did the trick.
"my story goes like this.  i went in and requested a simple fade and explicitly requested that it be at medium height.  i even said ""don't give me a marine hair cut"".  i took off my glasses and don the cape, the women (who happened to be the manager) who was to cut my hair spun me away from the mirror and started to cut.  about 3 minutes later (yeah seriously 3 minutes!!!!! wtf) she stated she was finished, so i put my glasses back on to see what the finished product looked like.  how do you think she did, was she such a master that she could give a world class hut cut in record time?  nope!!!  she gave me a high and tight, seriously a damn hight and tight.  the one thing i asked her not to do she did, and the shit eating grin on her face said ""yeah i know what you said but i don't give a crap, i just want to get back to facebook"".  i was so pissed that i just bit my tongue and said nothing or else i'd have flipped out on this lady.  so, i get home and start to check out the magnum opus this picasso of hair styling had created and i find a huge, make that ridiculously huge chunk of hair the size of two thumbs uncut and sticking out from the rest of the disaster.  seriously wtf!!!!!!  i still to this day think she did that purposely because there's no way to miss some shit like that.  i get back in my car and return to the store, i politely wait for another stylist (even though the hair terrorist was free) to take me back and do some damage control.  i could tell she was having a hard time saving as much as possible because the blending was sooooo bad and uneven however, she did what she could and i appreciate that (oh she also told me that the hair terrorist doesn't know how to do fades correctly because she is classically trained or some crap).  this women knew she didn't have the skill set to cut my hair and put me in a booth anyways.  way to go supercuts, that's taking initiative, after all it's better to take someone's money once and not give them what they paid for so they'll never return than having them wait 10 minutes to get what they came for.  after this very pleasant and skilled young lady is finished fixing the debacle on my cranium i politely request a refund.  i actually shouldn't have paid for the hair cut in the first place but i wanted no drama.  nevertheless, i had to drive all the way back here to have someone do damage control so i was not feeling like i owned them any money for any of this fiasco.  of course i had to go through the hair terrorist to get said refund, and that went over like a fart in church.  it was obvious that she really really really did not want to refund my money, why, i have no clue.  after politely asking and explaining that the requested refund was based on principle, her retort basically amounted to the theory of using it to pay for the second haircut i got, yeah the one where they fixed what she jacked up in the first place.  she wanted to keep the money and transfer the ""credit"" to the other stylist.  seeing how as i was going to use the refund to tip the second stylist anyways and that by this time i was immensely annoyed with the hair terrorist and could handle no more of her crap i just agreed and left.moral of the story:  don't come here with any expectation because, apparently you don't need to know how to cut hair to work at this supercuts or for the matter to even manage the damn place.  to be fair though there is at least one talented individual working here."
"my best friend and i went in here on a sunday, fed up with mall prices. i had the best  hair cutting experience ever! loved the men cutting our hair, and it's the best cut i've had in years! p. s. get the tea tree oil treatment."
"bianca gave me the greatest joy by giving me a great haircut.  she knew what she was doing and cut to perfection.  that is rare for me to say.  i usually sign in online, but this time i was a walk in.  there was no wait time for me.  i highly recommend bianca if you go to this location.  i'm confident you will be as pleased as i am if she cuts your hair."
the guy that cut my hair was awesome!! he did a great job and was super friendly. the only reason this review is bad is because they didn't honor a coupon that apparently was only for another location. again not the fault of the employee but a bad policy of the company.
my family and i go to this super cuts a few times a month at times and always ask for amanda. one thing i appreciate about amanda is that she listens to you. i often ask for a trim at places and will get too much cut off :( but when i have visited amanda she hears me and cuts exactly what i asked for. my son and my daughter say the same thing. we have waited at times for amanda to be scheduled. :)
"very happy with my hair! i had a basic cut and then balayage color. amanda rocked it! she is super friendly, knows the importance of listening to her clients, and was accommodating to all my requests. great attention to detail and excellent price! the other stylists were friendly too, and did a great job with their clients from what i could tell because there were many happy regular customers. this supercuts is a winner! and i had no idea supercuts even did color, but i gave it a shot and will definitely be back to see amanda in the future."
"this is the worst haircut that ive had in my life. i told the hairdresses very simple instructions, even showed her a picture of my last haircut which was very simple, and still messed up my hair. its a girl with black hair with dyed hair on top. she is the worst! wont be going back there again"
"great supercuts.  i have been going to this location for at least 1 year now and have never had any problems or issues.  i always get my hair cut by the manager anthony which i am always pleased with.  the only down fall (it's not their fault) is sometimes the wait is long, but that should tell you they are good at cutting hair!"
"as a long time customer and a college student....i am a faithful customer....your rates are best one can find in the city....i just moved from san marcos, tx to san antonio.....after growing at my hair for a year i find cutting it hard...a man without his hair is like a women is who isnt pretty....that said going into a supercuts : i was completely dismayed.....while my hair was getting cut...my hair cutter was also cutting a little boys hair....i live in a classy part of san antonio and was recently invited to a ritzy party in downtown now i dont know if i can show my face....before the incident i looked like a respected individual ready for classes in two weeks....now i look like a punk with no hair going to the military....when i was receiving my hair cut i asked for my sides to be thinned not a mohawk..... if this is how you treat an individual much needs to be improved with your company and the faculty that represents you!....."
"it was fall time and i just moved here not too long ago, and my hair was practically to my waist. since my hair is very thick, it made me sweat a lot, and i wanted a change. i went in and the service was very friendly. i sat down and told her i just wanted it shorter, because my hair just makes me sweat and i hated it. maybe a pixie? a side cut?  i told her i didn't want anything near cutting to my shoulders, because i have a round face, and it looks so stupid when i have shoulder length hair. (picture a beach ball with a wig on.) i also told her i wanted a darker color. she said she didn't have time to dye it, and i would have to come back the next day 10 am. i told her never mind on the color, and just do the cut.  she did an under cut to my ears, and shortened my hair. i told her i also wanted front bangs, and she said straight bangs wouldn't look good with my face shape, so she gave me this weird side bang (which i hated afterwards) her co worker offered to color my hair since she was off soon. she brought out the color wheel, and i told her i didn't want anything red, since i have lots of red tones in my face. she showed me this beautiful dark brown/black with purple highlights, which wasn't overwhelming for work at all. and next to it was this red violet color. and she said ""this one suits you!"" i said it was a bit too red for my taste, and she said the red isn't that noticeable. so she dyed my hair. i was there for almost 3 hours. with my glasses off, i cant see whats going on, so she finishes it i put my glasses on and she turned me around. side bang, shoulder hair, and it was a dark red/burgundy color. i wasn't sure how to feel. i liked the undercut a lot. i paid 75 for everything. (which i'm never doing again) about a week later, i hated the hair color so much i ended up re-dying it back to a dark brown.the length has grown out, but i never wear it down, because it's too hot!i feel bad for not saying anything ( i think one of the ladies was still learning to cut hair), but i wont be coming back here."
i will never go back. i got my hair cut and was totally not happy. i went back 2 days later to get a redo and i'm still not happy.
this place is short staffed often only having one stylist even on saturdays. the stylist are often not well trained. the store has stayed in disrepair for several years.
store doesn't close until 8.employee didn't want to work so said they closed at 5... where does it say they close at 5 on a tuesday? nowhere!! lazy ass employee.wouldn't even come to the door to tell me why they were closed early
staff was not interactive. but stylist did a good job. overall satisfied with the service but could improve customer interaction skills. thanks to my gal for making me contribute to yelp.
"advertise to skip the wait by making an appointment online, well, the workers there do not know this... visited on saturday, 11/26/16, and made online appointment for 5:30pm.  i get there 10 minutes early, and the decide to take another customer before me.  then, a few minutes after my appointment, the girl cutting hair tells me that they are taking another customer because he got to the salon before i did...  what's the point on online apts if you're gonna pull this crap?  horrible!"
i think this is a great place for a quick and affordable haircut and style. i've been to this location on a few occasions and its always busy and there appears to be a number of regulars. this is our go-to place for my guy's haircut in between trims that i give him. i find the stylists i be nice and helpful and relatively fast. if you do not know what style you want i recommend that you do some homework first. they do have some style books but not many and you won't find tons of magazines in in the waiting area -- so bring something with you if you are waiting on someone -- but the wait is generally never over 30 min total unless you are in a peak time like saturday afternoon or back to school time.
i must say for a place to recieve so much traffic. one would think there should be more employees working here. i was told 30 minute wait but it has been 1 hour and 30 minutes. they forgot to mention customers call in instead if waiting so they come first. if thats the case then they need more hair dressors.
"this supercuts is great. very good customer service and even better cuts. i've been coming to supercuts ever since i was younger. they're always kind and greet you when you walk in the door. it's always best to call in ahead of time so that way when you get there, you don't have to worry about waiting 30-45 minutes for a cut. highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice haircut."
"came here a few days ago.  the place is a disaster.  it was at least 30 minutes wait before they took me in, considering that i reserved a time slot on line.  but that is just the tip of the issue.  there were only 2 individuals cutting hair.  they were not even cleaning up before the next customer is serviced.  they had everyone's hair scattered all over the floor.  it was disgusting.  it was late and i just went along with it.  i shouldn't have since my hair was cut by some 3rd rate stylist.  well, i'm not coming back here again."
they don't have enough stylists for the demand. they also don't notify you of your place in line. especially vs online checking. i sat waiting for over 40 minutes before being told that i was still behind 2 more people because of online check ins. this is not the way to do business. i'm going back to great clips.
"if you want a lazy and half assed cut, come here!i brought l my brother in for a haircut today and while waiting, we noticed the hair stylist clarissa, seemed very rude and unwelcoming while talking to other guests that walked in the door. unfortunately, that's who we got but we gave her the benefit and requested that she give him a fade with 2 on the sides and a 3 on top (realize that boy's hair grows extremely fast and we request the same thing every month and get the results we want). i also explained that my terminology may be wrong but i explained the look, short on the sides, and longer on top. she started cutting, and customers flocked in and i see her just buzz his entire head so then i go up to clarissa, already in awe at what she did and ask her to fade his hair, the least she can do after giving him a military cut, not what we asked for, she replies ""there's too many customers waiting."" i gladly gave her no tip, and not to mention, she had nails that were 2 inches long, not sure how she's cutting hair at all to begin with. save your kids the embarrassment at school, take them else where."
friday at 10:00 am.  for the 3rd time only 1 employee and long wait.  i dont know why this place is not staffed but i wont be coming to this location anymore.
very good experience here! everyone was nice and professional. my hair stylist was great! she did exactly what i wanted and i'm very pleased with the outcome.
"terrible customer service. went in had to wait 25 min for my son to get a hair cut, when it was my daughters turn the girl got up and went to lunch, without a saying a word, making me wait another 20 min to get her hair cut"
"when i walked in, everyone was cutting hair, but one of the stylists looked over and acknowledged me, so i took a seat. two other customers came after me, and she wholeheartedly greeted each of them, even ensuring they were put on the list. it was only myself and those two customers who came after me in the waiting area, so i feel i was outright ignored. i guess because i have a beard, it's okay to discriminate against me and ignore me. this is pathetic if you ask me and i'm glad i'm the first to review these racists. as soon as she took one of the customers ahead of me, i simply walked out. i don't have time to argue with these low-lifes. what goes around comes around!"
"the staff always does a great job.   very welcoming and courteous.   michelle usually cuts my hair and does an awesome job,but if she is booked up, the rest of the stylist on hand will always do a great job."
"5 stars! isis is a baller, ask for her! the staff here is consistent and good. i bring my son here at least twice a month and typically have isis cut his hair. every hairstylist here is good. isis is great. she is fast with kids which makes it easy on the kiddos attention span. her fades are quality top notch leaving no lines visable. i have had to use three other stylists for my son here. they all were good.tip: i call before i leave the house to get pur name on the list which takes you to the front of the line as soon as you walk in the front door. i think you can do this online too."
"see posted pic. this was taken before getting it fixed at another place. she trimmed so high above my ear. it was unprofessional. she didn't tell me she screwed up, so she could fix it. had a co worker point it out. thanks for that. this place is a chop shop."
absolute worst haircut i have ever had.  went to get hair trimmed for a wedding.  told the girl i would like long layers and just evened up a little.  she butchered my hair.  all different lengths and basically a short shag from the 70s !!  i just wanted to cry.  still do.  there is no way to fix it until it grows out.  it will be about 6 months.  the only reason i am giving them one star is to write a review.  this chop job is devastating.  im completely embarassed.  the girl that cut my hair should be fired.  i dont believe for one minute that she went to school to learn to cut hair.
went in as a last minute walk in. i needed my daughters hair cut for back to school and they were able to accommodate us immediately.  mallorie was friendly and really good with my daughter.  (age 6). i am definitely going back for myself and all my girls haircuts..
"crapercuts: what i asked for is not what i received. not even close. i asked for a shaped cut and even showed a picture, all i got was a buzz cut. my wife said i could do better myself and i have with my electric clippers from costco. don't be fooled by the advertisements or positive reviews. i am continually dissatisfied with this business chain.$14.99 wasted! i am will never visit this business chain again."
"i have short wavy hair, cut like halle berry. i tried four other salons ranging in price and amenities, and i couldn't get a good haircut in san antonio.then i drove by and thought i'd try this salon - out of desperation and with no expectations.  jeannetta was amazing.  i haven't had a haircut this good since i left miami years ago.  and when i found out how affordable it was, i almost fell out.  for what i paid for one hair cut at a previous place, i can get three haircuts here.   and it's a nice, clean shop in a great location.  i'll never go anywhere else in tx.thank you jeannetta. you were not only very proficient, but kind and fun to talk to."
"kortney always does an amazing job which is why i return regularly. i used to pay a lot more for haircuts and drive across town to get them because i assumed that meant better quality but she does my hair as well as any of them and is a lot more pleasant in addition to being conveniently located.the beard trims and shampoos are also great. the stylists are all very pleasant, which to me is at least as important as the skill. i recommend you go and ask for kortney (yes, spelled with a k).also, be sure to try to potato salad. it's pretty good."
"could be the worst haircut i have ever gotten. my regular lady is out of the country so emergency haircut it is. i went in the for a trim and shape and came out a new man. oh yeah, definitely a new man.  maybe they shouldn't hire people right out of beauty school"
this establishment processed an un-authorized over-charge on my credit card.  this stylist basically gave herself a higher tip.  i will never come back.
"edit: ever since isis and kourtney have left, the place has really gone down hill. horrible service!very friendly staff. awesome, inexpensive haircuts. i have been going since i moved to the area 1 1/2 yrs ago. location is perfect for the vast sea of houses in and around indian springs/evans area.  so you actually get to avoid the chaos that is 281."
"i arrived as they were opening,  there was no wait and the stylist greeted me with a smile.  the stylist did a great job making suggestions to style my hair and was very polite.  the haircut was great,  the shampoo awesome and the overall treatment very good. i think prior negative reviews may not be fair, i mean honestly...  i recommend it,  close home cheap and good service.  definitely planning on returning with my kids."
"beware!!!  i recently had my haircut at this location and the stylist absolutely ruined my hair.  for the next few months, i'm going to have to wear my hair pulled back in clips due to the fact that the sides don't even match up.  i would go back, but i'm afraid they would just make matters worse.   spend the extra money and go to a salon where the stylists actually care about their work."
"as a long time customer and a college student....i am a faithful customer....your rates are best one can find in the city....i just moved from san marcos, tx to san antonio.....after growing at my hair for a year i find cutting it hard...a man without his hair is like a women is who isnt pretty....that said going into a supercuts : i was completely dismayed.....while my hair was getting cut...my hair cutter was also cutting a little boys hair....i live in a classy part of san antonio and was recently invited to a ritzy party in downtown now i dont know if i can show my face....before the incident i looked like a respected individual ready for classes in two weeks....now i look like a punk with no hair going to the military....when i was receiving my hair cut i asked for my sides to be thinned not a mohawk..... if this is how you treat an individual much needs to be improved with your company and the faculty that represents you!....."
jezebel is fantastic. she listens to her customers to ensure they get the haircut they want. i've not been disappointed with her service.
i have been here 45 minutes   there are 3 workers but only 1 is cutting hair. terrible customer servicei can't imagine who owns this place and allows the workers not to work. don't waste your time. hi somewhere else
omg. if lisa actually cut hair as much as she talked there wouldn't be long waits. i dont think she knows how to cut hair and have a conversation at the same time. everytime she starts talking the cutting stops. even worse when she turns around to talk to the other employees. not everyone wants or cares about your conversations. who cares who is traveling to cancun this weekend. just cut the dang hair. and while we are at it get that damn mop out of tour face you cant even see with that hair hanging over your right eye. looks like my dog
"the swatch i picked for my hair color was the brightest red and when elisa colored my hair and it looked almost black i asked why it was so dark.  ""oh, i just mixed all the colors.""  whaaaaaaaaaat?  my hair looked better when i walked in than when she was done.  instead of charging $45 like all the other hair stylists did (who had done a good job) she charged me $75 without much of an explanation.  it had taken her about an hour longer than the other hairstylists to do the same job and she reeked of smoke.  never again."
"come in when the place was virtually devoid of customers. there was one gal finishing up a haircut, and another standing around doing nothing. the haircut gets finished, and then both stylists just stand around texting and chatting, while no haircuts get done.i got my haircut completed, and went straight to a meeting, where they suggested i get a haircut. i guess i didn't get enough lopped off of my curly mane. parking is easy here, and there's lots of places nearby to hang out at while waiting for your hair cut. the price was higher than i'm accustomed to paying for a hair cut, but i guess this isn't the drive-thru at rio's golden cuts."
"7 people in the waiting area. 0 people cutting hair, down from 1 who just finished a haircut and is now outside.  app said a 5 minute wait, i've now been here 45 minutes with no indication that haircuts will start again soon, because the only other hairdresser here has been talking to some dude for 30 minutes. it's 11:45 on a friday.  jezebel cut my hair and did a great job- but the overall staffing needs some work."
"does anyone know which salon brittani (sp?) moved to? five stars to her, zero stars to the witch that just jacked up my do."
i i have been getting my hair cut by lisa at this location for the last year and she is wonderful. she will give you advice on what cur to get if you're unsure and suggest different practices or cheap products to use. great service!
"butcher job!  been here 5 times since moving to the area.  i don't believe i've seen the same girl twice.  they must have a hugh turnover.  for the most part the cuts have been acceptable.  i'm really not that particular.  i figure it'll grow back quickly.  however, this last time i got a girl named karina, and and absolute butcher job.  took most everything off the top, and left the back really long.  definitely won't let her near me again."
brittini did an excellent job and truly shows how loving what you do can result in a truly exceptional experience for clientele. this was my first visit here and because of the customer service will not be the last.
laura is a great and always has a good attitude. it took me a year to find someone to give me a good haircut in sa. i am glad i found someone who knows what they are doing.  if you do visit this location and need to get a cut ask for laura cause she does a good job and genuinely cares what your hair looks like after you leave...basically she has what others lack which is common sense.
"i couldn't have been happier. the supercuts on stone oak blvd closed and i loved that place!(shout out to jasmine and stacy!)i've was hesitant about where to go, but finally had to get a haircut since i decided to go someplace close to home for a haircut, and i looked silly.  i decided to get the cut fixed at the next closest supercuts. this place was amazing!!  the salon is very nice; the stylists were so nice and professional!  my haircut was perfect!!   the stylists take the time to listen to what you want, ask questions, and then do exactly what you want.can't say enough good about this place. i'll definitely be back!"
"i am not sure about other supercuts locations, but be aware.... if your visiting this location make an appointment online! i walked in around 4:20pm and there was only one hairstylist cutting a gentleman's hair. first thing i thought was ""awesome! no wait."" then the hairstylist asked for my name, and told me she was booked with appointments until after 5pm.  my no wait, turned into a 40-45min wait, no thank you. so i thanked her and left. i don't blame the hairstylist for being the only hairstylist working, or even the fact she was booked with appointments. i do however think that no business can thrive if they have no supply to demand. they definitely need more hairstylists at this location. unfortunately i'll have to take my business elsewhere."
"okay ! won't lie, i was a bit nervous to cut my longggg hair at super cuts. i always thought of them as a men's barbershop, but i was feeling wild and was open for anything ! upon walking in, i was greeted, told the waiting time and received a smile. i was next in line on brittany's chair, and she was extremely helpful attentive to my new hair look desires. she did a fantastic job ! and to top if off, it only cost $15! i would highly recommend her and will be coming back for my trims !"
"my husband went in for a haircut and came out bleeding with blood all over his shirt. the lady cutting his hair never stopped talking about herself and chopped off all of his hair. when he returned home, he had patches of hair left near his neck and has a huge section of scratches and cuts. he was bleeding and had been scratched up. the prices are also more expensive than the other supercuts just just 2 miles away. i get that if you walk in to a low budget barber shop you may get what you pay for, but does that also mean, blood, sweat and tears."
"this location is fairly new and started off strong.  there were plenty of employees and it was in and out.  on my last three visits there has only been one employee and long waits with people who checked in online coming in before you.  unfortunately im going to have to go back to fantastic sam's.  this the supercuts located in bulverde shopping center in san antonio, texas, at bulverde & 1604."
"i made an appt for 715 on my app and it said there was a 35 minute wait. so i got here around 715-716. i walked in and they said hello and to sign in. then about 5-8 mins later, the one stylist said ""you checked in online?"" and i said ""yes ma'am!"" she said ""okay we'll be right with you."" i sat down and about 20 mins later i am/was still waiting. there was another stylist who finished with a client and took another customer that came in about 15 mins after me. i usually don't come here, but i've been her before and never had any other problems. i'm missing my stylist bc she's on maternity leave......"
i always get my haircut way past the time i should.  i like i can go to supercuts and get it cut the day i feel like i really need it.  recommend that you pick your stylist on line and set that appt. up.  this is a walk-in hair company so you may wait if you walk in.   love patty.  she is always friendly and gets the job done. very affordable.  thanks again.
"i needed a quick trim before flying out to a wedding.  patty did a great job and now my hair looks great!  you can't beat the,$13.99 price either (i didn't need a shampoo or blow dry ... that'll run you only $20.00).  i'll be back in 6 weeks!"
"supercuts is always good if you're looking for a quick trim and an unbeatable price for ladies. really can't complain too much when the haircut ends up coming out to less than $20 overall.the stylists are nice, my only beef was that when i went in to get a trim the stylist didn't know how to trim my bangs. their not crazy, just side swept. i could tell when she got to them that she was really struggling with how to cut it and trim it. they kept coming out choppy and uneven all over. since i've had this hair cut for an extremely long time, i've seen the same technique used through different stylists over the years (and throughout different states). i hate to tell people how to do their jobs, but it's also how they learn. i mentioned to her how others have trimmed the bangs and she still seemed extremely lost. was just a concerning since bangs seem really common these days- this easy request turned into somewhat of a nail bitter for me. they didn't get butchered too bad though, i was able to fix them at home- and like i said you can't really complain with a price like that."
"don't go on tuesdays.  only 2 people working and one helping run front counter.   expect a long, long wait due to them being under staffed.  try another place."
you get what you pay for....usually a hit or a miss it really does depend on who you get....i recommend scheduling ahead of time with the right person.
"the service was fast and professional! they said ""25 min wait"" and they did not lie to us. i got my brother a kid's cut and she did an amazing job. the cut was sharp and only cost $10, but as i was standing in line another patron had a coupon, but was unable to use it so she gave it to me! the hair cut was only $7.95! i tipped $4 bucks and i will go back there the next time my brother needs a haircut!"
"great cut, great price - i have a huge amount of hair and jasmine did a fantastic job, from washing to finishing. she talked me through what she recommended, then cut it just like we agreed. add in a superb scalp massage and i'm sold. my husband and our sons also get their hair cut here and they are really happy with both jasmine and gracie. jasmine was working by herself and she did a really good job on my hair while also greeting new customers and checking them in. i didn't feel rushed at all even though she had a client waiting for their turn. great experience and i'll be back!"
"awful. just awful, i explained the simple cut and even showed her pics. i felt bad for the lady cause i shortly learned she had no clue what she was doing, by the time i stopped her, it was too late and my daughter paid the price right before a birthday party. this place is on my ""never again"" list. sadly my husband has gone there for over a year. do not go to this lady!"
"graciela gave me a great haircut!  she listened intently to what i wanted and though it took her extra time, wow, it is perfect!  thank you graciela!  i'll definitely be back cause on top of that, the price was great!  i am so pleased, yes, so very, very pleased."
my husband goes here and doesn't have trouble. i went in and there was one stylist working on someone's hair. she didn't even acknowledge me when i walked in. there was a family that came in as i did and they were acknowledged. i was sitting there and up came another stylist and took one of the family members before me. i just needed a trim and style. i will not be coming back. i can see what others mean by unprofessional.
this location is dated and the staff are unprofessional.  i've seen the hair stylists take personal calls during haircuts.  super long waits even when there is nobody there...
only one hairdresser on staff and she is not friendly at all. to me it seems like she hates life and hates what she is doing
"literally my hair looks like i tried to cut it myself, with a viking sword, without a mirror, with only my left hand. it is truly unbelievable how bad they messed my hair up."
checking in online with their new app is  a complete waste of time. checked in 45 minutes early so once i arrived i could walk in and be serviced. to my surprise both ladies working that evening took multiple clients after me showing up and checking in. at that time i was told that i would be taken care of they did not inform me i would have to wait an additional 20 minutes and  three customer later i was next. then as i left the premises a large gentlemen came out after i had left assuming to make sure no trouble was to be started.... since when were workers spouses/ boyfriends allowed to start sitting in chairs behind the counter where stylists work and act like a hired body guard to super cuts employees ? i won't be returning to super cuts and the bad thing is i have been a customer since i was a young child.
"the young lady that had done my hair  twice is perfect. i cant remember her name ( it starts with an  r ) but she has been perfect , i am an unconventional woman (( not the usual just a trim person and wear my hair in a flattop ) and she listens and does exactly what i wanted even doing a couple of design lines in the back . could not ask for better !!!"
went with my husband. first stylist said she didn't know how to cut a flat top. we said we'd wait because three other stylists were there. after waiting 25 minutes one stylist took someone who came in after we did (he'd called for an appt so that's fine) but the other two went to lunch without saying a word. just disappeared. so we left. amazingly poor service. won't be back.
they did better than the barber shop on lackland afb but not the best haircut my husband has gotten.
"1st time coming here, i needed 2 haircuts for my children came in without an appt.  and they took them super fast. definitely coming back again, great  and friendly customer service."
"since when does it take two ladies to go talk about high lights costs and different colors. to make it worse both ladies left their stations to talk. errrrrrr. oh well, hair cut ended up ok but i do think they need more stylist."
"i've been here a few times for myself and son. all times we were taken care of right away and our haircuts have always been on-point. the ladies are very sweet and after sitting there for a few hours having color done, i noticed a lot of regulars come through which was very nice to see."
"i came in and was told there were 2 people in front of me.  there were two people waiting, so ok.  i understand that people check in online, but 4 people later i was still sitting there.  i get it, people have their regulars, but at least have the courtesy to acknowledge the customer still waiting as people after them are checking in and seen before them."
"went and got highlights and it took about 2 hours. all the girls there were very professional and my hair came out great. i noticed that the store is very clean, cleaner than i have seen anywhere else. i noticed all the stylist were pretty fast, most of them told me hello while i was ""cooking"" as they called it. so basically it was a fun to group of girls who managed to interact with everyone. later on in the day i took my 4 year old son to get a zero fade and it came out excellent. defiantly a family environment. i will most defiantly be back. tuesday they have $10 haircuts."
"the only person i go to is rosalina. she does a good job, so far my experience is the people are quite friendly."
one person ahead of me. waited over an hour to get service. the ladies on the weekend are super slow. never had bad service here before. however note dont come on sunday.
"i will never go to another super cuts again. the people that worked there were rude to another customer, did not know how to cut hair. i know i was in trouble when i told them to cut my son hair medium fade 0 on the side and a 2 on top. and the lady said do i want to keep the sideburns.  lol did not know how to do a fade and another women had to finish it. my bad experience."
"they did a decent job on my daughters hair, shaped it to frame her face, facility was clean and close to my house for a quick trim it works but i didn't like is that i waited 30 minutes after my appointment time."
"sitting here waiting for 45 minutes, 2 hairstylists cutting hair, and many more keep popping from the back, just look out and go back to their little room in the back. wait is ridiculous, only reason i stopped here, again, is to give them a second chance from previous times months ago, again, same service. slow, and girls here seem to hate their job. for sure not giving them a 3rd chance."
i'm usually skeptical to go to places like this for a haircut because i'm super picky and sometimes i don't want to splurge for a simple haircut/ trim.  my friend recommended me to stop by here and ask for mary and omg every time i go i am  always satisfied!!! i can show mary a picture of what i'm aiming for and she always gives her honest opinion before she cuts my hair and that's what a good stylist should do! please please try it out and ask for mary she's the best you won't regret it!
best hair cut i've had in many years. come by and see mary i promise you won't be disappointed.
the skills of the stylists is average yet no one seems like they actually enjoy working here. it's frustrating to be told you're next on the list and then 5 people get called before you. their explanation was that other people had checked in online or called ahead but shouldn't that have been mentioned when we initially checked in? i'm fine with waiting as long as i have a good idea of how long i'll actually be waiting for.
supercuts does a fine job of cutting my hair. then again i have a very simple hairstyle. if you're looking for inexpensive salon treatment for your coiffure then i would give supercuts a minute. my biggest complaint is that they always leave too many cut hairs on my head and down the back of my neck and shirt. this happens not only at this location but every supercuts i have been to. immediately after getting a haircut i always go to the bathroom and wet my hands and run them through my head to remove all the little hairs. i don't know if this is due to improper training or desire to sell you a shampoo and rinse but this is not acceptable.
i visited this location when i was out of my state for a wedding. the place is nice clean and efficient. they're realistic on wait time and everyone greats you. it was my 1st time going there and i need a updo for a wedding. sarah jane ( i believe that was her name) who actually did my hair was nice and friendly. she kept making sure she wasn't being to rough with my head. i didn't know exactly how i wanted my hair i suggested somethings to her and showed her the dress i was going to wear. she did a fantastic job.
"apparently the solution for a cowlick here is to cut it super short... despite the hair around it being about 2-3 inches long. i am not too picky about my hair. first, because i still have a decent head of hair and that makes me happy. second, it grows back. but when a stylist is as lazy or incompetent as to simply cut the cowlick extra short in hopes that addresses the issue i get a little upset. what makes the matter worse is when i noticed the hair on the back of my head was longer than other parts i asked her ""why is not even with the front?"" and she told me ""because i don't want the cowlick to stand up."" i did not notice the botched job she did until i got home and was extra mad because not only did she cut the cowlick extra short, she used the cowlick as an excuse for keeping the hair uneven on top my head! avoid this place! there are plenty of others within the couple miles."
"haircuts are quick and usually decent, though quality can vary by stylist. my kids get great cuts here. i don't like to have my own done here, though, as nobody seems to be able to cut decent layers. i did get my bangs trimmed today while my son got a haircut, and while i was happy with my bangs, i was pretty disappointed with the experience. my stylist asked if i wanted a haircut too and i declined. she talked me into a half-inch trim, which she completed in under 5 minutes on my completely dry hair--didn't spritz it with water, let alone wash it--then charged me for a full haircut. i thought it was odd she didn't even wet it down, but then thought maybe she was being nice and still considering it a bang trim--nope. won't make that mistake again--or go back to this location."
"for starters, i love this supercuts! i've been coming here for several years and have never left unhappy!! i recently got my hair dyed and my hair definitely took to the the color and it came out way too dark. i was so unhappy with the color. not anyone's fault, just wrong selection of color done by us. ‍ well i came in today and emma was so helpful and patient when trying to fix my color. she worked so diligently to make sure i left happy but also to keep my hair healthy. it was trial and error, but i'm so happy with how my hair turned out! i had to hug her at the end! definitely recommend this supercuts and emma!"
"i'm not one to write reviews, i actually created an account specifically to write how horrible this location is.hands down worst haircut i have had done. the girl had no idea what she was doing. she attempted to tell me she was done, i had to point out the obvious patches of hair she left. i would've asked her to fix it but i was worried she would leave me nothing to fix if she made it worse. i asked for gel and instead of her styling my hair i had to do it myself because let me quote her, ""my fingers are stubby"". if you can't apply gel to someone's hair you probably shouldn't be cutting it to begin with.there was another employee kissing her partner which was very unprofessional.i've gone to supercuts for awhile and this is by far the worst location and experience i've had. if i could give it zero stars i would.avoid if you like your hair!"
"i usually like going here, but the last time i went the lady who cut my hair seemed to be in a huge rush even though there was no one else waiting.just chopped at my hair with scissors with almost no attempt at making look like i didn't just grab scissors and do it myself"
"i checked in online, drove over there only to find they were closed at 5:45 pm on a monday night to film a commercial. perhaps you shouldn't take reservations if you're closed. perhaps you should change your website to reflect your random closings. thanks for wasting my time. if you can't do the simple things right, you can't be trusted with anything."
the best bang for your buck !!!!!great hair style and friendly atmosphere.
"dee is my favorite.the ladies in here are always having a good time and atmosphere here is alway lively i've had 3 - 4 great hair cuts hereask them to go hard on you during the hair rinse,      you'll thank me later."
i have been coming to this location for well over 7 years! lenzy is by far the best! you may walk in as just a client but you leave knowing your part of the supercuts family! all the others ladies are friendly! love this place!!!!!
"wow! i have been coming here for over two years now and this place has always exceeded my expectations. the ladies are friendly, welcoming, and professional. you can tell they love their job. i have been going to lyndsey the longest. she is amazing as well as dee! the prices cannot be beat and the wait time is not long. i've never had any complaints. i highly recommend. i will be back soon!"
they did a sloppy haircut on me and my dad. the people were rude and i do not recommend this place.
the girl with pink hair named kayla cut my brothers hair who is very specific with the way he wants his hair and she was told to just trim the sides of his head and she ended up cutting off his hair on the top of his head and left him with a very sad and ugly hair due which left my brother crying after leaving the salon. supercuts is not the place you want to go to get you're hair cut (the way you want it.) this all explains on why the place was empty and only $15.
"i came in and saw lyndsey yesterday and she did a phenomenal job on my short haircut. i tried cutting my hair myself to be short enough for work and it didn't turn out too hot. but anyway, she was incredibly professional and very kind to me. i would highly recommend and will definitely come back if i'm still staying here in town."
sarah did awesome job! she cut and style my hair perfectly. she listened my wishes and  gave me few suggestions and i end up walking out with big smile. i will def go back.
this is an update. lindsey and angie are still there and continue to do a great job. they also have dee and another young lady there who do great work as well.
"great haircut for a reasonable price.  karen is the bomb, especially if you get a shampoo, and lindsay is good, too, with her spicy personality hahaha..."
great and friendly staff! lenzy is a great stylist! dee is wonderful! you can't go wrong with either stylist!!
"dee was absolutely awesome. i had an appointment at another place a little further down the road. but, they stood me up so i went here instead. i'm really glad that i did. i will be back. thank you!!"
"i had my hair cut today by dee, she was friendly, professional and did a great job on my hair. this was the first time i visited a supercuts and am very please that i did. i will definitely return. thanks dee!"
"very good and friendly! walked in without an appointment but didn't have to wait very long to be serviced. there were two ladies working and both were very nice and welcoming. the parking is ample and the service is great. it didn't take very long for her to clean up my hair and bangs, and she also gave me recommendations for good food places! decent pricing as well. i would come back if i was back in san antonio again. thank you for the great service! keep up the great work!"
"i had a good experience here: all the ladies were nice, and payed close attention to what i had to say. i hadn't gotten a haircut for a while, but each place i went to didn't listen to what i wanted. so in other words i am very protective with my hair and who cuts it. i'm a college student, i needed somewhere cheap but does good quality cuts. i'm very happy i found this place and i will be going back more and more."
lived in sa for 6 months and went here off and on. best supercuts i've ever been too. never got a bad hair cut here and could trust all the girls there. took one star off cause i would prefer to wait an extra two minutes than to walk through and sit in a strangers hair...
"i wanted a cut that was shorter, long enough to pull up off my neck when needed, easy maintenance and still cute after a wash and go. chloe did exactly that!  love it!  i recommend chloe if you need a cut."
"not pleased. i have been here since 430 for 2 haircuts. (its now 540)boy hair cuts no less.  we were given an appt time of 445. i understand taking your time with a client. but there was an hour spent on a kid (about 14)who had been left here and mom gave no direction on what needed to happen. almost done  with his hair and here comes big brother. mom wants it short. so now we have to call mom and get direction that should have been given before hand. to say i am not pleased is an understatement. i only came here bc their regular barber was closed. i am in dire straits. it won't happen again. and this girl had better be as meticulous with my son's hair as she was with the kid before him.well, she didn't. she offered me $5 off. as i was trying not to allow my anger get the best of me,her manager stepped in and comped the haircut.thoroughly disappointed in how the stylist handled or was going to handle the situation. she was a bit confrontational with me and i not been weak with hunger at this point she would have seen a side of me i save for very few."
"i've gotten haircuts here before and they're usually nice, but every time i come in it's an issue!  i don't understand how a haircut place like supercuts offers walk-ins yet you can never get a haircut when you walk in.  they always make you come back an hour later or way later in the afternoon.  remember they don't make appointments, right?! i try to call instead.  i called at 1:10 to try to put my name down for 2:30 and the girl tells me that they can't schedule me that far out because they don't do appointments.  she tried to schedule me for 2:10.  so i call back at 1:30 (note: 15-20 min difference) to try to get 2:30 and another girl tells me that they can't see my at 2:30 and tried to schedule me for 3:00!!!  what?!!  that's an hour and a half later.  mind you...the other person told me they couldn't schedule that far out!!  i don't get why it's so difficult to get a haircut at this place and i'm sorry, but ana has helped me before and she's always been so nice, but today on the phone she really had bad customer service.  sounded as though it bothered that she had to answer the phone and help me.  i'm disappointed with this place.  i've been here at all hours of the day and they're excuse is that it's always a busy hour.  i will now be going elsewhere.maybe they should have a person dedicated to walk-ins only!  don't advertise that you take walk-ins when in reality it never happens!!"
"this supercuts is one of the highest rated in san diego. i was fortunate enough to be in the area and the app wait time stated zero minutes waiting.  i came at the right time apparently, as soon i was getting my hair cut the place got swamped with a 2 hour wait time. seems like alicia is the store rockstar ( and apparently the store manger to boot). there are many reviews calling her out by name as their preferred stylist. i can totally agree with the praise. she was fast and precise and this may have been the best ever supercut that i've ever had. a striking difference from my last visit to the mission valley sc where that was a terrible cut. there was also something else about all of the stylists here. they looked like stylists from a fancy salon, not from supercuts or sports clips. you don't have to worry about having someone that looks like your mom giving you a haircut here...- wednesday, thursday, early, but never come here on a saturday. - ask for alicia...."
"asked for a fade using clippers on the back and sides, but the hair stylist stated she was not comfortable blending with clippers (!), and instead used scissors and spent about 20 minutes doing it by hand. the end result was this weird choppy look that i definitely did not ask for."
"i hate to give this awesome review simply because i don't want my stylist to get too busy and make it difficult for me to schedule with her. however, she deserves a great review. i always get a 1 or 1.5 cut on the sides and back and most stylists don't take the time to run the clippers long enough to make sure every hair is cut evenly. alicia (manager) does take that extra step and makes sure every thing is to my liking. i've been to many barbershops and i can never get the cut i want at an affordable price. alicia is the best!the facilities and clean and the rest of the staff is also nice. it certainly makes it easier to schedule with the supercuts app now that it works properly."
"i came here originally to get a botched haircut fixed (my own doing) and alexis came to the rescue. everyone at this location was and continues to be helpful, accommodating and kind. i now go to alexis for my bang trims, haircuts, blowouts and i now buy my shampoo and conditioner here. this place is the real deal. great service. great prices."
"so bummed out! my daughter came here for a color fix and explained exactly what we were looking for. long story short and 2 1/2 hours later, she walked out with the front of her hair being white with violet in the front that i ended up having to go to the grocery store to buy hair color to put foils in my own to fix her before pictures. i was very clear to her and the other she asked to his sister, that i was unhappy and that she needed to fix it. she even had the guts to charge me $85 for the mess. i was just sick. beware when people sound like they know what they're talking about. if you need a color job .go somewhere else"
"i love this place. i've been going here exclusively since they opened and have had nothing but excellent service and even better haircuts. roxy is my go to stylist and has been for quite some time now. she's always happy and does an amazing job. she's friendly and really cares for her clients. her tea tree treatments are extremely relaxing and totally worth the extra price. i wouldn't think that getting a haircut would be something i'd ever say i look forward to but i love going to the supercuts in poway!if you don't want to wait, make an appointment over the phone or use the app! it's easy and super helpful."
"moved back to the area last year and usually stop by here on a whim once every month or two to get my hair shaved down to a number 1 length mainly for ease of waking up at 0400 everyday and considering i usually wear a hat. stopped by here today and was able to call ahead on my way home which was very convenient, but also had a great experience. alicia was very inventive with my bi-monthly head shaving when it came to fading my beard and shaping the back of my head. who knew you could have both squared and rounded at the same time! **mind...blown...** additionally, i got a legit beard massage which i would never have thought to be a thing until today. the beard oil she used was also on point! glad to have moved close-by to a legit supercuts! will definitely keep this as my regular place!"
"i've been coming to this location for approximately 2 years because anna gives me a fantastic cut every time. lately though, i feel like it might be time to look elsewhere. there is no receptionist at the salon and the stylists have to stop what they are doing to answer the phone, greet customers and check them in. anna even had to stop cutting my hair to assist the at&t tech who was there working on the salon's internet (while i sat in the chair for 10 minutes waiting with a quickly drying head of hair) the result? a crappy, poorly shaped cut. as i said, i've been going there for 2 years and this is not a new situation, there has never been a receptionist and the stylists have always had to stop their work to attend to others, but it's always annoyed me and just felt like it is beyond time to say so. anna is not to blame, she's always professional, apologetic, and does great work so i hope the powers that be actually read these reviews and consider properly staffing their salon. it's not fair to paying customers and it's not fair to the hard-working gals that work there. quit being cheap supercuts!"
very rude staff. i made an appointment and when i showed up they told me two people were still in front of me. i asked why did i make an appointment if i can't be seen at that time. they told me they were running behind. i responded with asking how long it would take to wait and they couldn't give me a direct wait time and laughed at me while i asked questions. i made an appointment so i wouldn't have to wait for 30+ minutes. as someone who is in this industry myself it would behoove your company to not treat your clients this way. if you're running late do your client the decency to call and let them know. i drove all the way out to this salon for nothing. i will not go to a supercuts again if this is how they run their business.
"$19 for basic trim$4 for shampoo45 min-1 hr wait for 1 person @ 3:30pm on a friday???? (only one stylist on the floor). there were two people waiting ahead on me and i watched as 4 people walked in and then left, after they heard that the wait was 45 minutes. one of the most ridiculous parts about the wait is that there was another stylist there, but instead of cutting hair she was putting price stickers on merchandise. huh???!the only 2 reasons why i wound up staying here was bc 1) it was the closest place to my house (the next closest place is wendy's hair and design & they charge an insane $55 for a basic trim...wait, huh??? does it come with anal bleaching or something??). 2) i got very little sleep last night so i didn't feel like driving further."
"been here about 8 times now and never had a bad haircut.  roxy is great but also used a couple of the other girls.  there is a good vibe in there, no awkwardness or insincere conversation."
my first time here. i'm super happy with my haircut. roxy did a great job! make sure to make an appointment since there's always long waiting list.
alicia is amazing!! i'm so happy i stumbled in here and got her!! she took her time and cut my hair to perfection!! i will for sure go back to her every time! i love my hair and i'm sooo happy i met her! thank you alicia!!
"first let me start by saying that i am really happy with my hair cut done by savana, however, the color experience was awful! i have completely white hair as i am prematurely grey. i decided to have it colored platinum so it didn't look so stark. savana colored it. on the first attempt it came out rusty white with a pink hue. the second attempt turned my hair a light aluminum shade. she said that the color wouldnt take because my hair lacked pigment. i just stated that i wanted some warmth added to my already white hair...so .....on the third attempt she put ""gold "" in it and it came out burnt orange. ....then i just gave up!...my co-workers said it looked like a golden lemur or a golden retriever. so to make a long story short don't ever have your hair colored there. i suspect that the stylist there lack experience with color."
"i always get nervous trying to find a new place to get my haircut since having just moved back to san diego. i work close by this supercuts and thought i'd give it a try and alicia did a great job. turns out she's the general manager for this location as well as a few other locations, murphy canyon and i think escondido. naturally she did a great job being the gm, i suppose one would expect nothing less but there are those managers out there... anyway, we had a great conversation while she was working on my hair and she did not thankfully, forget that she was cutting my hair because of the conversation.i also noticed that she did a great job overseeing the shop in general, the other stylists (but not micromanaging) and tending to the customers who walked in.i was impressed because on two occasions she specifically remembered details about other customer's cuts and preferences. one guy who walked in, she passed him on to another stylist because she was busy with me and she told the stylist exactly how the gentleman liked his haircut and believe me, it was not just a generic instruction. props to alicia, i hope to have the same experience each time i go in to your shop, especially when you are not there. you seemed to run your businesses very well and have a great rapport with your stylists and customers, so i imagine it to be the case. then will come the 5th star"
alicia did an amazing job on my haircut. i went from a boring just below the shoulders haircut to a perfectly layered and cute cut above the shoulders. it's couldn't have turned out better. i'll be back for sure!
"roxy! yes that is the only word you need to know. .aka roxanne makes me really look forward to a haircut. i have been seeing roxy for about a year now and every time i can count on a good cut. she is fun and friendly, precise and efficient. i love the way the online appointment works, it's very convenient and alleviates any wait time."
"lil sarah washed, cut, and styled my hair.  i was so impressed with her professionalism and positive attitude.  i enjoy going in to see her and always love the way she does my hair.  she is the best!"
truly enjoyed having my son's hair cut here. new stylist named kimberly works here now and does a great job. i appreciated there is finally a stylist who cuts hair like a professional. i will be coming back and having his hair cut by her. thank you kimberly!
"marie did a good job , i think she is one of the best men's hair stylist i ever tried she is very detailed and will not rush you out."
"i usually go to supercuts for basic upkeep haircuts (trims, thinning out). went to this location for a shampoo, trim, thinning. i was the only customer in the store during my entire visit. my hairdresser was stephanie. after shampooing she combed through my hair and while i do have fairly long thick hair, i've never had as painful/complicated of an experience brushing it as i did here. i figured it was just a bad hair day for me and dealt with it. the haircut seemed to go fine, fairly quickly, and felt nice and light when i was done. looked ok in the mirror, while still wet. after my visit i threw my hair into a bun, headed to class, and didn't really do anything with it until the next day. when i dried and straightened it my boyfriend (who doesn't usually notice haircuts) said , oh my gosh what happened to your hair?   why you ask?!this was due to the fact that not only was there much more visibly gone than the inch i had discussed, but there were chunks of my hair cut at completely different lengths. my bangs (previously swooped to the side) were chopped bluntly but a chunk was missed. the two sides did not match up length wise. there are chunks within my hair (i.e, behind my ear, bottom layer) that should be the longest layer , that are now only about three inches long (my hair goes past my shoulders!!).  when i put my hair in a ponytail now, random pieces won't stay up. i can't wear my hair half up because of the super short areas in the middle layers. and wearing my hair all down and straight poses the same issue.  after working so hard to grow my hair out, i am not sure whether to laugh or cry, at this time i've done  both.  i considered returning to see if a manager could help fix my hair, but i decided i don't want anyone there to touch it again. i could have done a more even cut backwards in my mirror. so disappointed in this experience, not sure how that lady is allowed to touch peoples hair.  :( **in the photos please excuse my un made up face .  i also included 2 before photos-- this was supposed to be a one inch trim"
i got a really awesome hair cut from rose at this supercuts the other day. she understood exactly what i wanted and was able to do it flawlessly. i will definitely go back to her.
"i will continue to go see janet she is very nice and do a good job, love the location as well if i you wanna go out after you're hair is done across the street is the utc mall."
kelly was awesome! she gave me exactly what i was looking for and also advised me on what would look really great on me. i took her advise and i absolutely love my new hair cut!! definitely recommend her!
"i'm super impressed by this supercuts! i came in and was greeted promptly and kindly. kelly, the hair artist, was incredible at listening to what i wanted done, combining the different elements (keep it long, add layers,make it v shaped in the back), and keeping good conversation =)i would def recommend this supercuts! even if your hesitant like i was at first, you won't be sorry ^_^"
"want to get a decent haircut without the salon prices ?head on over to supercuts ! it can be a gamble, but if you like taking risks, this will do !i've been to a few other supercuts locations and surprisingly have been happy with the results. no major traumatic experiences. knock on wood. figured i'd give this place a shot since i was getting my car serviced nearby and needed to kill time. yes..why not get a haircut ? summer is here ! time for a change ! located at a small outdoor shopping center with nearby restaurants/nail salon/small businesses.as i walked in on a friday afternoon, i was immediately greeted. there was one other customer ahead of me, so the wait was short. they gathered my information to input in their system and asked for the type of service i wanted: shampoo, cut, and blow dry - the basicsmy hairstylist, shari asked for what type of cut i wanted. she made sure i was specific with what i wanted which i appreciated. i hate when hairstylists assume and jack up your haircut and don't do anything to fix the problem. anyway, shari was quite the opposite. she was fast, efficient, and very conversational. i felt very comfortable with her. she took 3 inches off and added some layers. it's medium-length which i prefer for my frame. she did exactly what i wanted.in addition, she wanted to know the types of products i used for my hair and to get a history of my haircare routine. she was open to hearing me out and gave me great recommendations.i purchased a couple products that she used on my hair: paul mitchell awapuhi shampoo and conditioner  - love the scent ! no pressure to sell either. overall, i'm very satisfied with the whole experience ! i wouldn't mind coming back if i was in the area.supercuts is really stepping it up and hiring well-qualified hairstylists ! thanks for not burning a hole in my wallet !"
"super frustrated! this weekend i took my son to get his haircut first and last time here! the poor girl was confused about who the next client was even when the other person told her several times my son was next. the name rc seriously confused them. he got a ok haircut she was nice and tired. i was told it was $15, i tipped $2 no problem or so i thought! i check my account and no i was charged $32! i call to ask how much a haircut is the girl says $23 i tell her i was told $15 she says well on tuesday's it's $14. i informed her i was told it was $15. she says oh yes maybe. i tell her i was charged $32 she says that i (me the customer!) made a mistake. i ask what do you mean i made a mistake it was $15 i tipped $2 she says oh yes you must've made a mistake when you tipped. i was pissed now! i told her i'm not stupid! i paid $15 for the haircut i tipped $2 that makes $17 not $32! she insists that it was my error and that i should not be upset. i told her really i shouldn't be upset you guys charged me more than what i approved and i shouldn't be upset?! she tells me to come with my receipt and they'll fix it. i tell her i don't have a receipt she says just come with my card and hung up. fuming i get there telling them i'm there for my refund. she tells me i don't need my card the girl left the money in a envelope then says because i tipped the machine thought i wanted to tip $17 but the girl left my over payment for me. i was too pissed for words but i couldn't just leave i told her very loud to make sure all of them heard in the future you don't tell the customer their wrong and don't have attitude because that's what pissed me off! if you go there you better pay cash if not watch you credit/atm cards they are i'm sure scamming people!"
i came in because my normal barber couldn't take me and needed a haircut today. i asked the lady for a shadow fade and she had no idea what i was talking about. i asked for a light trim than and to clean up around my neck and ears. she couldn't not even give me a straight line in the back. it is even noticeable from a distance how uneven the back of my hair is. i gave up and told her i was done just so i can go home and fix it myself. go somewhere else. you were warned
"called before coming in, an hour before closing, and got turned away when we got there 10 minutes after calling. plenty of people inside the salon but they locked their doors on us when we got there."
"polly is my hairstylist she is damm good at work. she understand what i exactly looking for and gave me a new styling look. thanks to ""polly"" again."
"this review is about chelsea. first of all, i understand the risk of going to a place such as supercuts, however i do not understand how someone so incompetent can work there. i got a haircut there yesterday and asked specifically for a shorter haircut with not too many layers, a very simple and easily completed style-or so i thought. what i walked out with was nothing short of horrifying. the top layer is so short and thick its like a bowl cut around my head. i cannot believe that not only did she not listen to me at all, she also did not well execute the haircut she thought i should have. since i'm out of hair, there is no way to fix it and instead i am using my own money to buy extensions, and heavily relying on a half up do. i would like to see supercuts make some sort of effort to remedy the situation (free product, etc), since now i am basically sol."
my boyfriend joe told me that sarah cut his hair one time months ago and that he liked the way she did it... hope i can get to meet her to see what can she do with my hair because is very thin... maybe i would drop by soon
"i took my son here to trim his hair for school. i specifically told the girl, leave his hair long. and explained in detail how he is very attached to his hair. having only cut it by a barber one other time. i usually cut it.she completely hacked his hair. only leaving the front longer because i asked her to stop cutting. he left in tears because of her inability to understand what the customer asked for.will never return here."
"i love the supercuts at genesee. everyone is extremely accommodating and talented. i'm always greeted with a smile and my overall experience is great. i would like to give a shout out to kelly, who is my go to hair stylist. she is a magician. she knows exactly how i want my hair to be done and always delivers the perfect haircut. thank you kelly for everything you do. i really appreciate it! because of kelly, i keep coming to supercuts at genesee again and again, and will continue to do so!!"
"i spent a few days looking at reviews in the clairemont mesa/kearny mesa for a hair salon that did good work, but was also affordable as i only get my hair trimmed and did not wish to pay $50+ to have my split ends cut and a few layers added. i came across sarah from supercuts on yelp and saw she had really great reviews and took a chance and called up supercuts and asked for sarah. i called an hour before to see when they could take me in and was told to come on over. i was greeted, remembered from my call, and immediately taken to a chair. all i knew was that i wanted long, face-framing layers and to take 2-3"" of dead ends. as i was sitting in the chair, sarah took my vague requests and channeled them into specific, direct actions and really explained to me how certain layers would look in comparison to what i desired and divulged knowledge and expertise to help me achieve the results i wanted. she even offered a certain type of layer that i had never heard of and i could just tell she was trying to help me get the trim and layering i desired. sarah executed trimming my hair and adding layers exactly how i requested. i trusted sarah according to her reviews and her performance did not disappoint. i will continue to see sarah because i know she will use her knowledge and expertise to help me achieve my goals of healthy hair."
"i love coming here! i have an autistic son named mason. his stylist kelly is so great. she talks with him, and  is very patient and sweet! 5 stars all the way! thank you kelly"
poor costumer service. when i walked in there was only one costumer and two employees. for some reason both of the employees were attending the same person. i waited for 5 minutes until one of the two ladies decided to attend me.
last week i took my daughter in for a haircut and it had definitely been a long time (my daughter wanted to try the long hair thing). she's ten and was very sure of what she wanted! kathleen was who did her cut and not only was she nice and friendly she made my daughter feel so happy! even a week later she's still talking about her haircut experience and beautiful new do! we will definitely return and hope to see kathleen again!
"went to get a haircut and she did not know how to give a fade... i asked for a high fade and she kept asking ""are you sure that's what you want?""  i kept saying yes..  she did not blend the sides, so it looks like i have fluffed feathers now. you're supposed to blend the sides so it looks natural.. didnt even bother, she just rushed me.  i went there cause i didnt want to drive 20 minutes to my regular barber ""who is 12 dollars cheaper"" and cuts hair much better without questioning me.  not to mention pointing at my hair and laughing with another barber.  i will never go to a supercuts again.  do these barbers have any knowledge on cutting hair?  i didnt think a fade would be that difficult ."
"we tried to give opportunities to solve my 3 yr old son's first haircut debacle but it was just a mess. bad haircut, no communication or fun for him.   he's such a sweet little guy and the girl took no opportunities to engage, at all.   i would avoid for kids if you expect any personality combined with quality hair cutting.  on a relaxing sunday midday, minimal customers, we specifically asked for someone with experience and good at first hair cuts.  we got the ""oh well all do that"" and it seemed like it was probably just a coin flip and whoever lost got the job. the girl maybe said 5 words to our son.  our son was super chill and did exactly what he was told.  but she never asked his name or anything at all about him, it was just ""look down"".... and "" is that good.?"" and it wasn't.  then the clippers came out and buzz fast and uneven...  very disappointing.  we called back and got apology from manager, took him back when manager was there and she fixed the haircut but didn't really care to satisfy the unhappiness that we wasted our first experience with his hair on them.  they didn't offer to refund us or offer a free next hair cut as we have ""two boys under 8""... a lot of future hair to cut.  you'd think future business would be something they would value but they seemed happy with fixing the mess and having me sign away liability by abmitting my minimal satisfaction.   had the girl been hospitable and done a bad job, or had an amazing haircut and been boring.... maybe it would he something to let go, but both awful and the manager cured the haircut but it was clear our business was not cared for.  unfortunate but there seems to be some good spots for kids, so we will seek some referrals instead."
fantastic servicei stopped in for a hair cut last week and got brianna bishop and she was fantastic!!!! friendly and bubbly personality she made the time go by fast and made me smile
i love this place so much and my favorite hairstylist to go to is estella she's the best. she always does wonders to my hair. as long as she's still there i will always come back. she's a sweet girl. thanks estella
"i've been to so many supercuts, and found the best hairstylist for me....cecily! she understood exactly what i wanted, and it looks great....therefore i'm happy!! i've bought so many hair products as well. she recommended d:struct and i'm lovin that. cecily is also super nice too! thanks!"
worst haircut ever!! do not see stella... she has absolutely no clue on how to cut hair.. and when hearing how upset i was - the rest of the staff gave a looks as though that was the norm... not surprised at my frustration...asked for the closest barber and they gladly gave me it.. manager griselda just stood there like nothing going on... worst place ever
i got my hair colored and cut from manager griselda! she is soooo wonderful! she had me looking fabulous! she always does a great job that's why i go back to her every time! and she's so nice and makes it a really enjoyable experience! i got so many people i work with saying ur hair looks fabulous and makes u look younger! how great is that!
super cuts is the best place to get your hair cut. the hair stylist are friendly and do a great job on cutting your hair the way you want it. i've been back three times and have been satisfied each time. i recommend supercuts to anyone who needs a haircut.
got a haircut.  it's bad.  looked fine day of but it's growing in horribly.  bad place for haircuts based on my haircut.
"i made an appointment and i had a $3.00 off coupon , they wouldn't take it because it was for a different super cuts. i chose not to stay and went to the super cuts on el cajon. they were very willing to accept a coupon from a different store.it's amazing to think that a place of business would be willing to lose a customer over $3.00.bad customer service. i won't be going back."
"i came in an hour before they closed for a haircut. wait time was average, but they have seats and recent magazines, so all is well there.i do have to give a shout-out to the hairdressers, though. more than one person came in at the last minute asking for a haircut. when told that no more appointments were being accepted (as i wasn't the only one waiting, it was obvious there was a wait), these people became visibly frustrated; one man was verbally frustrated and said the manager had told him he could come in right until closing. when they said it wasn't policy, he slammed out of there saying loudly and angrily: ""i'll never come back.""at no time was anyone in the business mean or insulting, merely apologetic. not even after the guy slammed out. props to them."
"if you go in for a cut, ask for cecily! she's the best stylist we've had here. my brother and husband both go to her. she's sweet, comforting and detail oriented. all good things when looking for a stylist :)"
i really enjoyed my visit to supercuts. griselda really took her time and did a wonderful job. my hair grows in all kinds of crazy directions and can be difficult to cut but she did wonderfully. thanks again.
"being new to san diego and having no barber, i thought i'd keep it conservative and go with my safe, reliable choice, supercuts. i was very pleased. cecily was wonderful. terrific job on my hair and beard plus a good conversationalist. i'm only here for a few more months, but, for as long as i'm here, getting a great haircut is one thing i don't have to think about."
"the people here are often nice, but the girl who cut my hair was just getting lazy with it. i asked for long side bangs and told her exactly what i wanted and she proceeded to quickly part my hair the way i told her not to in the weirdest way, grab a chunk of my hair, and slide her scissors through it literally as scissors would slide when cutting wrapping paper in a matter of 5 seconds. i'm a very timid and non confrontational person so i just didn't say anything because what's done was done, but they are way shorter than i asked and after leaving, parting my hair the right way, and looking in the mirror i realized that they look so terrible. it's been about a month and a half and they haven't grown back at all and they're way too short to do anything with. the girl with the dark pixie/bob cut was the one who cut it and i'm just so over trying to style my impossible hair. it also only took about 1 minute and a half for the whole haircut (minus the shampooing) and i had to pay $25. after, i went up to the counter and she tried to sell me expensive tea tree shampoo and told me that was what she washed my hair with when i clearly saw her wash it with the paul mitchell shampoo. i'm sad because i have gone here a few times and never had any issues with the other ladies."
fantastic haircut and service from mercedes! she took the time to get it right.
"watch out for shady business.  griselda sold my 93 year old father, who has dementia, a 2 oz product that he can't use for $21 and then took a $25 tip.  so his $21 hair cut cost him $67.  i called to complain and she was very rude and dismissive.  she had no remorse for taking advantage of him.  shameful!!!"
"i really have to give a shout out to griselda for her eyebrow waxes. i have some strong caterpillar eyebrows that i like to have a very specific shape, and she has been 100% on the mark every time i've gone to her. with hair cuts, i went to this location and got a sub par cut from another stylist and when i went back, specifically to griselda, she identified it and fixed the cut, and did a great job doing it. people don't often associate supercuts with waxing (i frequently get asked ""supercuts does waxing!?"") but i am so incredibly satisfied with griselda's work, and with her knowledge of current styles and her skill with my hair."
"i came with my girlfriend here today and she came to get a haircut and signed herself in, nothing out the ordinary, this was our second time and our first time being a very pleasant visit . as we sit in the store, this lady comes in and request to get a haircut and the hairstylist told her a 20 to 30 min and the lady literally said she didn't have time cause she has work. i really thought the stylist would tell her sorry or something like that but literally they put her next. what is that ? we were waiting patiently. so i guess now you can just barge in and say you can't wait that long and you'll be next. you guys should really put this people to the side and make them wait how we did. this experience was underwhelming. it's honestly those people's fault for running late. they should plan accordingly on the things they do rather then barging in like that and not taking inconsideration on the people that sign in and wait."
"all of the staff members at this super cuts location are super friendly. because the wait can be a while, i recommend checking in online especially if you decide to take advantage of the super tuesday $16 haircuts (regular $21) since is gets busier that day. i highly recommend requesting briana. she does an excellent job and has a very warm personality."
this place has been my go to place for haircut. usually chill folks in there with price expected results.  they have a new front desk gal with fiery red hair and exotic appearance who needs to learn how to smile!! talk about a rbf!
"this happened a while ago but i just started reviewing. i went in as a walk-in to get a haircut. they took my name down and i waited in the seated area. other people came in and i noticed they went before me. i thought maybe they had an appointment and i was a walk-in so that was understandable. then i noticed everyone was going before me. i waited about an hour when originally it was stated it would be fifteen minutes. finally, someone came up to me and asked if i had  given my name when i walked in. i said yes and they looked and it wasn't in there. she told me that they lost my name somehow in the system. then even though she just notified me that they lost my name, she took a newer customer and said i'd be next. why would you not just do me next?? what horrible customer service! but she said i'd get a 15% discount. another woman, possibly the manager, came up to me and said i'd get it for free. never went back after."
"sarah is fantastic! i promise that you definitely will be supper happy with your haircut. she also has such a great personality and she won't let you mess you hair up even if you insist lol. trust me, i am talking from experience. lol ... on a serious note, if you are going there for the first time and you are not sure who to ask for, ask for sarah and you will be in safe hands."
i've been coming to this place ever since! the stylists are really great and attentive to your needs.
"i see michelle! i can count with one hand the people i trust to cut my hair. i wish i could say how long she's been cutting my hair, more than a decade ago since she was in the north park location.i like the no fuss approach to haircuts. i don't want to stay for hours with a wash, cut and then blow dry. (don't get me wrong she will blow dry your hair if you want her to) i personally, just don't have time for that. michelle is super skilled, accurate and always professional and polite. thank you!"
i've gone to michelle 3x for a cut and color and she is amazing! best hair cut i've had in sd and love my color. i will definitely go back.
"i received a fantastic haircut from marcia at the hillcrest location. she was incredibly detailed and the results were amazing. she was also very nice to talk too. i feel great, thanks marica."
"so i found my new stylist.  nicole takes her time and gives great suggestions for my hair style.  i had a color and a cut and love them both.  i have had issues in the past with stylist pulling on my hair which was painful since i do have a sensitive scalp.  nicole is gentle almost to the point where i am so relaxed i could fall asleep. she also gave me the best scalp massage when she was shampooing my hair.  if you want a ""spa like"" experience ask for nicole."
"this store has absolutely horrible customer service, i will never go there again. i got to the store and they had 2 stylists working and 1 person waiting, so i waited. when the stylist were done they took the person who was waiting before me. his cut was quick, maybe 10 minutes. both stylists were done and went in the back and 2 other stylists had also come in. i sat waiting patiently, but they all went in the back like i wasn't there. and one stylist was setting up his station and i asked what was going on, he said he'd ask them in the back...i left, what a waste of time."
"i went to nicole for a haircut and coloring for my wedding.  she did a phenomenal job of cutting my hair.  she was very detailed and took her time.  she made sure to check in with me to make sure i liked it and even went back in a couple times for small changes.  the coloring turned out great too.  some bleeding, but i don't think that is her fault."
"it didn't suck and i was pleasantly surprised.  came here with my friend bobby that wanted to get a quick haircut, he was thinking about getting it buzzed but changed his mind at the last minute.   i said well damn, i need a trim let me try them out it's just hair anyway and what's an inch off anyway. i got jaime, she wasn't very friendly at first but she warmed up to me after awhile and it was okay.   sprung for the shampoo as well so with a cut at shampoo it was $22 & a $4 tip and she was pretty fast and from what i saw did a good job for a quick trim.   my mom is a hairdresser so i know what to look for and know all the tactics.  i told her my mom is a hairdresser so no need to up sale me anything since i get them for free in my care packages from her. protip:  looks like the hair stylist to request is jack martinez"
"sad:( you know the feeling , when you walk into a business and feel that the people working there would've preferred you hadn't? that's the feeling at this supercuts! no smiles, no kind ""welcome"" or ""hello"", just an awkward feeling of not being wanted! they took my name but no communication on how long it might be. there was one person waiting so i figured it probably wouldn't take too long. then 40 minutes later, person after person walked through the door and went in front of me! at this point i kinda thought they would let me know how long i had left! nope, not a word! so now i sit, already invested 45 minutes, do i stay or do i go and start over at a new place? super, not!!!!!!!"
i am the kind of person that does not go to the same stylist or make appointments. i am in a hurry and when i want a haircut i get one right then. that all changed when i started going to lokki. he does such an amazing job on my hair and also eyebrows. this is the second salon i have been to see him and i will  keep following him. he knows exactly how to cut and style my hair to make me look and feel great. besides being an amazing stylist he is so much fun to talk to! he gets five stars!
"ok, called general manager and she said they had a new manager since we were at supercuts mission hills and she said they she cut hair good and we wold like her. went back and was totally pleased. i guess at some point they ""cleaned house"" and the last person we had  problems with was no longer there along with others.the change of management could not of been better..so once again we are fans. yea!"
"never again......i went in with hair below my shoulders and i came out looking like buster brown.  i have thick wavy hair and the idiot who cut my hair did not know the difference between feathering hair and layering hair.  this person didn't even know how to cut feathered bangs.  i had to go the next day and find a salon that could cut my hair so that i didn't look like buster brown.  went down to avalon and the wonderful lady there cut my hair in 20 minutes and i love it.  supercuts is a joke, if you want your hair butchered, by all means go in there and let them do it.  all they are interested in is selling you hair products and getting their money.perhaps you should vest your employees and see if they really know how to cut all types of hair.  stay away otherwise you will be very disappointed!!!!!!!!!"
been coming for years. was sad to hear michelle richardson left to another salon but a mutual friend forwarded her facebook page so i could find her. search under her name and it comes right up.
unprofessional. i'm new to the area. disappointed. the behavior of the stylist made me feel like i'd not be returning to this particular location. oh well. live and learn.
"i don't get my hair cut that often, but love that i've discovered this great place, and especially jack! i generally keep my hair long, so he was only seeing me once a year at best and always treated me like a regular!  recently, my hair had grown so long that i decided to chop it off and donate it to beautiful locks, who make free wigs for women and girls dealing with cancer. jack was the only person i'd trust to do this! then, he created such a cute layered bob cut for me that i keep getting compliments on, that i may keep it short all summer! you'll be seeing me again soon jack!"
"the owner of this supercuts location reached out and apologized for the stylist's comments. she also offered to refund the cost of the services and set up a complimentary haircut with her location's manager. very nice and thoughtful.sadly, i felt no choice but to decline. if the services were great but the customer service was terrible - i might have considered but they weren't. yes, my haircut was good but my eyebrows were awful and the stylist was heinously rude. no going back from there.  +1 more star for the owner, still -3 for the stylist's behavior."
i've received a haircut from a few people at this location. it's a hit or miss-- but i continue to come back because it's affordable and the wait is normally not as long as other places. the overall feel of the place is clean and welcoming. the reason why i am giving them a 4 star is because of my experiences with some of their hair stylist. again-- it's a hit or miss.
"have come here a few times for a haircut. one woman does a great job, wish i knew her name but she did a great job.the two other times i've gone here, i've spent a half hour sitting in the chair while the hairdresser tries to upsell me on products.  i ended up buying one that didn't end up working well and was available for half the price online.  my advice, stop constantly upselling your customers and just give them a solid cut."
"such a great experience! they were fast, knowledgeable, and affordable. took two appointments last minute. very happy with my stylists as well."
"10 times i've made an online appointment only to be told when i arrive that the ""system"" messed up and i need to wait or reschedule. never an apology, always made to feel like it was my mistake. stupid me for continually going back for a so-so haircut, but never again."
i have had nothing but good experiences here! i highly recommend victoria and yesterday i was cut by a lady with glasses and pink hair and she was super friendly and was able to get me in & out very quickly. thank you so much!
"this was a good haircut, but i just had a regular 15 min men's hairs cut and it cost 24 dollars!! so overpriced, should've just gone to a barber shop"
"been here once most likely not coming back. the haircut was ok, the stylist was nice but it seems like the manager is always in the back so the girl who was doing my hair was also answering the phones and registering customers at the same time.she left me there at least 3 times!plus the shampoo is not included so you need to pay $5 dls extra and if you say no they tell you"" well i can't really do the haircut without a shampoo, so you don't have the choice. they need to have a receptionist so stylists can focus on their job and shampoos should be included."
"they told me it was a 45 minute wait, ok no problem. i wait over 45 minutes, it happens. i am ok with that. but my turn is up, i know because the gentleman gave the order to us, i have been waiting patiently in the store and they skip me. the employees look at each other as if they don't know what to do. they continue to sit the 2 guests that were just called in place of me. it has been an hour now and still waiting. not happy. been here once before and the haircut was good so i came back. cherry picking clients i guess, i don't know. guess i'm just not coming back.my haircut is now done. nice haircut, they gave me a complimentary shampoo, the other employee that was not one of the original 2 cut my hair and apologized and said there was a mix up after one came back from lunch."
great staff. everyone is super friendly. i've been going to ruben since i first moved down here almost 3 years ago. he always gets the job done perfectly. highly recommend!
this location is amazing. i appreciate the the customer service and the stylists abilities. they are always willing to go the extra mile to make their customers happy.thank you also for displaying the rainbow flag! that means so much.
worst haircut. hadn't been to a supercuts in years. good customer service but haircut sucked. i'll pay extra to go somewhere else. $4 to wash your hair when you butchered most of it off. how she cut the top was so amateur... it literally looks butchered. can't wait for my hair to grow back so i get someone who can actually cut hair. i think i could have done better. she seems nice so i didn't say it to her face how horrible she did. but people should know how horrible she cut my hair.
"today this particular location lost my confidence.  needing to secure cuts for both myself and my four-year-old son i loaded us up to arrive shortly after opening.  we arrived about 9:20 am on a thursday.  we parked on the street at a city meter and before unloading him i paid the maximum on the meter, simply to be safe.  he was not thrilled about getting a haircut, but i had worked on this plan all morning, making sure he understood we needed haircuts in preparation for leaving town in the next couple of days.  we walked in and saw one customer in a chair and two or three others in the waiting area.  as i approached the counter the one stylist, while cutting her client's hair, asked me if the cut was for me or for us both.  i acknowledged that we both needed cuts.  she then informed me that the wait would be more than an hour and that she was the only person there.  what the heck?!?  i can understand the occasional odd schedule with only a few stylists, but only one?  so i wasted my time, my parking money and the only opportunity to get my son and i in for cuts before leaving town.  i would appreciate any feedback from this store's ownership and/or management.  is this your current and ongoing business model?  if so, perhaps you need to simply shutter your business.  at least then i would know from the street not to bother parking.edit: in spite of my rant, i received a swift reply from ryan, indicating their 9-10 am policy.  i appreciated their attention to my concerns."
i have been getting my haircut from ruben s at this supercuts for about 3 years. he's the best and the reason i still go here! always use the app to book your haircuts and you will always know how long to wait or when to come in.
called ahead and put my name in they told me they would be ready for me in 45 minutes which worked perfectly with my schedule but when i showed up i still waited another 45minutes didn't even end up getting my hair cut because i had to be somewhere
"all i wanted was a simple mens haircut. don't bother scheduling an appointment you will wait any way. customer service was bad and in my experience.  i walked in and wasn't greeted but treated like i was an inconvenience. 1 employee was giving a haircut while 2 others were talking in the back while several people were waiting. i didn't even stick around for a haircut i left and went to fantastic sams on university, second time this place let me down. wouldn't recommend it."
"very nice employees but the wait time was rediculous. had my haircut short, for the first time in a long time & the ends weren't thinned out and blended. so went in for a redo and waited an hour after my scheduled time. unfortunately, wouldn't come back or recommend a cut from them."
i was looking for a place close to new apt for regular haircut . i stopped in here on a friday at 230.  i was treated very rudely by young hispanic female before being told it would be 45 to hr wait. both stylists were well into current haircuts and only one guy waiting. i think she just didn't feel like providing me service even though  i had done nothing to earn her nasty attitude. or she didn't feel like working. i've always received excellent service from great clips and sport clips and always tip well. i guess their competitors keep my business .
i get my haircut by ruben and every single time he does a fantastic job. it's worth it to request him to cut your hair even if you have to wait a few extra minutes.
"ruben is absolutely the best hairstylist i've ever had, and i've gone to the fanciest places in san diego in the past. he listens to what you want and is very precise! when i first started going here i was nervous that they might cut off too much hair or butcher it- (but i was on a budget at the time). and oh man, after having ruben he's the only person who has cut my hair after that for over a year. sadly my family and i are moving to sacramento now and i wanted to leave a review and say i'm so upset to not have him cutting my hair anymore!!! my hair is the healthiest and longest it's ever been thanks to him! thank you ruben!"
ruben brings back my best look every time. always worth going back to him. i've been going to him for years.
"upd; the hair was donated!we came to cut and if possible donate my 13 years old daughter's non colored hair. the hairdresser measured confirmed 8 inches and cut to the floor instead of pony tale. then swept it and told - oh , you need 11 inches to donate... i am sorry. she charged us 24 dollars. my daughter cried. and we left. i was extremely sad and disappointed. i will take it further for sure. this unacceptable. poor service. upd - the store manager chrissy was wonderful, she told the store will donate the lock of hair on julia's name. i hope she will. thank you very much."
"cristy is great! knew exactly which haircut was best for my hair type/head shape. great conversation, great cut, will definitely come again"
cristy is awesome!  really patient with everything i asked of her.  she was 2017 stylist of the year!  ask for her when you go in. she's also very experienced with hair coloring :).
"i usually stop by a supercuts every 2 months for a quick trim.this is the location nearest me, but also the one i prefer. staff appear more well organized than other supercuts locations. wait times can be quite long so call ahead for  evenings!"
"great haircuts, an super friendly staff. very nice place. it also has a great location, next to a pizza, taco, and smoothie place. five stars!"
"one hairstylist (who may be the manager...i'm not sure) is very unprofessional. in the middle of cutting my hair, she checks on an intern/apprentice to see how she is doing. additionally, she is constantly trying to sell me shampoos and conditioners when cutting my hair. i never came back here again because of this experience. someone should teach this lady that customers come first."
"just got the worst haircut of my life. asked for a simple military style medium fade with a hard part. there is no fade whatsoever, just a squiggly line going across the back of my head and the hard part is not even close to being straight. she left cut hair all over the back of my neck. didn't offer to add any product or to style it. oh, and she had some rank bo. insanely terrible experience. avoid the older woman stylist here. she has no clue on how to do a simple men's haircut. biggest waste of $26 ever. now i have to go and get another hair stylist to fix the cob job somewhere else."
"i always have a good experience coming here! my hair has never felt, looked, or laid better! all of the staff there are super friendly and just really great people. i would recommend this place to anyone who asks. seriously these guys know what they're doing and do a really great job at it!"
ask for andy. he's personable and did an excellent job cutting my hair. these haircut chains can be hit or miss and the stylists usually stay for a bit then move oni recommend andy
"flew into san diego to visit my daughter.  did not have time deal with my hair before trip.  wanted to look presentable so it was right out of the airport and into supercuts.  thanks to stylist krista for a nice haircut and a pleasant experience.  she is friendly and personable, listens well and offers good suggestions.  in a short time, i walked out with exactly the cut i wanted (and trimmed eyebrows too)."
"first off, i just want to say that my stylist was very friendly and i enjoyed her company while getting my haircut. that is the only reason why i am giving an extra star.other than that, i was extremely unimpressed with the quality of the cut itself. not only did this place increase the prices from my previous visit, this was by far the worst haircut i've ever gotten. the stylist's clippers were so bad that after her first run you could still see long hairs that were not uniform to the rest of them! she had to basically go and cut it all over again. in addition, the front of my hair was completely uneven, one side being non existent and the other being almost the same length as before i came in. around my ears were not even trimmed and i didn't even notice that because there were so many other bad things that were occupying my attention! this also took 40+ minutes while it normally takes no more than 20 and caused me to be late to pick someone up. i do not have a particularly hard head to cut and have never had such a bad result from a $22 male haircut.between this ridiculous price increase and lower quality standard there's no way i'll be back. also worth mentioning is that i normally do not post bad reviews, but this is something that really was unacceptable and based off of the other recent reviews i am not the only one who feels this way."
"great quick local haircut store and convenient location in utc area! i also get my cuts from amber, janet and cathy.. 3 great stylist ask for one of them that's on! a good little place that will check to make sure you're happy and if not they'll make it right.. the manager maggie is also very nice! been going here for 7 years!"
the stylist smelled so bad. like homeless. it was unbearable! never ever again will i visit this place. i can still smell it. unacceptable for a stylist or any other service job employee.
"i recently moved from la and i was nervous to get a haircut. danielle was awesome! she was very attentive and very funny! she was awesome! i told her how i want my haircut and she got it to every detail. my hair looks awesome because of her! she washed my hair, did my eyerbows, and lined up my sides. for $19 it was pretty awesome."
"this review is long overdue! all the stylists i've encountered at the supercut la jolla village square location are great. but i want to take the time to say thank you to jenny! i went to jenny after getting a really bad, uneven haircut elsewhere and jenny was sweet enough to fix my bad hair disaster. she even went as far as showing me new hair techniques and ways to style it. thank you jenny!"
"i've been getting my hair cut at this location for about a year and a half almost. i've gone through multiple hair stylists who came and went and overall it was a great experience. most notably right now, though, is maggie. she does my haircut the way i want it every time and she understands my long term goal of how i want my hair to grow out in a certain way. she makes great recommendations for the type of hair that i have in terms of my daily routine and the products i use. and, she does my eyebrows perfectly. better than anybody else who's ever touched them. i recommend this location for its friendly atmosphere and great hair stylists. i go once a month and every time i leave i am even more satisfied than the time before."
"$19 for a men's haircut. a little on the pricey side for me. i usually go to happy barber where it's about $10 but i got off work late and they already closed. there weren't that many people in line, however the wait still took long. nothing impressive about my haircut. lady was nice but i wouldn't come again unless i really needed a haircut and had no where to go."
"overall great cuts and good experience, but wait times could be long and staff seems stressed at times. prices are also higher than where i used to go for a cut in la, but i don't have any urges to seek elsewhere. parking is easy and the barbers are good at executing what i'm looking for and that also seems to be the case for the other people that have simultaneously had their hair cut when i have gone."
good experience with jenny. she asked all of the right questions so i could get the exact haircut i wanted. very happy.
ashley is an artist! she's been cutting my husband's hair for 3 years (?) now. she's only cut my hair twice. i went to a more expensive salon to get a fancy style but it was a little messy looking and i had ashley fix it up and now it looks perfect!i think i'll let her cut my hair from now on ;)
"i have to say the hair stylists here are top notch. every time i come, the hair stylist always caters to what i want and also provides input on how to make the haircut better. they also give input on where your cow licks are and how to style your hair if you don't know how to. furthermore, they give tips on hair products. they are very invested in you. tips:-every tuesday there are haircuts for 16 instead of 21 dollars. - if you put in your number with them, after every 8th haircut, you get the next for free. what a steal!"
"just got home from an less than pleasant experience at supercuts at costa verde shopping center. i repeatedly said that the clipper was hurting me and that something must be wrong with it but was told that it was just new and sharp.once i got home, my fiancée was shocked on how bad my neck looked as it looked like i had some kind of allergic outbreak, and it keeps on getting worse.not only does it look like i have a skin condition, but it still hurts pretty bad. i can't believe that my stylist did not mention to me that she actually had damaged my skin and played it off like it was all fine.as you can see on the attached pictures, it is not fine. this is not acceptable as i kept on saying that the clipper was really causing me pain during the session."
the worst barbershop i've ever met. their barber isn't professional at all and cut my ear while talking and laughing with others. my ear kept bleeding and no wonder they also gave me a super ugly haircut ever in my life.
"been coming to janet for the past 5 years! she is a gem. sad that i will be moving to oregon because she is irreplaceable. i always walk out with the biggest smile on my face. i get my color here and all my friends always tell me that they ""need that color too""!"
"had a wonderful experience with kayle today very professional, quick, totally understood what i wanted the first time. i walked in at a very busy time and she seemed in control of the whole shop. told me that wait will be 10-15 minutes, it was actually like 7 minutes. so glad i made the decision to just stop in today. i will be back !!!"
"tbh i don't expect to become gorgeous from here. i'm in for the affordable cut and no waiting for people who show up to their appointments late. i call, if there's a less than 30 min wait, i'm there. if not, then i go another time. $15 tuesdays and usually coupons are available online.i feel like the cuts i get on tuesdays are more rushed and careless, they don't always dry your hair or brush it when done. went on a sunday with a $5 coupon = $20 cut and was pretty satisfied."
"simply put i had a wonderful experience at this supercuts, corinne did a wonderful job with what i know is a difficult head of hair. i know its been the headache of hair stylists since i was a kid and she handled it masterfully. i know the online check in function sometimes messes up so i swung by after work and saw a pretty open salon(2 people waiting), had an extremely reasonable wait and then had a wonderful haircut. i'm not great with describing wonderful service but i know corinne gave it through a quality haircut and pleasant side chatter. she gave me some tips on my hair and i left with a clean haircut which for me is the ideal haircut experience. will be visiting again."
we got hoodwinked into a $50 haircut. i wouldn't go to supercuts if i was going to pay that. not worth it at all.
"i've had a few decent haircuts at this location, nothing exceptional but basically what you would expect at a supercuts. however, the previous two times that i either called in or booked an appointment online, the actual wait when i showed up was significantly longer, which is frustrating when going on a lunch break with a limited amount of time. specifically, today, a mother came in to get her daughter a haircut. i was next in line which would have corresponded with my expected time from booking online. however, the mother spontaneously decided that she wanted her son to get a haircut as well, and he was somehow immediately placed in front of me in line and i was told the wait would be an additional 15-20 minutes.this seems quite unprofessional and disrespectful of clients' time as i essentially wasted 10 mins each way driving to the location, as i didn't have the time to wait another 20 minutes. plus who knows whether the mother would have decided to get herself a haircut as well and been served before me. i will not be returning here in the future."
janet is a magician. i have never liked my haircuts but she literally makes me feel sexier. love this place. will never go anywhere else except to see janet. thank you so much.
kathy and janet are fantastic!! i'm extremely picky about my layers and in the 5 years i've been coming here i've never been even slightly disappointed! the stylists are all super friendly and well-trained. there can be a longer wait on nights/weekends but i always call ahead to check and put my name on the list so i don't have to sit and wait so long. i've tried other supercuts locations but this is by far my favorite!
"by far the worst supercuts experience i've ever had. i should have just returned at a later date when the lady in the first chair to the right was working. arrived at 615, i was told 20 minute wait and 2 people ahead of me. cool, no problem with me. well fast forward a hour and a half, an employee getting their hair dyed and washed, and about 8 people getting their hair cut before me, i get pissed. i asked the lady who informed me of my original quoted wait time and she tells me that the list just goes in order and that i'm next. i'm no rocket scientist but pretty sure i should have been next 6 people ago. super bummer cause the lady in that first chair cut my hair perfect every time. beware of ""super tuesday""."
"to be honest i wasn't expecting much, i mean i figured they wouldn't screw up my head so as long as they didn't do that i would have been satisfied. you see my favorite barber is no longer in the area so i had to go to someone new and i was not looking forward to it. but i was very pleasantly surprised, i did the online check in and showed up 20 minutes later and walked right in and sat down in the chair. ashley was my haircutter, and she really did a good job, i was surprised because it was a very good haircut and i had low expectations going in. also it took maybe all of 10 minutes which was amazing, quick and good, hard to beat that!"
"if you are the owner, please contact me.  i want a refund.  bad experience here.  i was charged for a service without being told beforehand that there would be a charge."
great haircut and really friendly staff. you get what you pay for and they have clean cuts here. the best i've seen from any super cuts.
corrinne is great!  i'm a hairstylist and new to the area and in need of a trim.  she took me right away and hooked me up with a great trim!  thanks corrinne!
nice location. all the people were great. busy but not too long of a wait. the hot towels are the best.
one of the best supercuts i've ever been too! i've been here on a few different occasions and each time my experience was great! even when it's busy the wait isn't terribly long. all of the stylist there are very courteous and extremely professional. i normally go to janet because she does the best job on my hair. i mean really this woman is a magician with clippers!!!!!! safe to say i won't be going anywhere else for my hair cuts. keep up the good work ladies.
"haircut was okay so i'd give it three stars and my barber was really sweet and nice. 2 stars because no one bothered to mention there was a check-in list so as people ahead were sitting down, i heard someone mention this list. needless to say, i asked the front desk lady, who was supposed to inform me, if there was a checkin. she said yes and checked me in...of course not after she let the people who came in after me go ahead.first chair lady definitely served her acquaintances before me. 2 as a matter of fact."
"kayla has been cutting my hair for the last year or so.  i found her by chance.  she is always pleasant, and courteous.  more  importantly, she always takes her time and does a great job.  i'm picky about my hair.  i've requested a complex scissor cut and a mixed clipper/scissor cut.  she's done great with both.  she follows directions and always aims to please.  i highly recommend her."
yesenia did an amazing job! i cut serval inches off of my hair because it was damaged from color treatments.yesenia was very kind and kept a great conversation & gave me some tips on how to keep my hair healthy in the future.she paid great attention to detail making sure my hair was cut perfectly straight & making sure i was happy with my final look! thank you! i'll definitely be back!
"ok, so have been to several sc and have had wins but lots of losses(in reference to respect to management). this location however just might have redeemed this chain/owner/franchise.frequented the location in college grove(for the love of god, keep driving and do not stop!) and needless to say the service each and every time was less than par. this combined with a rude associate led me to drive far out of the way to el cajon blvd, didn't give them much of a chance but on a whim i tried this spot and now i'm a loyal customer.for the first time in many years had a beautiful stylist give me the haircut i actually wanted without any hesitation or refusal! came out amazing and had absolutely no complaints. this was also not even. on my first or second visit here so i know this spot likes to take care of it's clients.don't be fooled as this location is right where your gps takes you. it's situated in a little side plaza by einstein bros. bagels and the rubio's (took me some driving around the first time to find it) and doesn't have any large enough sign to see from street.such a clean environment even post haircut as these ladies clean up and don't wait till it builds up. polite, talkative and fun. what's not to like?i normally get my haircut way long.in between but here can't wait to come back and get a trim just like today.enjoy the cut and don't forget to ask for your favorite stylist if they're here."
i've had the same hair stylist for almost 2 years and she never disappoints. brissia has been very helpul since the first day up until now and has a lot of patience with me :) i can't see anyone else cutting my hair. i recommend this place and brissia as your hair stylist. p.s.i'm her favorite client
"my stylist for the last couple years has been victoria.  victoria recently moved to the murphy canyon location from the more convenient location for me in pb - but i followed her.  and you would too if you let her do your do!  she is the only woman i let touch my lox - not even my ma can touch 'em.  seriously, i grew up with poker straight ugly hair with zero style. but now i get tons of compliments from both men and women.  last nite at nolita hall a woman ask me how i get my hair to look so good.  i tell them to go see vzamora @ supercuts.  and you should go see her too."
"just don't go here. went in for a bang trim and this is what i ended up with. i do not want to go back and have her attempt to ""fix"" it and make it worse. will not be returning, ever again. not happy that i even paid for this when most likely i'm going to be going somewhere else to fix this mess. skip this place!!"
i really enjoyed the managers professionalism and cooperation. we had an issue and she not only fixed the problem but exceeded my expectations. roxy is an amazing stylist and has great customer service.
"thank you roxy for the fabulous haircut and blow dry. my hair was a mess when i got to you and ever since you touched my hair, it's been so much better. it's been a week and i still even have my hair blow dried from when you did it a week ago. also thank you for the recommendations of products and the next steps. can't wait to see you again in 6 weeks for a trim!"
"awful experience. i don't know if it was just the employee i had, or an off night for this place, or if they're consistently terrible. i went in about a week and a half ago for a trim. victoria was my ""stylist."" i had scheduled an appointment online, but still had to wait about 30 minutes past that to be helped. the website did note that there might be a wait, but it felt excessively long and the two employees working didn't seem to be particularly focused on getting things moving. they were kind of just standing around joking with each other after the two customers i was waiting on had paid and left. victoria started trimming my hair, and in the middle of the cut she received a phone call. the other employee who answered the phone gave the handset to her on hold, and she proceeded to try to take it off hold, tucked it between her ear and her shoulder, and repositioned her comb and scissors to continue my cut while on the phone. this of course alarmed me, and i told her she could take her phone call and then come back to my hair later. there was no way i wanted her cutting my hair while focusing on the phone call. she just snapped at me ""i'm not going to cut it."" and then she proceeded to jab at my head with her comb while messing with the phone. she couldn't figure out how to get the phone off hold, so she kept pressing buttons, tucking the phone with her shoulder, then jabbing at my hair with her comb. this continued over and over again for a few minutes until the other employee came over to help her. once the phone issue was resolved, she hurriedly finished my trim. the worst part of this experience is how uneven the trim is, as you can see in the picture. after all that, she didn't even give me a proper hair cut, and this is after supercuts raised their prices. $21 wasted on a sloppy hair cut, and there's no way i'm going back there and letting here near my hair again."
"absolutely horrible, my hair is destroyed! i cannot believe the haircut i received! it looks like a 2 yr old cut my hair! i am livid! the experienced stylist let a very inexperienced stylist do my hair all while she sat back and watched!"
"i've been going to this location for over a year now, never been disappointed. roxy does a great job and always takes good care of me. i am very picky with my hair, and i love a super clean cut. my hard part looks always awesome and sharp. roxy has been giving me good advice on hair products and other treatments as well. an easy 5-star rating."
"roxy is great,  her cut is detailed and precise, she really listened to me , and that i appreciate, she educated me on some new products that i love!i will definitely be back in 2 months for a trim! she is one of the best!thank you , roxy, love the style!"
"clean, fast and on-point! i've gone to this supercuts for years now and have never walked away with anything but over-satisfied with the quality of service i've received.  i send all my friends to this particular store all the time... it's super clean... the stylists are top notch... very skilled and friendly.  i would recommend anyone check this place out. ps... i'm unintentionally very picky... so five stars from me!!!!"
savana gave my a super cute cute super fast! i went frommed-long hair to a super short bob. i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she replicated it!! she asked multiple times if i was comfortable with the amount she took off. loved my cut and how fast and easy it was. only waited ten mins to be seen. would defiantly come back. ask for savanna!!
"i witnesses the best customer service, above that, actual care for a customer. i was just walking in for a quick cut and one of the girls was holding and soothing a clients baby so she could finish her cut without her baby being upset. if i could give this a million stars i would! also, my cut was amazing so i will be coming back. roxy is a superstar."
"my regular hair stylist for 20 years went on vacation so i stopped in here. first i was told my hair had to be shampooed since i had hair spray in it. (i had shampooed it a few hours earlier) in 20 years at my regular place, concept salon, cutting my hair with hair spray on it was never a problem. so of course after the shampoo she cut my hair then asked how did it look. being wet i had no idea but it looked nothing like it did when i came in. i doubt many people want to look radically different when they get a haircut. as a finale she offered to sell me a gallon of shampoo.  i should have checked yelp- with 3.5 stars i would have gone somewhere else."
"my hairstylist kathleen moved to this location a few months ago so it's about time to review the location. this location has plenty of parking, is always clean, and there is a starbucks right next door if it is busy and you have a little wait. this location can get busy at peak times, so i recommend using their app to get on the list. also, i'm confident recommending kathleen to any yelper looking for a simple trim to a complex color job - she is worth the wait and there always seems to be a line of people waiting for her! she never rushes you, has great attention to detail, listens to what the customer wants, and is always bubbly and welcoming."
had an amazing experience here with a very talented hairstylist... roxy. very honest about my hair and took me thru all the steps of repairing it. awesome cut. and beautiful color. highly recommend roxy's chair. at the very least this talented crew. thank you! love my new look!
"roxy, is amazing. she is always willing to do whatever crazy idea i come up with. today she transformed into a beautiful unicorn. thank you roxy, the girls are all very welcoming, and it's it always a pleasurable experience."
"professionalism, courteous, cleanliness, and patience these are the qualities you should always look for when selecting a salon. well surprise you just found it. they do it all here. cuts, color, massage, and style. i know they offer additional services but i never looked into it. ask for roger, he is the best. periodi get the consistent high quality cut every time i see him. i'm in there every 3 weeks. i get the full package (cut, tea tree wash, and massage). the entire staff is great and a great team. they help each other ensure the customer experience is always great. i personally highly recommend this supercuts, but only if you want to leave extremely happy and have it done right the first time."
"i absolutely love barissia! she's truly incredible. after a failed cut from a lady at their location a few months prior, i decided to try again. she came to my rescue!! i have curly hair and she was able to give me an excellent cut which has always seemed impossible for other stylists. the best part is that she actually listens to you. if a style won't work, she's honest...and when it does, she freakin rocks it! that's a quality that is so appreciated. i see her, and only her now! i also bring my kids...she's our go-to gal. friendly, informative and just all around an amazing person. we love her!"
"sunday morning. time to get a trim. first time here. and i have to say: i had a great experience with cece. just beautiful cut. i've got me some long hair too that can be unruly. she handled my tresses with ease and gentleness. ahh, i luv it when my hair is happy. front desk was nice and pleasant. honestly, i have no complaints. coming back for a 2nd round when its time."
"don't let faryal cut your hair. i'm so disappointed. i walk in, and a few minutes later she tells me to sit down. i tell her i just want to trim my hair and fix it up. she just starts cutting. 5-10 minutes passes and she says all done. i've never had someone rush a haircut this fast. usually they're about 15-30 minutes. she rushed so much that i had hair all over my face when i left. she didn't even fix my sideburns.. she did such a poor job. i don't understand who hired her. she really needs to slow down and pay attention to what she's doing. moral of the story: she cuts hair way too fast and doesn't pay attention to detail. she just wants you off her chair and on to the next customer.the quicker the job, the less you get paid! take your time for gods sake."
"i've brought my son here five times to get a hair cut. five chances this place had to show that they could actually do a basic hair cut. failed miserably every time. i can overlook the fact that none of the associates there can blend a fade; my son's hair grows quick enough that it masks their ineptitude. what i can not get over, though, is not one single person in that place can cut a straight line. i literally have to go back and ask them to attempt to fix the crooked edging around his hairline. even then, it comes out no better, or worse than before. $19 plus tips for something i'm sure i could do just as good at home with a target clipper set. unbelievable. they've literally robbed me for $95, plus (unearned) tip(s)."
"i've gotten my hair done at this supercuts for 10+ years now and it's consistently better than the salons that charge $50 or more. and, yes, i have given several salons in that price range a try, but they always seem to mess my hair up. my case isn't even that complicated! that's why for my basic trim, supercuts is the best place for me.over the years a few different stylists have given me haircuts and i would recommend all of them. andrea, cecilia, and shirin are great! today, joanne trimmed my hair and she did a wonderful job too. she was very attentive to what i wanted, we had a great conversation, and she made the whole process so pleasant!i will keep coming back here. the salon is clean and the stylists are so good at what they do. where else can you get a great haircut for around $20? beats me!"
"their web app lies. the reported a 5 minute wait ended up being a 40 minute wait. this particular location is a mess. they use a 1980's system of writing names on a piece of paper then scratching them off when the customer is serviced, or they walk out in frustration. of course, the names on the paper don't actually reflect the order on who is decided to get called next. that's at the discretion of the floor manager.  when a stylist became available she would look around the room and figure out who gets called next. if you mentioned you used the app there seemed be some preference, or when someone complains and threatens to walk out they get the next stylist. a women that came after me complained and went ahead of me. if she wasn't getting her daughter's hair cut and i would have been very upset and walked out myself. i know kids get restless so i let it go.  there were apologies stating that the app never works and that causes all of their delays.. though it app seems to work fine for the escondido location. there are several negative reviews for this location,  this one is clearly rogue.- one of the lowest rated supercuts in san diego."
"don't let anybody tell you otherwise, theresa is the best and she's the only reason i have been coming to this place, 25 minutes drive each way, for over two years... you could say i am quite particular about my hair and how its cut and from the very first time i went to her, she has always done a 10/10 job. simply wonderful.she is great at listening to exactly what you want, but can help you figure it out together if you want to change things up and are not so sure what style/cut you would like done. she is always making absolutely certain that you love it and that it's perfect before you leave, and she will spend as long as it takes until you are 100% satisfied. i have never trusted someone more with my hair than i trust her and, trust me - that says a lot. theresa is the real deal!i'm a guy with medium-short hair but i have had more complex cuts and styles in the past and theresa has always been very patient with me and gotten me exactly the look i wanted. some of my family members have also been seeing her for cuts/color/etc for a long time and she is  masterful at all of it (men's and women's hair).we always leave there with a smile, looking and feeling great.theresa is a pro but she's also one of the sweetest people i know. she's by far the most requested person at this place so i recommend booking ahead for her if you can. i'd gone to fancy hair salons in the past and paid over $40 for a way subpar cut while with theresa i can get an awesome fresh cut that is perfect for a lot less, and i can be certain it will always look if i could, i would bring theresa with me across the country just to cut my hair, when i move. she's that good. make sure you ask for her when you book and you will thank me later."
visiting the area and needed an emergency haircut. arrived at 10:30 am and was told to come back at noon. back at noon and finally given to the new kid on the block who was sweet but very slow and unsure at 12:45 pm. it was a monday holiday and the place was packed which may have had something to do with the loooong wait although other reviewers have said similar things about waiting and waiting and....
i saw anna today for a root touch up. it was my first time there. she was so great!! i will definitely go back to her.
"nice place to come in and grab a simple hair cut when you are in a bind and your stylist is out. i showed the gal what i wanted and what i normally get. she quickly interrupted and said what she thought and if she just had let me finished my sentence/consultation she would have heard everything that i wanted with my hair. they did a great job cutting my hair, but sometimes, listening in the key."
no wait time and i had a relaxing time. june gave great recommendations and i'm very happy with my cut! i'll be making my next appointment here with june.
amazing amazing service!! they definitely took their time cutting my hair to make sure it was perfect. the service is extremely friendly and they really listen to their customers to make sure that they leave happy!!
"avoid this place if you can =/i came by and looking back i wish i didn't! yikes =x i could have done it better myself, that's how bad it turned out. i came by and was looking for a trim and new layers all around. the stylist was chit chatty with me and seemed like she was taking her sweet time with me cutting my locks, then all of a sudden she busts out the mirror and tells me to take a look while it was drenched wet and thick i can't see anything?! .. umm apparently she was done cutting  and i didn't even know it!??? i gave a shocked look.. i'm bad at keeping a poker face ;pthe next day it was obvious once my hair was dry that she did it super uneven and super choppy. the shortest layer on the back was super high and there were no layers in between the shortest layer and the bottom layer of my hair. and she told me if i notice anything i can come back.. ummm excuse me why would i come back so my hair can get butchered again?? no thanks! =x o.o"
actual conversation:me: i didn't wash the bleach out in time. i'm a mess. veronica: i'm sure it's not that bad. (me taking off the headband and removing tons of bobby-pins)veronica: we can fix this.    and then she did!
thank you to cecilia for the beautiful wash and blowdry today. my hair is very long and thick and you must have patience to do my hair. she takes her time and does beautiful work. i will be back and would recommend her to friends and family . don't forget to cal ahead so you don't have to wait !!
"i recently had the opportunity to be a hair ""model"" for a training session.  (apparently stylists stay up to date on trends and changes in the industry with continuing education and they occasionally need ""guinea pigs"".)   i won't lie, i was a little nervous going in, but could not have been happier with my hair cut and the whole experience. i was extremely impressed with the master stylist melissa, who facilitated the training and with the stylists, all of whom were on site for this early morning training before the salon opened for business.listening to the  stylists' questions and their sharing of collective knowledge during my hair cut really gave me a new appreciation for them and their craft.   i never realized how much goes into cutting hair... stylist's make it look so easy because they carry on relaxed conversations while they are working their magic.  i will never take a haircut for granted again. there are so many decisions to be made and specific techniques and tricks to use at every step of the haircut...and this is different for each head of hair and face. i walked out of super cuts with the one of the best haircuts i have ever gotten.  i was super surprised and super happy.  i have a new-found respect for the super cut stylists at the del mar highlands salon.  bravo!  i will be back."
"we had a terrible experience here!!! theresa. do not let her cut your hair. we came in with simple request: #2 on the sides, just clean up the top. she butchered my son's hair. she should not be allowed to cut hair. jagged razor line along side of my son's scalp, did not blend, did not trim or even cut a single hair on the top of his head at all. what a joke."
"wish i could give half a star for the rudeness of employees here!stopped by on thursday to make an appointment for friday on my lunch break. the woman told me a regular cut should take no more than 20 minutes. i confirmed this with her before i left to ensure my 2pm appointment would get me out of there in time to make it back to work. came in and checked in 2pm friday for my appointment and sat there for 15 minutes while workers partook in casual conversation with one another. as i began looking back and forth from the clock to the employees lounging around, no one said ""be right with you"" or even acknowledged my presence. when one employee was finished mindlessly chatting and called my name it was 2:17. when i asked if i would be done by 230, she and another employee sneered at me and said definitely not. when i said ""we'll i have to be at work in 13 minutes"" they stared blankly at me as if it was my fault they were engaging in conversation with one another when my appointment was supposed to begin 17 minutes prior. never coming to this location again. teenage mcdonald's employees are more professional than then the middle aged women working here!! horrible experience!"
i have been seeing andrea in this salon for years. her bubbly personality and charismatic attitude makes the salon visit something i love to do. whether it's a simple trim or a full on blonde make over she has all the skills! make sure to book asap as the girl is busy and this proves her skill in the trade. ask for andrea!
go to sherin for your cut! i always feel great whet i walk out. she does a fantastic job!
"the actual hair-cutters and/or stylists are fine. friendly and professional. but they really need to get their check-in system under wraps. it'll say 0 minute wait time, and i end up waiting for 45 minutes. it's happened 3 times in a row now. i can see other people have written about similar experiences. why can't they get this figured out? it was never a problem at the pb location. it really shouldn't be that hard...."
"can i take off a star because i hate the layout of this mall? it's so awkward!!!! i only mention it because it makes me dread going here. that aside, i came in and was introduced to marisela. what a queen. i am a cornucopia of disabilities and can not wash my own hair regularly. so i need a steady affordable place. crap. i think it's tuesday's they have discount cuts. marisela was sensitive to my needs, which required listening to me, and even hooked me up with a new do that i love!! i can guarantee you they have the cheapest prices i've come across in the city. again, double check the discount days, they're worth it. she was even kind enough to write down how she cut my hair in the event i don't get her next time. if it's up to me, it will always be her. save your money, give yourself a little hair me up and give marisela a shoutout from holly who likes the #3, round. hair cutter talk, shrug. ;-)"
"very disappointed and way overpriced.  i've come here many time for a quick trim & blow dry.  last time they massaged scalp, did a hot towel on face and asked me repeatedly how i liked the service.  this time, they rush thru, barely washed the shampoo out of my hair and was upset when i asked for a blow dry.  when i went to pay, they charged me $70!  that is full salon prices and certainly did not receive that treatment.don't waste your time or money here."
"3.5/5 starsmy husband needed a haircut and saw the supercuts sign. they were not busy so was able to walk right in after signing in on the computer. i really don't want my info on supercuts computers. we used a last initial instead and it was no problem. you can also book an appointment online which would be very handy for people who plan.the haircut was good for a good price. she was actually able to fix some problems from a former haircut. i wish i knew her name to give her credit. next time. i recommend this supercuts for a basic haircut since that's all we experienced. nothing exceptional, though. they were pleasant and had a good variety of products."
just wanna thank tamara murphy for the best hair cut i've ever had as an adult. plus i got an awesome shampoo and head massage. plus i ended upbuying the shampoo and conditioner she used. i don't live very close but next time i need a hair cut there's no place i'll be going but here. thank u again
"i was here yesterday. i hate my haircut. everything is uneven. i know i have curly hair and that's harder to cut but this is unacceptable. they get two stars because they are all nice people, i won't be back again though. at least the lady yesterday didn't aggressively try to sell me hair products."
"we have been searching for a new salon for the kids and this is it.  outstanding cuts, reasonable prices- especially on tuesdays!  the cuts are consistent, even across 3 different stylists.  we've been pleased with all of them.  it's so hard to find someone that your kids won't complain about- there's always something- she pulled too hard, it hurt, she cut my bangs too short,  etc etc.  and sometimes i have to agree .  but here, all three stylists managed to make at least this mom happy!  we will be back!"
"anytime you go to one of these ""first available stylist"" salons it's a total crap shoot with the quality of service and cut. this isn't just an issue with supercuts, but other places like sports clips too. even if you do find a good stylist, you have to go by their schedule and the good ones usually don't stay at any one location long. this location is one of the better ones because their online system is pretty reliable with only a few times i've seen ""call salon"". they also have more stylists on shift than other locations.out of 7 times i've been here i'd say 6 haircuts were fine, and one was terrible.."
"i came by today to get a trim, reshaping a prior haircut a bit shorter. aracely listened to what i wanted and delivered exactly what i asked for. very professional!"
"i explained in a very detailed manner to the hairdresser how i wanted my haircut. the hairdresser thought that a shorter version of what i wanted would look better and proceeded to cut my hair a lot more than previously accorded, without consulting me before. now my hair is extremely short and i had to go somewhere else to have an actual hairdresser fix it. very sad to know i paid for someone to do whatever they wanted with my hair especially when my hair takes so long to grow back. extremely disappointed and upset. avoid this place."
i got a really awful haircut and decided to take matters into my own hands. i ended up chopping my hair off unevenly and not leaving much to work with. i decided to give supercuts a shot. rebecca listened to what i needed and promptly fixed my hair. she was very thoughtful and made sure i was happy every step of the way. i was so happy i left a $10 tip. i'm also a girl who is picky about her hair so maybe that will give this review more substance? idk thanks rebecca
"so, i was in the area and my son needed a hair cut. christmas photos coming up(yeah we're a bit behind) anyway decided to stop by and get it out of the way. bad move. my son likes his skin fades and always gets the same cut or a variation of it. we went in and he was taken back almost immediately(yay). told the lady at the desk we wanted a fade.. i gave my son my phone to show the stylist a picture of what we wanted(a skin fade with a hard part). she looked and said okay and walked back with my boy. he followed her with my phone still in hand so i called him back to give it back to me. the stylist looks back and says she needs the picture to cut his hair. that should've been my sign to go ahead and ask for another stylist. i've never had a stylist take my phone with them to stare at a picture while they faded his hair. anyway i had forgotten my glasses in the car and was wearing my prescription sunglasses inside. visibility was no good from where i was sitting. i decided to get my glasses out of the car really quick and as soon as i got back(about a minute later) i had a pretty clear view of what was happening to my sons head. it was looking really off. i hate being rude but good lord the woman does not know how to fade. i was asked if it was good so i took the opportunity to walk back and see the mess up close. it was bad. i asked why it looked so chunky at spots and she replied ""that's the fade.""woah wait no, nothing about a fade is chunky or bald spotty. it fades. i responded that i knew what a fade was, he's been getting fades since he was 2. and then the hard part.. the line was not a line. it was a weird curve thing. i asked her why it wasn't straight. i grabbed my phone from my son and showed her the picture and asked how that looked at all like the picture. she then said, ""i didn't look at the picture when i did the line."" say what? she took my phone and had my son hold it just so ""she didn't look at it."" ?!?!? then said, ""that line is easier than what i did."" well that's just nice, why wasn't it done then? i wanted a simple straight line. i don't care what level of line you ""think"" you can do. give what was asked. anyway she then asked what she could do to make it better. man, i didn't know what to say besides actually fade his hair. i didn't have words so i walked away and just waited for her to finish. once she brought him out, all nice and butchered i looked over at his disaster haircut. i wasn't going to let the kid walk around looking like that and asked for someone else to fix it. luckily the manager came out and took him back and started to actually fade his hair. there wasn't much she could do about the horribly done hard part but she at least faded his hair the right way so thank you for that. we weren't charged which was why i gave 3 stars and not 2. word to the wise coming here, ask and make sure the stylist even knows what a fade is before you let them go at it. and to the stylist who cut his hair, next time please don't pretend you can do something you can't and end up butchering someone's hair. it's okay to pass on a client to someone who knows what they're doing. thanks."
"came by on my lunch and with a limited time to get my hair cut and luckily they had immediate openings. the store apparently had been pretty slow all morning, but soon after i walked in, it started to pick up. ashlyn trimmed my hair, its very long right now and had a ton of split ends so i told her all i needed was a few inches cut off and layers around my face. between the wash and the cut i was in and out in under 20 min! i am not even totally certain that she cut everything, but she swears she did. she used a few products in my hair and showed me what she used, both seemed nice! for now, i am super happy with my cut, although i have literally never had someone cut it so quickly. i heard the girl next to me say the same thing to the lady cutting her hair, so it seems like that's how they do it. cheaper cuts but they get you in and out quick. i have no complaints about that as long as its a good cut (which so far i think so, but will update this if i am wrong). cant complain about getting my hair done quick and easy and on the cheap (25$ is really nothing!!). thanks to ashlyn!!"
"i had an issue with a stylist few months back and had to rant my problems here.  since then, the owner reached out to me to personally apologize and offer me a chance to give them another chance.well i had the chance to go back twice so far and i have to say the two other styles were on top of their game.  they were one of the best styles i've had; they made sure the cut was what i wanted, catered to my style, asked questions and made sure i was happy before leaving the establishment.  these ladies know how to take care of their clients and experts in the way they handled all aspects of the business.thank you to the two stylists; ashlyn and tammy.  you both were wonderful!"
"i live in mission valley and was looking to get a haircut. gave supercuts a shot and can honestly say i haven't gone anywhere else since! super easy to put your name on the list via the app (or call ahead) so you don't need to sit and wait...or you can just walk right in, they have plenty of stylists so the wait is never really that long. i always request tamara, the manager, because she is super friendly and upbeat and simply knows what i want! but all the ladies here are friendly and know their stuff. treat yourself...get the scalp massage. :)"
i love this salon. it's always painless and quick! manager is very professional & friendly. i always recommend this particular supercuts to all my friends because it truly is great. every stylist has to go through vigorous training and it shows.
"the girl with the colorful hair did my our kids cut and it looks great, very happy with service and price and there was zero wait. $16 haircut and his hair grows fast so this was a great deal for us, we're happy and will be back"
i got very disappointing hair cut..the lady i got does not kno even how to cut. she is very unprofessional. i definately not go again this place.
"stylist miss ashlyn has done my hair the last several visits and she has an amazing touch and always nails the cut i ask for. miss ashlyn has a very kind demeanor and i'll bet that she makes all of her clients feel as if they are in caring and skilled hands.i brought my girl miss dana in yesterday for a major do-over and gave miss ashlyn carte blanche to do as she wished with miss dana's very long hair. an hour later, we left the salon as pleased as we possibly could. this salon appears to be extremely well-staffed and managed.thank you, supercuts, miss ashlyn and management"
"went in to get a little off the top, not almost all. told the lady twice just a little bit!! clean haircut, but not what i wanted."
"i very rarely leave reviews, for any business. but there are ""special"" occasions in which i feel they are warranted, good or bad. this is a mixture of both. i'll start off by saying that the lady that cut my hair was very nice. she also did a great job and my hair really looks good. the issue that i have is quite simple. i had a very strong gel in my hair and when the stylist went to run the clippers through it she felt it best to wash my hair. sure, sounds reasonable.... so i get my hair washed, she's explaining the shampoo and conditioner and even offers me a scalp massage. i get it, she's doing as most businesses do and that's to try and upsell me. i have no problem with that. the problem comes when i go to pay. my $20 haircut is now $24! i'm not worried about $4, i even still tipped the lady. the problem i have is that this additional charge was never mentioned. i wasn't asked if it was ok. i wasn't even told that is costs $4 to wash my hair. it was simply not mentioned. i feel this is a little deceitful. i think customers should be informed anytime that additional charges are going to be added to their bill. overall i was happy with the experience. clean place, good conversation, great haircut. i at least know now that if i decide to go back to make sure i ask, and not assume, that my $20 haircut will end up being $20. i appreciate the offer, ryan. i figured this was an oversight by the staff. i also could've asked and not assumed. it's really not that big of a deal and i certainly don't expect any sort of compensation for it. again, the overall experience was good. friendly staff and a good haircut. thanks again for the offer."
very good customer service!!! my son comes here every time he needs haircut. they pay attention what you like to have it done. friendly place and very pleasant.
"boyfriend got a haircut and after continuously explaining to the women that he wanted a fade and to not round off his head this is what happened. it was worse, he told her to fade it more and this is what he ended up with. waste of money."
"totally hit or miss. today i took my 4 year old son to get his haircut. each time i ask for it to stay longer on top and clean up around the ears.bravo maria for giving thomas the best haircut ever!!!this was a hit day.btw... this location is always super tidy, and everyone is friendly. at the end of haircuts they give the kiddos a lollipop!!!"
"went in for a cut with my son on sunday 8/19/18. $37 for 2 haircuts. well first off right off the bat they screwed my son's head up. i asked for a short fade one on the side 2 on the top and he has patches all through the sides of his head or they did not know how to fade properly. secondly when we went to leave i went to pay with my credit card $37 for 2 haircuts and i left a $14 tip in cash. the receipt they printed me out said $37 on it. my bank sends me text messages immediately when a transaction goes through so before i walked out of the store i had a text message saying supercuts in charge me $44.40. so i showed them this and asked where the $7.40 went did they add a tip without my permission what is it can you explain they told me no they told me that my information was wrong and they charged me what the receipt shows. well my bank doesn't lie and the receipt shows what it's supposed to but the transaction that went through on the bank is $7 more than the receipt shows so you guys stole my money. i have reported it as fraud and open investigation through the bank. i have my receipts the pictures and video from inside your store the way your employees handle the situation. i sincerely hope that someone from the corporate office sees this and contacts me to rectify the situation. not only should be store manager and employees should have training how to better handle situations like this, they should also have more training and customer service. will never return the supercuts"
"i got a fabulous ""haurcut"" at this location. no, i didn't request that one part be about half an inch longer than the rest but that's what i got. stuff happens and i'm a man so in the end i just smash it into place but a simple fade is the first haircut that you learn how to do. would give less stars if possible"
shahrzad gave me a really good haircut. she was really patient and cool despite of me being really freaky about my hair. happy with the haircut.thank you shahrzad.
update- got a cut from an asian lady (not dana) and currently am very happy with it. we will see how it turns out :) :) :)
jenny is amazing here! i first went here a few months back and was lucky enough to get jenny. i have been going back to her about once a month ever since. she is so friendly and engaging. she is a 10/10!!!
after 4-5 haircuts here i have to say this place is a disaster.  each time i go home and shower and no matter who cuts my hair i have piece of hair sticking out everywhere.  not to say many other places in santa clara area better.  i think santa clara is the bermuda triangle of haircuts.  only a few good places and you can tell they are good because they are completely booked.  definitely a huge gap to fill if anybody can bring a decent organization to the area.
"hit or miss period. they have couple of experienced hair stylist, the rest are just always new. high churnprice is competitive and you do get your appointment in a very timely manner- don't have to wait long"
"wish there was a negative star option. got a hair cut from here the lady was foreign, not asian i forgot her name. doesn't matter but this lady cut my hair and i have never been so disappointed in a hair cut. my hair is extremely choppy and it doesn't blend together what so ever. do not trust these people. they ruined my hair. first off cut it way too short when i hadn't asked them to cut off so many inches. second they were so inaccurate with copying the hair style i had suggested. and third let me walk out with the most ugliest hair cut i have ever had. so dissatisfied and so upset. never coming here again and i will make sure anyone i know will never come here."
"ionica did a lovely and efficient job shaping up my straggly ends into a bob that tapers under nicely. i've also had a cut by niloufar and color by phuong and maria. all did a great job.will definitely return for friendly, reliable service at a great price point."
"the most excellent service.  i bring my disabled son, who is in a wheelchair.  my son is not an easy cut .  but all the staff know my son's name and greet him with smiles every time.  i especially want to thank stylist fariba naji.  fariba is not only the best stylist at the shop.  she always goes above and beyond to help my son.   fariba, jimmy says hi and thank you for all that you do for him!  mu family highly recommends this shop.  if i could give 10 stars i would!"
i visit this super cuts even though its 5 miles away from home just because of phoung. she is amazing. not sure if she quit that place. if she did then its a bummer. went today and looks like entire staff has changed. ionica was my stylist. 1. she look stressed out. 2. zero customer service. at times sounded rude.3. she screwed up my hair. cut more on on one side then the other. finishing was pathetic. my hair looks like someone chewed it on the side. i will not visit this place again if phoung is not around.
i recommend phuong to everyone. she really can give you the hair you want or even better. :)she is very kind and professional. give her a chance and you will chose her to be your only hair-specialist.
"place is ok, nothing extremely awesome in hair cut they do, some of personnel is not really friendly and always in rush, and i noticed that in other locations, not bad place at all if u live close by and don't want make a reservation and wait for better quality and pricy locations"
"my sons have had a few good and some very bad haircuts (and bad experiences) here. not all of the stylists understand what a ""sports haircut"" is, and many take nothing off. a waste of time in some cases. they should train their newer people better. the people are all nice. their wait area is small. good location. but their haircut results are mixed (some good, many not so good)."
"not happy about the haircut or color service here. i asked for 2 inches off, there goes 4 inches instead. when it came to picking a color to even out my hair color and hide the highlights i got at a different salon back in february the girl wasn't confident with any color suggestions. when i was waiting for the color to set (which she left on for way too long) she kept saying ""i wonder if it will turn out good"" - not what you want to hear when you're getting permanent color... the color turned out much too dark for my complexion and was way over priced for just a supercuts salon. would not come here again for any hair services!"
i was charged 18 dollars for a simple haircut. plus tips.& it wasnt perfect. never going back there .
sue was great. had a hair cut and shampoo. she was really such a nice person. love to be here again.
"woah, what a convenient location considering what surrounds the area. there were two stylists there and little to no wait on a friday afternoon. i was able to get in and out within a fairly good amount of time. overall for what i paid ($20) and tip, i felt as if it could have turned out a little better. 4 stars for locations.maybe a different stylist next time around."
"not sure about other super cuts but this location is great for kids' cuts. great service , inexpensive cuts, and convenient location. i've been bringing my son here for almost a year and he gets a great cut every time. previously, i've taken him to ""real"" barbershops hoping for quality cuts. after seeing how quickly his hair grows/ how often he needs a cut, i figured i'd give something like this a try. this location is within walking distance from us so it's very convenient.after seeing how great his first cut here was from ana(she's no longer here), i figured we just got lucky with the stylist. after the first visit, he's had a different person cut his hair each time and it came out just as good. i believe the kids cut cost about 18 or so. it's a great place for a quick cut for boys."
i can't recommend this place!!! only if you want ugly haircut and wearing hat next 2 month (minimum)!!! in the pictures my husband with his new haircut!
"worst service forever. they cannot even do an easy blow out. they took forever, pulled my hair hundred of times and at the end my hair is still messy and i paid 50 bucks for it. they even asked me for a tip. will never go back again."
"i have been here a few times as it is close to work and i can walk over during lunch when it is not very crowded. the people who work here are polite, but the barbers failed to do what i asked for specifically. i have never had this problem at other barber shops. also the place was hot the last time i went here."
"worst experience ever. don't come to this place and waste your money. i did hair color and trim. the hair stylist left a lot of stains on my face, and didn't give me a towel after washing my hair. and they charged me extra 20 dollars for just a trim. i picked this place just because it's the closest to my apartment but the experience was so bad. never ever come back."
"i want this place to succeed some of the stylist can cut hair here but really you have to train your front office desk not just to be robots and idiots and create big lines and tell people to sit down when there's no place to sit come on, stupid cats get it right you can make a lot more money and make a lot more customers happy if you just get your front desk right. no excuse make it a user-friendly experience and watch your business grow come on supercuts, help me out."
"-friendly and attentive staff -clean and bright shopthe stylist, chelsea, knew exactly how to cut my bf's hair (combover). she listened attentively and repeated back how he wanted it cut. styled it really nice too."
"talk about nickle and dime-ing you to death!!! yesterday i called and asked how much a women's haircut cost.  they quoted me $18.95. upon entry to the establishment, kathy asked me if i wanted my hair washed. i thought nothing of it and said, ""sure, why not"". my hair had been in a bob style, and i did not particularly like the way the front was longer than the back, so i asked her to fix it and make it all one length. she kept cutting and cutting and cutting... at the end she proceeded to blow-dry my hair; somehow i thought that this was done for her to see if she had missed any stray hairs in her layering my hair and that it was included in the haircut. i told her that my hair was naturally wavy/ curly and that there was no way for me to style it by blow drying it or using a straight iron. kathy proceeded to blow dry and straighten my hair anyway. the outcome of all this? i was charged $6 for the shampoo, $18.95 for the haircut and $12.95 for the blow dry-- a total of $35+!! what's more, i left there looking like a guy with longish hair, far from anything like a bob. the closest thing that i can describe my hair to look like is a messed-up dorothy hammill. and it is so short that i am going to have to live with it for over a year!!! i want to scream. this is the last time i am going to supercuts. the reason i went there in the first place was because it is a chain and i was depending on being understood by someone who spoke english better than the place i normally go to. i guess that's what you get for letting someone who's native language is not english."
very nice that you can come here every time during the day. no appointment needed. this spot quite busy but they will allow you for hair cut just in 10-15 min. good for those people who don't expect to much from average pricing barberry shop. fast and easy. friendly personnel
"they are open at 9 am in the morning. i came in at 9:03 am. i was the 3rd person while the first two just got started. people who came after me would get the service. they call out names of people with appointments which is logical, but when the people are not present, they would still not call who is sitting there. couple of people who cane after me would get the service without the appointment. i got a feeling they are discriminating me by my race. just because they are not indians they would get service without appointments. bunch of racist creatures. and when you ask, the people say, oh did you come? we didnt notice, you are next. if you have appiintments lined up, you could have told me we are fully booked for morning or something. instead you made me wait and insulted me by not treating equal to other customers without appointments. it is 9:50 am now, i missed 1 hour and you have 3 saloonists who served 9 customers so far before me. i could have gone to another center. and if i  am really not the next, then i would rather do it. this is the second time i have a complaint on this center. first time my girlfriend wrote a review on behalf of me. and they call me and give me a coupon with a sorry. and made sure they wouldnt guve such treatment again. this time it is slightly different issue but still the same ridiculous behavior."
this review is for kathelyn who did a tea tree scalp massage and blow dry for me today. she really took her time to massage my scalp with the right pressure and style my hair with care all the while talking to me about what i liked. i'd like to see her again soon. services like scalp massage are usually hit and miss. i came out feeling better than i went in. all for just $22+ tips. i could do it every day!
absolute joke management with zero accountability. dont expect them to honor your reservation. i would avoid at all costs.
"have been visiting this salon off lately. staff is very friendly, never impatient or in a hurry which is why i prefer this salon."
this place was superb when rich was here but after he is gone this is down the drain.if anybody knows where rich is working now please let me know.
"first time i have them benefit of the doubt, maybe i didn't explain what i want. the second time it was pretty clear, they don't understand english, only know to cut hair as short as possible and then try to sell someproducts. stay away"
"pretty disappointed. my usual hair stylist was closed, but i had a hankering for a haircut so i stopped by here because it was the only place open. a middle aged woman had helped me.points of displeasure -texted throughout the haircut -rough with my head-haircut was mediocre in general -didn't bother to dry off my hair- didn't even acknowledge me after i paid. just had me sign and walked away. didn't give me a receipt  or that usual thank you or whatever.for $18 + tip, definitely not worth it. i've had better service from a $10 haircut salon. i definitely don't reccomend this place."
"i've been going to lynn for a year now and she is the best hairstylist i've ever had. the first time she cut my hair, i got lots of compliments from friends and coworker about the great job she has done, so i kept going to her and she always does amazing.she gives suggestions and listens to mine and she's extremely personable. during the haircut, she pauses for feedback while there is still time for course correction, and tells me exactly what she did to my hair so that next time she will know what worked.lynn is awesome, super friendly and very professional. i can highly recommend her!"
this is the last straw. i'm done with this place. even just 2 years ago i was so down to get ma haircut here. things have changed... the staff has clearly changed from the first several times i've been here. the workers are now mid aged asian women who have very limited knowledge of how to get it right. i get ma head shaved completely and ask to be lined up... the women says okay and cuts a straight line down. strike one. i later notice after i leave that she didn't line me up at all and in fact one corner of my forehead is now slightly farther back than the other. so my face looks slightly disfigured now... -______-not coming back!
"i'd like to give zero stars! we walked in and immediately the stylist already cutting someone's hair asked in a rude tone if i had called ahead. i said no (as i didnt know you needed to). she says again in a snotty tone that the wait is an hour and a half. i said ok. and she then said we had to wait there. it was as if she wanted to scare us into not getting a haircut there! and to think, we had never been there before so that was our first impression of that place! needless to say, we left."
"my friends and i have been coming here for budget-friendly cuts for over a year. for a trim or simple cut, you can't beat the value for your dollar.recently, i've had my hair cut by stephanie twice. she not only gave me great-looking layers, she also has a very pleasant and chill presence. i appreciated her double checking the trim length with me in the mirror and asking how i liked my hair throughout and so on. my hair is tricky because it's damaged and hard to work with. both times she was able to give me the cut i hoped for on top of helping me achieve healthier hair.thanks, stephanie!"
one of the better supercuts. i go here from time to time for a cheap trim. i don't know her name but she's a vietnamese lady and did a great job keeping my hair long but chopping off enough to get rid of my split ends. i was happy with her cut. i don't ever feel pressure here to buy anything which is nice. also plenty of parking. wait is never more than 10 min on weekends.
"pretty bad service. haircut took almost twice as long as they usually did at the old supercuts palo alto which i miss and the lady helping me never said a full sentence to me which made it very hard to communicate what i wanted. a haircut is a detailed thing and anyone giving one should be able to communicate more clearly than with a ""this ok?"" and a gesture. the lady cutting my hair had to get this other hair cutter to come finish off my haircut. i didn't ask for anything complicated or unusual! shouldn't they be trained in a school on this not in a retail shop? miss the palo alto location people there were always at least workable and they usually made sure they were clear on what i wanted ."
good cut for my son. quick and efficient and the woman was nice and friendly. expensive though.
"went in a few months back; had pre-scheduled an appt. on their app, and everything was going ok until the cut was done and i decided after review that i needed more cut off.  the stylist was a bit perturbed and kept saying over and over 'ok, so you're changing what you originally told me'....i tried to ignore her as it was obvious she was trying to guilt me out of changing my mind.  she then said if she was to have to start all over, she'd have to charge me for another haircut, and then pointed to the people waiting and mentioned that they'd all have to wait longer now too (definite guilt trip)!  i said forget it, paid and left.  i have never had a stylist or salon do this to me before - what's the point of having you check your haircut afterwards with two different mirrors and ask you if it's ok if clearly the idea is that they don't want to hear anything but 'yes'?!  i had been going to this supercuts for years until now....i won't be back."
horrible customer service the hours are until 8. i came in at 7:50 with an emergency i son cut a big chunk of his hair off. i walked in and asked if they were closed the two girls said no so i said can i just quick cut for my son since he had school tomorrow and after say no they are getting ready to close and went on with the conversation they were having. horrible customer service!!
"oralia did a great job.great cut, very professional ... even did my eye-brows!keep up the good work"
"after coming here for over 10 years and having decent but inconsistent hair cuts, the last cut broke the camel's back. i asked for a scissor cut and then she bluntly says, ""i'll use the trimmer and a comb"" and then proceeds to lop off a bunch of hair. i'm not sure why she asked me how i normally get it cut if she couldn't care less. in the end, i'm almost 49 years old and i came home with a frickin mullet. i am resolute that i will never go back to this supercuts and probably never to any supercut again. the bad haircut is one thing, but to be disrespected and to have bad service is enough. go elsewhere."
"$53 for a haircut?!  i may as well have gone back to aveda salon on santana row.when my normal hair stylist at aveda moved to texas, i decided to ask some co-workers for recommendations.  inocencia at supercuts was recommended to me.  i haven't been to a supercuts in a while, but i figured i would give it a try, because my co-worker has great hair.  inocencia gave me a great haircut.  if she ever changes salons, i would be happy to go back to her.  but when i went to pay for my haircut, i was in for an unpleasant surprise.  the price of a haircut on the board was $18.95.  i decided to treat myself and get the shampoo ($5) and blowdry ($12).  so my total bill should be $35?  right?  but when i checked out, the cashier and manager told me i had ""style and blowdry""  (a what?) not a regular blow dry which was way down on the bottom of the price list not anywhere near the haircut package i thought i was getting.  a ""style and blowdry"" costs $35.   how this makes any sense, i have no idea.  so they said my bill was $18.95 plus $35 = $53.  why is a blow dry more expensive than a haircut?  how was i supposed to know there is a difference between blow dry types (i just got it done straight, no fancy wedding hair.)   inocencia was in agreement and tried to support my case, but we both lost.  and guess what supercuts?  you lost too because i will never go back to a supercuts ever again.   my aveda cut and blowdry cost $65 but i also got a massage in the package and the experience was much better.  i will be going back to aveda in the future -- inocencia, maybe you should join me there!"
"firstly, service was friendly. got my hair cut by tina. she did a great job and listened to what i wanted."
"got my hair cut by emma on tuesday.  she did a great job.  listened to what i wanted, looked at pictures that i brought of different cuts i liked, suggested cuts that would be good for my hair type and facial features.  she just doesn't cut hair, she's a great stylist.  prices are cheap, the place was clean and the staff friendly."
i've been coming here for a deep conditioning treatment with marcela since oct and she has worked miracles with my hair! it's is so much healthier and she has helped me keep it long and healthy! i never have to wait too long and the staff is always friendly.
"i get a no frills hair cut and try to be very specific about what i want and 80% of the time i am pretty happy with my cut. it is the times when i am feeling lazy and don't really care that my head gets askew.for the price and convenience, i am really happy with this location and expect what i pay for when i take the time to explain what i want.i like the call ahead feature and now that i found my favorite stylist, when she is in the country i can get a decent cut.whoo hoo."
"this is pretty hit or miss place. first time was good, second time was terrible -- hair cut was uneven and i had to fix it up at home, as i was rushed out when more potential customers started lining up for haircut. it's $17.95 for a full haircut. pretty dissatisfied with this particular place."
"thank you crystal! don't leave without having ""the tea tree experience"". my stylist crystal was kind enough to suggest this amazing addition to the standard shampoo. tingly tea tree shampoo along with a hypnotically relaxing scalp massage, finished off with a steaming towel face wrap and i felt like floating! i wish i could have one every day, like getting a spa treatment at supercuts. of course the haircut was perfect too,  she took care to be sure i had exactly what i wanted done and that i was happy before i left. i will definitely be back!"
"i went here yesterday and i wanted more than a standard haircut, i wanted a jet-black coloring job.   the stylist who took care of me, sarene, had over 20 years of hair styling experience, said it wouldn't be a problem. turns out, she knew exactly what she was doing.  because i'm just reaching the age when my hairline is starting to recede a bit at the temples, she cut it in exactly the best way to maximize the look of my hair and was careful with applying the right solutions in the right proportions to keep the dye in my hair and off my skin.she was sweet the whole time and did a lot of little things to assure my comfort, saying nice things like how good it was to be pampered, complimenting my looks, and giving me a scalp massage during pre-treatment and another when the color rinsed out, and the ""tea tree"" treatment which helped lock in the color.  she also recommended an excellent product to keep my colored hair healthy afterward, and i'm very pleased with her work and look forward to going back for a touch-up and future treatments.  the whole process took about 1.5 hours and was reasonably priced at $45 for the color job plus $10 for the tea tree treatment.i made sure to tip her generously for her work, because she totally deserved it!this place does take appointments, so if you're planning on a great cut, style, or color, i would call and ask specifically for sarene's service.and if you're a member of aaa, don't forget to bring in your card to get a 20% discount on everything, services and products alike, something you will need to ask for as they don't tell you about it up front.they also have a ""cut card"" where you get stamped every time you come in and your 13th cut is free.  but again, you will need to ask for it, or ask them to stamp it if you've already got one."
"first off, the service was friendly. the lady welcomed me with a warm welcome and made sure that i was being helped. now to the haircut. for $17, the haircut was a good quality, the cut being pretty even. although, the upper right side of my head has a small patch of hair that the hairdresser did not touch, even after i told her that it needed to be trimmed. lastly, she gave me a warm towel to wipe the excess hair that was on my face during the cut. all in all, the experience was great and the place looked amazing, but since one side of my hair is uneven, i give it three stars. i would recommend this place to anybody who wants a simple, quick, and inexpensive cut!!!!"
"is $130 for a haircut and highlights too much? i have long hair and have never gotten high lights before and wanted to go somewhere ""cheap"" this doesn't seem cheap. and it's gonna take 3 hours... oy vey.  and they don't have color samples i just have to trust they know what they're doing...at least it sounds like they do. we'll see, i'm waiting for the girl to get her coffee before she starts :-/"
went here for the first time last week to chop all of my hair off (kind of a scary thing!) luckily marcela was awesome and walked me through everything super patiently. i will definitely be coming back just for her... recommended!
"i went to this supercuts once and had a terrible haircut. i complained to supercuts and they were great around giving me a voucher for a new haircut. i went again to this same location and again had an awful experience. i normally get a buzz cut. somehow each time i get this simple cut here, they miss 40% of the hairs on my head and make it look terrible. my regular supercuts in campbell does an excellent job. not sure why this particular store is consistently bad."
"omg charlene is the best!! moved to south bay last year and have be putting off...and off...and off...the oh so inevitable search for ""the one"". and i found her! she is really knowledgeable, and she knew exactly what i wanted, and i am so happy to have given this little store a chance. thank you charlene! see you soon =)"
"honestly one of the worst haircuts ive had so farthe indian lady who cut my hair messed up my hairline on my left forehead and in an attempt to fix it, messed up my right forehead hairline too.nothing but a nightmare, wouldnt reccommend to anyone"
grace magic hairdresser - polite and very friendly. very highly recommended.
my boyfriend and i came here the other day and i definitely don't recommend it. they didn't cut my boyfriend's hair the way he wanted to and they cut my hair much shorter than i initially wanted; giving me layers. and we both specially told the women how we wanted our hair done.
"grace is my haircut hero, she found a cut that fits me since the first time i visited this location. i don't understand why no one told me before that what my hair needs thinning  scissors only."
grace is the reason why i continue to come! she takes care of my son and recently she shampoo'd and blew-dried my long hair and it was an amazing experience.  my hair made it through the day and wind! thank you grace! loved it!
i had a great experience at super cuts. shahrzad gave me a great haircut and she was so friendly as well. i definitely recommend this place.
grace is amazing and cuts extremely well! was happy with my hair cut. their cool attitude was a big plus! will be seeing you soon!
i went there today with my sister and we both felt that we were cheated big time! grace charged us twice that of the amount promised. very sloppy job of shampoo and quick less than 2 mins massage.one star is for the blow drying job only. this branch needs to teach their staff for better communication and honesty.
jackie's awesome! i checked in before leaving my house and only had to wait for 15-20 minutes. she made sure i like the length before she cut and listened to my requests instead of talking me out of them. she also styled my hair for free just because she's not busy. i would come back again & i highly recommend her if you go. thank you jackie!
today i went in for the hair color and the hair cut. jacky helped me with everything and she did a great job. all the staff are super friendly and nice! it's so funny cause i was at the store when those two ladies came inside and got their hair blow dried! they both had tick hair and took so much time of grace's and she already gave them discounts. it's so sad how some people like to take advantage of others and not show appreciation! anyways my husband and i always go to that supper cut even through it's far from where we live cause of their friendly staff and awesome job they all do. thanks jacky and the entire staff for taking good care of your customers!
"i've been going here for a couple years because it's close to work and love the staff. grace, jackie, and everyone i've had has been professional and they all do a great job."
this is the only place i will come to get my haircut. jacky is the best!!! i followed her here from another location because she is so great! jacky remembers things about me even though i am not so good about coming to see her as often as i should. she is always happy to see me and makes me feel like an old friend or even a member of the family.when i first saw her a few years ago i told her that i need to wash and go because i am what i call blowdryer illiterate. i have said this to stylists in the past and before i met jacky thought i liked my haircuts. she gave me the best cut i have ever had in my life!!! she also picked my hair color for me and i love it!!!!! it is the perfect color for me. she has also helped me with selecting hair products that are best for me. jacky is amazing.
been to this supercuts for years and grace has been absolutely amazing. she remembers how i like my hair cut and she always has an awesome attitude. she brightens everyone's day and makes this a great experience.  i highly recommend this place and especially grace!
i have curly hair and hardly satisfied with any of the haircuts i get. actually i'm a bit picky about my hair style. a friend of mine recommended sherri on this branch of super cuts. i thought to myself it worth trying... and i think finally i find my hair stylist! she is really skillful and i finally got the haircut i wished for many years. i think she really deserves a five star review. thank you so much sherri!
"as much as i like some of the hair dressers here, it is just ridiculous if you have to wait for an hour, even after an appointment. if you value time this is not the place.update: i did get the haircut after the wait and am very happy with it. they gave me a $2 credit, i understand it is a token, no issues, it's not the money as my tip was more than it.i understand some customers may come in for some service and then decide for more which can take extra time. but then let the customers with reservation know the reality so they can plan. in my case 39 min after the time reserved i even offered to reschedule to a different time or day as i had to take my daughter for soccer. i was told 5 min more which ended up lot longer. there are way better ways to handle customers: both who demand more service than initially asked and ones who booked online thinking they can avoid long wait. recommendation to business - value your customers. you have some good hair dressers but if you cannot provide proper customer service you'll loose customers like me. i was a loyal super cuts on prospect rd customer till they messed up with service on several occasions. please don't stoop to that level and fix the issues."
"grace is a world class hair stylist and star of this location. jackie, another stylist at this location initially gave me a bad haircut and i had to go back to get it fixed. grace fixed my haircut for free and transformed the original bad haircut into an extremely good haircut. grace's skills and customer service are both top notch. they should give a promotion and raise to grace for her excellent skills, customer service and for making up for the faults of others on the team."
"i visited super cuts for the first time. very happy with the layered haircut and blow dry. my hairstylist was very friendly and she did a very good job. i thought this place is cheaper, but i paid $55 for haircut plus $5 for tip. its the same i used to give in ulta.  but still i am happy with the hair style"
"couldn't even understand the blonde lady cutting my hair. she had big glasses. waiting for about 45 minutes for a trim. i asked for a trim with shampoo and blow dry and assumed the blow dry would cost about the same as the shampoo. no one told me the price. blow dry was $50 wtf and took over an hour to wash, cut my hair one inch, and blow dry. when she was washing my hair she scrubbed the dye out of my hair and got my face shirt and arms all wet. 10/10 will not go back again"
"been here twice with my boys.   they just don't care.  our first time, the haircut was sloppy on my older son who wanted his hair crewcut.  they had no idea what that was.   the second time, was for my younger son who has lovely long hair.  he wanted it trimmed for his halloween costume.  i specifically told the lady to please cut an inch off the back and give him a layer.  i turn around and she's butchering his hair with the clippers.  i don't get it, don't all people who cut hair know what layers are?  my son was in tears and i was close to them.   that was the last time i'll go!  i asked her what she was doing and she was so clueless and didn't care either!  seriously go somewhere else.  i know supercuts isn't the most quality but this is beyond bad."
"this was my 2nd time going to this supercuts location. customer service wise not too great. there were about 4 ladies just working on stocking up products not even caring who comes in the store. i got seated right away with a asian male stylist. at 1st i was quite skeptical because i couldn't really understand his english, but i showed him a photo of what i wanted and explained to me he couldn't do it like that and instead did his best to cut the way i want it. overall he did an amazing job. for the price is just perfect. instead of going to those salons to have a haircut for $50 and such i got mine for $19."
"i have been going to coleman super cutsfor 3 yrsalway had good hair cutsbut this last cut was horriblewent there 2 times but but same old asian lady was there,so i went in there today,7 days later to get someone else to trim it up and wes refusedif there was a negative 2 i would use itthe girl agreed but the manager said no!!!would only take 6 min or soso much for satisfeid customersi will never go there again................"
"if yvonna was still there it would be 5 stars for sure.  she always did a great job every time, and did a perfect fade.  haven't found anyone there that can do a good a job as her."
"the guy that cut my hair was kind of short with me.  i was looking for some advice and he kind of just barked questions at me.  i got my haircut and it's not really what i was looking for and it wasn't even styled, just cut and air dried.  i'm not happy at all honestly, i just wasted $25 and about to spend even more to get it fixed at a place that gives a shit."
vanessa cut my hair and was very professional and accommodating. she knew what i was talking about when i had a request for my hair line. i noticed the way she cleaned her station before she called me too. she thoroughly cleaned every razor head with a brush and tapped it on the counter to ensure all hair was removed. she sprayed sanitizer on both sides of each item she had used: laying everything down and then flipping it over for each spray. she also greeted every customer that walked in and let them know someone would be attending them soon.
"i am giving 1 stars for the worst hospitality and also for the dumb asian hairdresser i have ever seen in my life. using asian as i don't know her name. the reason for my bad review is because even saying her to cut only an inch from the existing hair, she went ahead on her own left me with such a short hair. on top of it, it took months to grow the beard and i regret asking for beard trim. i asked her to have it little structured and ended up loosing my beard style. she was not able to even tell the difference on what goof up she did. my left side was way up than right. and when she fixed left, it wasn't a surprise that now right was way upper than left."
"absolutely the worst quality haircut ive ever had... the younger blonde woman that has the station by the register moves way too fast and doesn't communicate on what she's doing. i'm 45 years old and i get my haircut every two weeks, i think i have it down pat on the instructions i give and what i expect when it's done . they were not busy and there was no reason for her to rush so quickly. if you want a different haircut every time you go there this is the place for you."
"just called for an appointment at 5:30pm. easy. asked for layers with a ""deep v"" back but it wasn't ""v"" enough. whatevers. i came in knowing that where ever i go to get my hair cut, my hair will be chopped off half the length (my hair reached my belly button, now it's at my clavical). i'm pretty sastified since the price for a hair cut was just $19.99. great service, nice workers and in and out in 40 mins."
"cynthia is an angel. she salvaged my hair in under an hour. i'd gone to a different chain for colour the day before and my hopeful summer ombré dreams were squished with a bad blend and super bad damage on the ends.cynthia recommended a protein treatment and gave me the cut i wanted. she was so fun to talk to and we swapped salon horror stories. when she was finished i could move my fingers through my hair again. my hair instantly felt better. it still needs to be babied for a while, but i feel like i can go out in public now. thanks, cynthia!"
"i call in, they tell me to come in and when i do, they tell me they don't have time.i try to make a reservation for the next day they won't let me! they only take same day reservations.i come in, they tell me to wait 30 min, i wait for an hour, no luck, i leave....what is wrong with supercuts? they can't handle a simple reservation system. people plan their day, show some respect."
"i know this is petty of me to say, but how does a stylist not know what a pixie cut is?! this is the second time i've had this particular stylist (i want to say his name is nathan) cut my hair and yes it had been like 3 months since the last time he saw me, but you'd think you'd remember the girl who wanted a pixie cut who had to show what it was via picture what that is because he didn't know! also a small disagreement that i wanted something like the picture i showed him and he kept telling me it was a #1  clipper and i told him i've always had a 3 1/2. sorry, i dont care what it looks like... just do a style like the picture but do what i tell you to do..is that really that hard? ugh. if i didn't like the other ladies who work there i wouldnt come back because of him. i'm requesting one of them next time."
"go to this place only if you don't value your time. i called them in advance today (sunday, november 19) and they told me that the wait line is ~ 1 hour. so they signed me up to come in an hour. when i actually arrived they told me to wait a little and that they would be ""right with me"". after waiting for 15 minutes and not seeing any progress i asked the cashier lady when could i expect to get my service. she answered that there are two more people ahead of me, my call in advance didn't matter at all and that they didn't have sign ups and a adjusted the line in accordance with how many people walked in. as a result i had to leave without service (wasted my time) because i had other things scheduled later on that day."
"the staff in this location is rude to customers.  natalie, the store manager was yelling at customers right in front of me.  this is not a good environment!!"
everything about this place is terrible. rude hairstylist that do not listen a $20 haircut is going to cost me so much to fix! i asked for a trim and i got a choppy uneven mess! all she did was criticize my hair and have nothing but negative comments about everything. i understand having a bad day but at least cut it the way i ask! do not go here!
this salon is really good i like it. they spent a good time on my hair cut :) also the employees are really friendly !
"horrible horrible horrible, and i don't recommend any women to come here for hair cuts! normally, i go to asian salons, but i decided to try a new place because my cuts are quite expensive (usually $50), so i came here because i saw pretty decent reviews, and the price was significantly lower ($19) than what i usually pay. i always get my cut the same. ""please trim the damaged ends, and keep the v-shape."" i never caught her name, but it was an asian lady who cut my hair. her hair was layered, black, and maybe to her mid back or a bit shorter. my hair originally was down to my butt. now, it is at my shoulders!!! i told her to cut my ends, and she literally cut off more than a foot of my hair which took me years to grow out. i have never been more upset after getting a haircut. it's not even shaped in a v like i asked! my hair is just very awkwardly shaped now. worst part is that i wanted to look good for an upcoming banquet, and now i'm going to have to spend a fortune fixing my hair somehow with extensions. very very upset, and now i think i'll just stick to my $50 haircuts once my hair is actually back to it's normal length in a couple of years."
"cheyenne did an amazing style with cut and even more amazing with highlights to dark hair. i would recommend to anyone who needs a professional color, cut and style. a return customer always.......phyllis & jenna"
i have been to this place many a times and i was pretty okay with this place. but this time i had an encounter with an unwelcoming lady. i am not aware of her name but she had blue colored hair. the cut she gave me is terrible. she was cutting hair as if its her first day at job. no manners. no courtesy. absolute rude and unprofessional person and truly a novice. how could supercuts appoint such people? this place used to be good but now its absolutely a place to be avoided. for my recent experience i want to give 0 stars but luckily there is no such option.
"i went in for a trim but decided to live a little and cut my hair. i should've known better. if i could turn back time, i would've turned the car around and peeled it back to my usual places or actually just gotten a trim.the haircut was bad. the type of bad you leave the store with a sinking feeling and a boulder in your lstomach bad. the bad you get when you ate too many chicken nuggets in college at 3 am bad.i got layers on my previously long and shiny hair (rip). well, when i say layers, i meant ""layers"" as in keep the original length but add some volume but putting in layers. holy s this lady (god bless her soul i didn't remember her damn name) cut across the middle of my hair in what looks like a poor replication of an avant garde art piece. it looked like steps.okay, now i have steps. what's next. she also had no idea how to blend in said steps to look natural. nope. she just put down her tools and told me to look at the mirror. uh no. can you please try that again. she cut literally an inch below where my old ombre hair started and my natural color ended. it was now a step and a bar of color. after another try it still looked terrible and i decided to cut my loss and just leave. my hair went in smooth (after many months of hard work and care), long, and healthy looking. my hair now looks frizzy, damaged, and a s---show. she didn't attempt to talk to me at all until the last 3 minutes when she was trying to be subtle and think of convo to get her tip.no.nonononono good thing hair grows back."
i went and a woman was wearing dirty black latex gloves i thought maybe cuz she was at the register but no she sanitized her gloved hands and started running her hands thru my hair. i half wanted to vomit the cut my hair like dora the explorer yup never again. swiper no swiping
"i called at 9:45 on a saturday morning and they scheduled me for 11 that day. i only waited five minutes before my stylist called me over. super efficient. i think my stylist's name was aman (i'm sorry i forgot!) and i adored her. she was incredibly accommodating, friendly, gentle with my brain cavity (much appreciated!), didn't push extras on me but offered them. i was grateful she knew how to hold a conversation but didn't force small talk on me. also importantly, she did a great job with my cut and didn't shame me for the terrible state my bleached mullet was in. considering what she had to work with, she proved her stylist skills.the a-line cut was $24, which included a shampoo. and she dried/ styled it for an additional $15. for someone who pinches pennies, it was a great deal. i'll be back for future hair cuts!"
"come here for choppy cuts :/i wanted a trim for my hair, cut straight--the exact same style i have now, which is straight--cutting off an inch. the lady that cut my hair, who i never asked for the name of since i forgot to, didn't even seem like she knew what she was doing. when i asked for a soft v-line, she said it would look weird and didn't do it; it was my choice and style for my hair, so why does she get to choose what i can do for my hair? she then said she wanted to cut an a-line, and i rejected because i'm not a doll to experiment with--especially with my hair, but i clearly made that mistake by having her cut my hair to begin with.not often did she grab onto locks of my hair to lift an cut, like most professional stylists do. she cut it straight by asking me to tilt my head and bringing the shears, trying to cut my hair straight as if she was tracing a line with scissors on paper. so her technique was poor. she constantly looked at the mirror as she cut my hair, and told me my hair was even when it wasn't (my left side was longer than my right and she didn't fix it).throughout my cut she kept on recommending me different styles i should do to my hair and commenting about it: ""your hair is so dead"", ""you need to re-color it's so uneven"", ""color this higher next time"", etc. thanks, but i'd rather not listen to someone who is a stylist that can barely cut hair.she gave me so many layers when i asked for subtle layers, and i despise it so much. i tie my hair in a half-do because the cut is so bad and i have to wait until my hair grows out for me to get a better, even cut. oh, and she forgot to cut certain parts of my hair so they were my original length; i had to get scissors at so it myself at home.the price for this trim and horrible outcome is still $20.00 for some reason, and it's $20.00 for both men and women, but i say you save your money for elsewhere.the waiting time is not bad at all for a sunday afternoon. we were treated right away without a line waiting prior to us, and the receptionist was very friendly and kind--and professional.even so, i'm not returning and i recommend you to be careful! if you have a bad feeling about your stylist, listen to it or you'll end up with a cut like mine!"
i feel the service there are not worthy the price. men cut in 10 min for 20 while the service is not different.
"i wish i could give a negative rating. the staff is horrible and not courteous at all. i have been to salons where the staff can't speak english but they try to understand customer's needs. she just started the haircut without even trying to understand what kind of cut i wanted. when i explained, she said ""i know my job"". wtf. she also insisted on me getting the hairwash when i didn't want. worst experience. had to walk out without a hair cut."
i've been in other supercuts and this one is much better. it has the same low prices and most importantly the same simple reservation process. people here are very friendly and so far i've been happy with the service.i have to add that i'm probably not a sophisticated customer when it comes to the haircut ;-)
their online check in doesn't work at all unless you do it twice. ended up waiting for 45 minutes at the salon. really horrible site do to online check in. never going here again in my life. they just don't tell you how long the wait is. my recommending this place ever.
"i came here to get a haircut as i have done in the past but the experience is always the same. the only reason why i come here is because it's close to my house and i can walk there on a nice day. but i guess i just need to learn. there was no one there except for 1 hairstylist so i couldn't even pick. when she asked what i wanted i told her i wanted to trim the back of my hair to about here i didn't even get explain anything else and she just cut it right there,  whoops it's a little too late then it was all gone, as we continued she asked if i wanted to shampoo i said yes. when it came time to cutting my hair i was very specific with how i wanted it cut she paid no attention to that. asked if i wanted a blow dry and i said no my goal was to just get out of there and leave. when it came time pay , quoting me a price she quoted me the haircut price and then added five dollars for the shampoo. when i explained to her that the shampoo was included in their haircut for the price stated on the pricing board she said no that's for men only. i said no that's not for men only i've been here many times before that's the correct price ok i'll give you a discount she said. i said no you're not giving me a discount your charge me the price you're supposed to charge me. the staff is consistently inconsistent with the pricing even though there is a pricing board displayed above the register they still quote incorrect prices and try to take money from you it's completely bad business,  some of them don't even know how to cut hair i'm not sure how they got their license it's very disappointing. just because it's a discount type hair salon does it mean you should get discounted and inexperience hairstylist"
"i had a hair cut at supercuts last week. linda was super nice and gave me a great hair cut.i like the way linda cut my hair and she provided very good recommendations to take care of my hair. it was great experience, linda n. was a very nice hair stylist, she took the times to ensure i am happy with  the result. i highly recommend linda for a hair cut at supercuts."
"i just brought my adult niece into super cuts to have her hair washed and styled.  being developmentally disabled, she has a hard time explaining how she wants her hair styled, so i explain to the stylist.  she was assigned to amy.  i explained to amy the style she wanted.  amy then stepped away and spoke to two other stylists, then came back and told me that my niece would have to wait for another stylist.    no explanation as to why she was refusing service.  two other customers were taken before my niece was called.  fortunately the stylist who did provide service was very kind and patient.  i found amy's treatment of us rude, unprofessional, and demeaning."
disapointed. i waisted my time waiting i called a head of time asking if i can come in for a color ombré the assured me yes they will do it and when i got there i waited 30 min to be called once called she pretty much told me no she can't do it. didn't give me any other color options and sent me off not to mention she coulden't even show me the color option booklet!. to me it seemed like she did not want to do the coloring at all! let me just say i have been to a supper cuts and they were able to do ombré smh. disappointed and a waste of my time when i could have gone somewhere else!
"terrible.  avoid stephanie at all costs.  not only did she have an attitude, she proceeded to hit me repeatedly with her clippers.  she high-sided my head after i showed her a photo of a low fade that i requested.  ever seen full metal jacket?  similar experience.  also, they charge 20 dollars for a supercuts, which includes a hot towel wipe.  she hit me with the blow dryer and said ""i think it looks good"".20 dollars will get you a legit haircut at a barber.  don't waste your time."
i've been getting my hair cut here for many years. kathy is great and a pleasure to talk to. she has always given me the feeling that i come to a place where i am welcome and appreciated. kathy manages the place so that it does not feel at all like a chain but a neighborhood establishment.
"i had mixed experience here. last time i got haircut from azam which was pretty good. yesterday some other person (linda) has done my haircut, that turned out to be terrible. i found linda's work to be super quick but very sloppy - she didn't deliver what i wanted and whetever she delivered is of poor quality i.e. it's uneven in so many places."
unorganized place. does not honor their own priority system. they take in regular customers as walk-in. the place looks unhygenic. licenses of such a place should be revoked.
"they should name this location super""bad""cuts. the whole bunch that work here couldnt care less about doing an honest day's work, just pass their time taking breaks all the time and never prioritize online appointments. the place is incredibly dirty and the equipment looks almost unsanitary. they ignore people waiting and i've seen many times people just leave unhappy and angry."
"we've been here for an hour, waiting patiently.  the staff has been ridiculously slow and despite the fact that they had about 10 clients waiting, they still choose to waste time on small talk with departing customers.  then a guy walks in, is greeted immediately, and they take him in front of everyone else.  it wasn't until i complained loudly that i was told that we're next.  what a joke.  i no longer recommend this place because of this inexcusable customer service."
"jacky is an amazing person and she is fun and focused on her job . i went to their salon couple times and she helped me multiple times with an amazing hair color and hair cut. with having 25+years of experience i recommend you all to go to her . once you go ,you will go for ever to her"
"this was the worst day of my life. i arrive in to meet a most unfriendly ** woman who was very rude and smelled bad,she was very aggressive and not gentle. awful experience. greatly disappointed. and then the check overcharged me 65$ not sure she was qualified enough to shear sheep. save yourself from this place. yes she is manager in this place."
"hair is one of those things you shouldn't be lazy about. but when it comes time for a cut, i can always think of more fun ways to spend $60+.hence the time when i came to supercuts. i just needed a quick trim to get off the split ends as well as my roots touched up. somehow that left me $80 poorer, but given the number of terrible salon experiences i've had, i was okay with the price. my roots didn't come out totally perfect (they ended up being about an 8 1/2 instead of a 9 color) but it's not terribly noticable. as for the trim, the lady took off my split ends without ruining my layers, and i was happy enough with the results.would i come back here? ehh, i shouldn't. but i might."
"yolanda gave me a great cut. i asked for trim and taper and she was quick to understand. only negative is they push for the shampoo, massage, the products!! i had a hard time saying no to everything lol. still will come again for the nice quick hair cut."
"i was extremely thrilled w/azita's work! after years of growing out my hair and not taking very good care of it, i finally decided to just chop it off. azita did a great job turning a long rat's nest into a shoulder-length, stylish cut. i showed her a picture of what i was looking for and she took it from there (while still keeping me informed of what she was doing to my head)! she will definitely be the one to maintain it from here on out!(only reason i'm not giving this 5 stars is because the price was a little bit much... $44 for a cut, blow dry and style.  i was willing to pay it, given the state of my hair and how drastic the change was, but it's a bracing difference from the $19 trims/cuts i'm used to! azita is worth the price, but i don't know if i'd feel comfortable with it for any other stylist.)"
"this place sucks, specially on the weekends. they have hired people who have other jobs during the weekdays & really don't know how to give a hair cut. the place had edgy barbers. just weekends is a horrible place . i wish i could give them -5 stars."
"this was the worst service that i have received from a supercuts center. the stylist has had no interest in the cut. therefore, the cut has an absolute lack of basic quality. absolutely disappointed about this place."
"the service at this location is pretty bad across the board. from the time you enter, to the end of the haircut the service just sucks. no one acknowledges you on entry. app check-in and wait times mean nothing. a 0 minute wait time is more like 20 minutes. people checking in person get in ahead of your app check-ins (done 15 minutes earlier). prices are higher than other supercuts. haircuts are standard. won't be visiting again. really needs franchise management to take a look."
"this is the absolute worst place to get a haircut, i mean honestly, the only thing u can do there is purchase one of the resold branded hair-care products. and also, the staff there is deaf, and does not listen, for i just had a haircut where i had asked my barber to give me three on all sides and cut around half of the hair on the top. however, i exited the store with hair that matched a chinese monk, and now, bald with a cleanly shaved head, i beg u to not end up the position i am in, and choose a place whose staff listens to you."
"first time i've cut my hair in years at another place other than my aunts salon, didn't really know what to do with my hair, but jenny was very nice and helped me throughout the whole thing, i haven't loved my hair in a long time, i totally recommend you get ur haircut with jenny! great costumer service and haircut! :)"
"turns out kardelia does not work here anymore. she was just perfect for short hair cuts.today i went in just despite finding out kardelia no longer works there, thinking to myself... how badly can someone screw up a hair cut and then i found out. i should have figured out when she started and stopped her because it did seem like she had no clue. i would have really appreciated if she was honest and just said she has no experience.ladies should skip this place if you have short hair!"
not everyone here knows how to cut.. not a place what i was looking for...too bad for people who have curly hair.. they will make you cartoon character..
"just because they are cutting kid's hair, they feel they don't really have to pay attention. i took my daughter today for hair cut. lady who gave her hair cut was very sleepy probably. she just plainly ran her scissor in a straight line still from the back,  right side looks shorter than left. hate this place and never coming back. $16+ $2 tip, not worth it at all! i went there just because i went to target for shopping and regret my bad decision ever. my 8 yr old was sad to see her hair when it dried up. please don't go there an don't take your kids either. there are other better salons where stylists are hard working, pay attention to details and not sleepy!!"
"from what i've noticed from this place, my haircut is always a hit or a miss depending on who is cutting it. they always have different people cutting at different times of the day and some people know how to actually cut the hair and others simply just suck. it's hard to give a good gauge as to how things are. however, the one thing that i absolutely dislike about this place is the increase in prices. i've been coming to this place for years now and i remember when i first came, it was about $15. now, it's $20 for a frickin haircut. $20 is way too excessive. therefore, i'll probably not go there anymore. side note: i'm a guy so idk how the haircuts are for women."
"i was unable to wash and dry my own hair due to a surgery.  nancy was very gentle, listened to my concerns and needs and delivered better results than any highend salon i have used in the past.  my husband has been getting his hair cut here for years and honestly, it's a bargain."
"don't go to this place . they have their own ""friends"" jump the line. super rude people . worst place in america."
"i have been coming here for many years. i get consistently good work from pretty much anyone i get to cut my hair and i think that they are very reasonably priced.  they make good suggestions for your hair style when asked and they also give you good advise on how to take care of your hair afterwards.  this feels like a very neighborly place to me where the employees carr about people and they all try hard to give good service.  wait times can vary but you can leave your name and go shop nearby for a while and come back later. kardelia runs a good team and if you want some good work done for a very decent price, this is a great place to come."
"i am a regular customer at this location in the heart of cupertino, but tonight i've got the worst service ever and the highest price quoted ever to color the roots only ($65.00)!!! from the start i was hinted that i need to go to professional salon and that my color will not turn out right. then i needed to make a decision about the color to blend in. at that point all i had left is just to leave.:(("
"i went for a haircut and supercolor. i dont know the person who did my coloring. it was the worst coloring i ever had. i came back home and realized this. the color was all over my skin ( under both ears, on the forehead and all over the back on the neck). she has not bothered to apply vaseline before starting. worst job ever."
i just heard kardelia no longer works there. is this true?? does anyone know where she went? who is going to cut my hair from now?
"i don't want to write the name of the stylist here, but the work she did on my husband's hair is just horrible. he went for a trim and she trimmed his hair and also thinned them. he is practically bald now.never ever go here.."
"go ask for azita! !very  good lady  ,,good in cut, ,color  but also fix your color  as well  when  you don't like! !"
"went there as i needed a haircut and was exploring places where i can get a reasonable haircut.  the initial welcome was good, i entered my details in the computer and was asked to wait for 15 min.when my turn came. ...i explained as how i need my haircut to be done but very soon i found that the actual haircut was totally different as i explained. she made my head looks as a rounded watermilon.  worst haircut i ever had. now i need to wait till my hair grows big and go for a good haircut place.note: if someone going there...please make sure u instruct them every minute so that u get a haircut as u wanted."
"daughters hair all broke off from a keratin treatment and then i saw her brush it out and pulled it and brushed it so hard. it was awful. i had to stand up. a few times in the beginning i was just going to walk straight out because of the vibe and the haughtiness the young asian beautician displayed but i thought maybe it will be ok. always go with your instinct. 30% of her hair is now gone and broken off all on top so it looks like it sticks up. so sad. she had luxurious hair and now it's thin. :( the 1st time an older woman did it and did a great job. this time, won't be back."
"kudos to brianna. she does such an awesome job. she cuts all the boys hair, and my mans. she is attentive and always very communicative with us on styling. i can say she is really good with ethnic hair, because my boys hair is very coarse and has a tendency to stand straight up, but she has done a great job with styling in the latest fashion trend. we have been going here and will continue to show her our loyalty."
i'm not one to give bad reviews but i think this was the worst place i've ever gone to get a haircut. i came in pretty positive trusting the people there with giving a decent haircut but i really over estimated them. the end result was terrible. i hate my hair now. i told the lady clear instructions on what i wanted and what my usual hairstyle was. she went completely opposite of what i wanted. so terrible. so ugly. i will never go here again. i definitely won't be recommending this place to anyone. $20 for a shitty ass haircut. goodbye.
i love it. last time i went to get my hair cut the lady cut off way to much (i just wanted a trim)here i was a little nervous because the lady didn't speak good english.  but me and my bf got our hair cut and they turned out great. they didn't cut to much off the lines on mine look nice. if you come here just make sure you explain everything and they understand i'm sure you'll leave happy.
"first off, they tell me thirty minutes wait until the next haircut, that's fine, an hour and 15 passes. secondly, my hair dresser, hien, was terrible. first off, she was rude and super abrupt. i told her i wanted a disconnected undercut but to fade from a 2 to a 3. say she understands. when she starts cutting, the haircut feels weird, so i ask to look, it looks terrible. she says she's not done. i let her do what she wants. proceeds to use the razor and constantly bumps my head with it while cutting. i just get it over with. once she gets to the fade, she tells me that the hair is weird and that she will have to fade it, that's what i wanted in the first place. in the end, i just want to be out from what terrible service i have received. i check my own hair, it looks terrible. while there is apparent that there was a change in razor sizes from two to three, its not faded at all. the top back of my hair is basically a mushroom cap. since i had asked to not touch the front, the front looks fine. overall, a terrible job and won't be coming back. not worth $20."
"ladies steer clear of this salon. it seems as though they specialize in men's haircuts. i should have known better to come here when i noticed there were only male customers. i came here to get a little trim, preparing for professional photos that are being taken at my new job in a few days. i told the stylist i wanted a trim and to keep the style, including my bangs. i showed her a photo of how i wanted my bangs. she cut way too much to where i feel like i hardly have any hair left. she tried to blend my bangs with the hair in front, like taper it. it doesn't blend at all. she just cut way too much. when blending it like that it shouldn't be super noticeable. also, i asked that she only trim my bangs and to have them at eyebrow length. i already had them, they were just a little too long. she started snipping away and then stepped back to look at them, when i saw in the mirror what she had done i wanted to run out right then. i told her they were uneven. she kept trying to fix them and i finally had to stop her. they look terrible and they're too short to pin back.  i feel so embarrassed and self conscious. it took everything in me to hold back the tears. on top of it all i have to have my photos taken at work soon with this hair. i will never visit a supercuts again."
"i just found out that my stylist of many years, song, retired. she had consistently given me the best haircut and was someone i looked forward to visiting. i'll miss you song! congratulations on your retirement... you deserve the best!"
"i had a great first impression.i've never been to a supercuts before and i didn't know what to expect. i decided to go early in the morning to avoid waiting too long, it was a good call. the lady who cut my hair was very friendly and the wash was amazing! i definitely want to come back, just to get my hair washed. and of course she did a great job cutting my hair. i was very satisfied with the place and the service, this will now be my go to place."
"i won't complain about the staff as a person, super friendly.  but my goodness, my stylist shouldn't cut hairs..... it was uneven and left a square tail on the end of my hair."
"got a quick haircut here and she did a great job. quick and clean, no drama or hatred. somewhat expensive for men's haircut but recommend this place. my hair stylist i think name dung is pretty looking too."
i always get the same lady i don't remember her name but she is asian and has short hair. it's always a nice convo along with a nice hair cut. she's so friendly. i like this location even though i live downtown and there are closer ones. they know what they're doing here. make an app because they get really busy!
"i've been going to atelier in santana row, but the stylists there charge $60 + for the cut/styling that are not that great nor complimentary to my look (casual professional).  so i was looking for a new hair salon to get my shoulder length hair trimmed and slightly textured (but not too seared) at the bottom so that it would curl in when i style and not bulk out.  today, i got exactly that when i came to supercuts that was close to where i was shopping things.  my stylist kathy was very pleasant, attentive, and professional about cutting my hair.  she had a pleasant manner in conversing with me while she cut and styled my hair.  she also dried and styled my hair without charging any extra.  for $17 + tip (she really deserved it too), i walked out looking a lot better than i did a few months ago after a cut at atelier, and much happier and more satisfied with the customer service.  i will go back to this supercuts to have kathy do my hair again."
"supercuts are hit and miss in general, so it takes a fantastic stylist to get me to go back time after time.  haylee is consistently nailing it with her haircuts!  she takes her time and does it right.  not to mention she is always on a pleasant mood and genuinely wants to you enjoy your haircut.  wait times can be rough at this location, so be sure to call ahead to check in on their app."
went in for cut and colorstylist was super nice meticulous and did an extraordinary job !
"went and got a hair cut from then a week ago, got a hair that were not even so went back 5 days later asking them to fix and they but charging me full price of the hair. should they fixing it for free, you would think so right but not. end customer not happy with hair then charge again to fix it."
"out of all the salons/barbershops i've been to, this is the worst. it took the staff an hour and 15 minutes to get through 3 customers. so, i'm waiting for awhile now, and one of the employees comes in and clocks on, and she clearly sees people waiting for their turn. however, she just ignores us and chats with the other employees for a good 30 minutes. finally, she decides to work and she's decides to cut my hair. great, i can get my goods done. i ask her for simple number 1 fade comb over. instead she barely touches the top of my hair, and gives me buzz cut on my sides. i was clearly dissatisfied with her work, and when she notices, she gives me attitude and says i should've downloaded the app and made a reservation. like cmon dude, i'm kind enough to not complain about the $20 shit haircut, but you tell me i should've known better? honestly never coming back to this place. overall, this place is overpriced for a haircut, you'd be better off growing out your hair than coming here."
"do not get your hair cut by song. you tell her to cut it one way and she cuts it however she feels like cutting it. i look like an idiot. she cut my hair like she hated my whole family. i'd rather shave my head with a dull rock than walk around with this hair cut she gave me. i can't believe how bad my haircut is. i could of give my friends new born baby two samurai swords and she probably could of cut it better than song. if you do plan on going to song for a hair cut, i'd recommend setting your hair on fire and putting it out really fast. it would save you 17 dollars."
"asked how long was the wait said 15 min which was not bad, i told the lady i'll back back in 10min she said ok. i came back saw she was about to be done, but she went on break her name is liz. i saw another lady was about to be done with another customer so i waited another five minute found out she was off. as i was waiting all this time only customer left no one said anything. from 15min i had to wait 30min just to fine out after i went up and ask what was going on to wait another 15min. lady she said sorry i'm the only one. 45 min to get a hair cut at supercuts. all they had to do was say from the beginning or anytime that it will be 45 min wait. worst service ever.."
"nvm there's red in my hair, doesn't look bad. and whenever i wash my hair, my fingernails are filled with black dyed skin flakes... not sure if i've seen it like this before since i dyed hair multiple times and it never came out flakey. butttt it's okay my trim was still nice, will come back for the cuts"
"wanted to write a quick review. walked in and was seen within 15 minutes, chin did my hair, he was kind and very welcoming! we talked for a while as he cut my hair and i had full trust in him cutting my hair! i've had the same girl cut and color my hair for 5 years now, so the fact that he made me feel comfortable is great.!bottom line he's been with the company for 10 years and did a great job with my hair.! i will return to see him again.!"
"super arrogant and rude! the person who did the haircut on my wife! i asked if she could blow-dry and in some way show  the haircut style, she answered rudely saying it was not my hair,  & it only mattered if my wife liked it. when i said to remove us from their system she said it didn't matter to her, that for every bad client that leaves she gets three good ones. liz is her name she said, & that she didn't care about the bad reviews, we've been customers since this location opened, sadly this was a very bad experience and won't be back, this person doesn't know how to treat people"
"good place for quick and clean haircut. my man dj will cut your hair fast and clean, and with not mistakes.i hate taking forever getting a haircut. that's why i always ask for dj. clean, fresh, and always perfect!"
the waiting times are ridiculous. i came in at 4:00 waited until 4:42 just to be cut my 3 because other people called
"if you're a guy with pretty straightforward hair whether old or young, these people can probably give you a decent cut.  i know a couple of guys that go here all the time and they look like normal humans when they emerge. or if you are a child with perfectly straight hair and you're asking them to cut a straight line across the back, they might do an ok job.however- if you are a female do not do it.  you will regret it.  i gave these people three chances over a two year period with my perfectly normal straight hair.  my hair is absolutely nothing difficult, and all three times they truly butchered it.  this last time was the worst.  i can honestly say it looks like an angry cat gnawed and chewed at my hair!!  no joke.  she even blow dried it for thirty minutes, and kept adding spray and gel over and over so that when i looked in the mirror it looked ok.  as soon as i got in the car and moved my head i saw that she was using the ten pounds of gel and blow dryer to shape my hair, almost like it's play doh, into looking normal.  not only that but she used the shearing scissors and completely, and i mean completely ruined my hair - in fact i cannot even get it fixed because it's so uneven that i have to wait for it to grow for a few months.  she also somehow charged me 60.00 for this cut.  go to his and hers hair bar across the street.  they won't upsell, give you a free drink and do a beautiful job on your hair."
"i've been going to supercuts having beatriz cut and/or color my hair for 1 year now (like 1-2x a month haha) :) so wanted to give an updated review. i refuse to go anywhere else!!! it's more affordable than the top notch salons and beatriz does such an amazing job, i feel like i got top notch service!!! i've lived in cali for 8 years and couldn't find anyone i was satisfied with until now! she always listens to what i want and gets it right every time and with a very friendly and professional attitude. i am always in and out quicker than i have ever been anywhere else so it's not that time consuming which is great because setting at a salon 3-4 hours is tiring."
"beatriz always cuts my hair, shes amazing, go to beatriz you will not be disappointed!!!!"
they always do great cuts for us and are always friendly. we like a special cut for my son and they always do it right. we are happy going there.
"i made an appointment to get my haircut at 4pm yesterday. i decided to give them a try since i was in the area. i got there around 3:50pm. they greeted me and asked me to sit and wait. within the next 10 mins, 2 more people came. finally, one of the lady finished the person she was working on and called a white man up. knowing i had made an appointment and he was a walkin. she looked at her coworker and spoke in vietnamese saying can someone take me cause she took the white guy since she didnt want him to wait...it went back and forth between her and the 2 coworkers...it was 4:15 by now..i got annoyed and spoke to them in both english and vietnamese (shocking them that im viet) how unprofessional they are. i felt had i been white, i may have actually got my appointment the time i made it for. i find it very unprofessional of people to speak in their native language while having clients that don't understand what they are saying. all in all, id save my money and time and find anther place.sent from my iphone"
i received the most hideous hair cut by a women who obviously couldn't understand english.  i asked for a trim (2 inches)  this woman cut 5 to 6 inches off.  when i told her she didn't understand what it was i wanted she said ih well 18.95.  i was blown away by her attitude and by the haircut i received.  her station is the first one on the right.  don't get your hair cut by her she is totally unprofessional and doesn't know how to cut hair!
call ahead and good luck trying to get your scheduled time. not sure why they tell you a time.
"i not to picky about my hair; most times i wear a ball cap and keep my hair pretty short, but the hack job i got today is unbelievable.  when i was 4 years old and gave myself a haircut i probably did a better job.  there are random long patches and short patches along the sides of my head that were obvious once i got home and looked closely in the mirror. i'm not being picky either the differences in hair lenth are greater than half an inch; and up to an inch in some placesi not sure of her name but if a younger spanish lady with tattoos tries cutting your hair, run."
"do not go to supercuts to get highlights or foil lightening! i got a melt done back in may at a great salon and went to supercuts to try and get it touched up for a better price. when i told her what i got done and exactly how it was done at my previous salon, she said she could do it and started to apply the bleach. when she rinsed it out i was greeted with the most hideous edges i've ever seen. she took no time to blend my highlighted hair in with my natural hair. i asked if she could dye the roots to fade the highlights better and initially she said no, but then changed her mind when she saw how unhappy i was with my hair. when she was finishing up the dye, she explained to me how supercuts couldn't do what i wanted with my hair at this location. i would have been okay if i couldn't have gotten what i wanted done if i would have been informed of it before she started bleaching my hair. she at least tried to make it right with dying it but i'll be making an appointment with my regular salon to get it fixed anyway because it's still not exactly what i wanted and when the dye washes out my roots will look hideous. in addition, a different lady gave me a trim and asked if i wanted 2 inches off. i said no and i wanted 1/2 inch off only (showed her with my fingers too). she completely disregarded that and cut off 2 inches anyway. overall, mediocre skills and terrible communication. pictures are attached of the highlights before and after the dye was added. i'd be embarrassed to call myself a hair stylist if i was giving that kind of service to others."
i love this branch. been coming here for over a decade. the ladies are kind and do always do a great job. always book appointment via telephone or website as they get very busy. be patient they are worth it.
"you really get what you pay for. haircuts here are cheaper & i think are a greater option for men than it is for women. i do not remember the person who cut my hair but my experience here was just alright. i always get lured into getting cheap haircuts & then afterward regret that i did because the experience just feels very unenjoyable. you don't get your hair washed or shampooed, no styling & the technique in their cuts seem to emphasize timeliness rather than quality. i've never had my hair colored here but i'd honestly be scared to."
"i've been going here for 7 years, but never again! i've made appts. in the past and had to wait a little bit while they finished up the prior customer, but today was different. i made a phone appt. with helen and got there on time to find that she had just taken a young kid (by the looks of it, a few mins earlier). i was acknowledged by her when i walked in and then made to wait for 25mins(!), while she spent an exorbitant amount of time trimming up his buzz cut and washing his hair. nothing else was ever said by anyone there with regards to my having to wait so long. i finally left without saying a word.to top it off, even though i have been going to helen for much of this time, my haircuts have been inconsistent at best. i go as a matter on convenience, but i really have to pay attention to make sure i get a decent haircut.don't waste your time or money at this location."
great cuts from all the crew at this place.  no rush service and attention to detail. bummed that vi (vee) has moved on. she gave me the best cut i have ever had.  hopefully her departure is temporary.
"i had the worst service here. i came in just to get my hair washed because i broke my arm pretty badly. seemed simple enough, but i was very wrong. after waiting 40 minutes, the woman finally took me to the back, i told her i just wanted my hair washed and braided because of my arm and she said she didn't know how to braid. she then went to take my hair out of the pony tail, she couldn't and i told her to just cut the hair tie because it wasn't worth it and she cut my hair instead of the tie. she told me that new management meant that she could only do everything in 5 minutes and that i should get a keratin treatment instead. after washing my hair, she brought me to the chair and started brushing my hair instead of combing it. just the top layer was brushed and she went to put it in a pony tail and i said i wanted it higher and felt my hair and it was still so tangled. after all that, i had to do comb my hair one handed and finished it at home. i left so upset. would not recommend this place to anyone."
"i got my hair cut by vee. she did a great job, was very polite, and took her time. was very satisfied by her attention to detail and making sure i was completely happy with my cut. will definately come back to get my hair cut from her."
i received the worst hair cut in my life by a woman who does not understand english and does not know what she was doing i have asked for 4 and she cut too short and they keep laughing with each other when i said that this is not right and worst part is i had to pay $18 for for such ugly hair cut they do. i could have given zero if yelp allowed me. save your money and hair by going to some other place
"horrible service. let's others cut in line, even after having booked online. will not be returning again. thankfully another supercuts has just opened up close by."
decided to try supercuts one more time. made an appointment ahead of time. came to the location and i was promptly greeted by staff. my stylist was friendly and very detailed in her work. she made sure i got what i asked for and i appreciate the time she took to ensure my hair was cut properly. i will be coming back to this location again.
"the only reason i am leaving a review is because of the new stylist katlyn. katlyn started about 6 weeks ago and i just happen to end up with her one day when i dropped in for a quick haircut. the last 3 haircuts have been outstanding! she listens and asks questions in an effort to get your haircut right. i reccomend the tea tree service as well with her. let's be honest, supercuts in general is a crapshoot for a good haircut. that said, when you find someone good it's a bonus."
"be prepared to wait for quite some time almost all days of the week. on weekend the wait time is really high. this supercuts is located in the rivermark plaza near the safeway. i have been a couple of times here. this seems to be quite a busy location and the wait time is typically around 20-30 minutes. also i am quite disappointed with the final result of my haircut. i have tried two different stylists on two different occasions and on both the occasions the haircut length was way shorted than i instructed/asked for. and unlike a bad experience in a restaurant, you can't get your hair back (compare with sending your food back). so maybe from next time i will try a different place. i waited for two visits before posting this so that the review doesn't look like a knee-jerk reaction from a singular visit."
i went to get my hair done here because caitlin started working here.  she's amazing and awesome at what she does.  she has over 25 years experience and is always updated to the current fashion.  i'll follow her wherever she works.  she listens to what type of haircut you want and trust me whatever it is you'll be very happy with it.  thanks again caitlin!! see you soon.  don't forget ask for caitlin!  you will thank me!!
"this was a horrible experience. the stylist did a very bad job of trimming my hair. she trimmed more than what i had asked for.  i wasn't even sure she was understanding what i'm saying since she just kept nodding her head. after the trimming, she didn't even bother to blow the strands of hair from my face. i had to ask her to do it later which caused all the strands to fall on my shirt! the old staff was nowhere to be found. looks like all the good staff has moved to better locations. i would be never going to this place anymore."
"i will not recommend this store to anyone.i went there today for haircut. i showed them a picture for reference (those employees somehow don't understand english). woman who was cutting my hair was very rude. i asked her why she is talking rudely and she said it's a bad day for her (why talk rudely then).she cut my hair very short than i asked for and when i questioned her about that, she said because she accidently cut some hair short and covered it cutting remaining hair short (ridiculous).also, she was cutting hair so harshly that once or twice her scissor hurt my head.plz don't go to this store. they'll ruin your hair.edit: i went home and checked backside of my head. it was looking messy. i had to trim it by myself to make it look better. i've attached photo of how it looked post haircut."
"where is cody? inquiring minds need to know. i liked the other guy's (dane?) work also. unfortunately i put my kids name on the list for him and when my family arrived he was working on another client and took like 40 mins to complete that. we waited and ended up having one kid go to another stylist and the other went to him. i was willing to give him another chance because i witnessed his work on several occasions and it was very good, and he apologized. however, he is no longer there either. i went to the super cuts on holger partially because i was hoping to find them lol. no such luck. without cody this is just a dusty, outdated location with bad parking. i will just go to the other location to get my little kids a decent haircut until i find something else."
"there must have been an ownership change at this location.  since they got rid of all the old stylist and brought in new people.  i've been coming here for the past 7 years and getting my hair cut by cody.  however, his no longer there as are the other familiar faces that i used to see.  everybody there is all new.  based on the cut i received, they must have all just graduated from supercuts training program with zero experience.    i would never go back to this supercuts.  for the past 7 years, the days that cody worked (tues to sat), there were always a wait with waiting area full, now, no matter what time you go by, they are empty.  no wait what so ever.  that tells you something, they are loosing business left and right from people like me.  new management at this location deserves to loose all of their old customers when they discharged all of their experienced stylist."
"feel compelled to leave a 1 star review because i had the absolute worst experience. i wanted to trim my split ends as my hair is growing long. the lady didn't seem to understand my 'please don't cut it too short, keep the original shape', and forced 'a style' on me. she chopped off so much hair that at one point i literally asked her to stop cutting my hair. her style turned out to be hideous, lucky me that i put my hair up in a bun most of the time. i am never going back to supercuts. this is a great place for guys - a lot of my guy friends go there frequently and their hair come out fine. just not for gals. especially not if your hair is long."
first of all i give one star because i just lost two of my best stylist. i came in today and find out that two of my best stylist are no longer working at this location. i have been going to kathy and cody bui for sometime now. every time i come in to town i always stop by to either see kat or cody they are excellent with there craft. i also wonder why they stay so long at this location and not start something on there own but they always say they care about the people they work with . i just want to thank them for all those wonderful haircuts sorry supercuts i will never come back to this location again.
"this place is hard to beat for fast, cheap, and decent haircuts and beard trims. is this going to be the most amazing spa experience of your life? nope? best haircut ever? not likely. but for a decent, affordable cut this place is good. the stylists are competent and friendly."
"i went to this place because it is near where i visit my parents.  christine cut my hair and was an expert. i have long hair and needed it cut with a bit of a layer, and she not only did an excellent job but was also very pleasant. i have to give her thumbs up, since she really deserves it.  thank you, christine!"
"the lady cut me up and didn't want to let me see the back of my neck the two times she had me look back at it , i don't understand why she couldn't just be honest with me and i would understand her but the fact that she gripped on to my shirt twice to cover it is not okay and i understand she messed up but that's more messed up of me to get talked into buying their product and getting cut up."
was referred by a friend to go here and get an appointment with cody. really friendly guy. he knew what i wanted before telling him and i loved the result. will definitely go back.
"i have been coming here for years. still great, still affordable. worth the wait. thank you for your superb customer service kathy! love my a-line bob."
"another crappy experience- called yesterday and the lady told me that my stylist will be tomorrow and i can call tomorrow to set up an appointment. i called today and i was told that they are not taking appointments anymore because they are booked, but i can still come in and wait in line...."
great place for a haircut. cody gave me a much needed wonderful haircut and after care recommendations. thanks cody!
"i had my haircut done by cody and in all my years of having my hair done at salons (even high-end), this has been by far my best.  cody didn't make me feel like i was just another customer at supercuts and he was conscious about the concerns i had with my hair to the point that i left with tears of happiness!  my experience was great and i will definitely be coming back to cody. -lucy"
being going to this place for few months. cody is the  best at what he does. he takes so much care and everytime i visit here he gives me a new look. i highly recommend this place.
"i will definitely be back. everyone who works there has tons of regular customers. i can see why. i popped in for a haircut before the lunch rush, and it's one of the best, most reasonably priced haircuts i've ever had, and i used to work in the hair products business. if you come in knowing what you want, and you communicate that to their stylists, you'll be happy."
"been going to kathy for many years...she is awesome...she knows how to cut hair perfectly..ask for her, you won't be disappointed.great customer service, reasonable prices, can be a bit busy sometimes, but i'd rather wait and have my hair done the way i want, then to go somewhere quickly and be disappointed. the stylist that work there are very friendly...everyone seems happy to be there.ask for kathy!"
