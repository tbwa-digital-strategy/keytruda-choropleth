"i know there are plenty of other restaurants that probably have better wings but i just can't get over their asian zing sauce - its soooo good. i usually order for pick up but i've dined in as well and have always had good experiences. service is quick and staff is friendly. i always get the asian zing and lemon pepper wings with a basket of wedges, all delicious and satisfying. one thing that could improve is their cocktails which aren't that great. they have tons of tvs and some arcade games to kill time while you wait for your order. i also recently became a member of their 'blazin rewards' loyalty program and its pretty cool as you get free food every so points. i think it makes for a cool spot to hang out with friends or watch sporting games."
"you wonder how a chain restaurant specializing in fried chicken wings could only have two stars--the answer is, ""if the place is staffed by bronxites who really couldn't give a f*** less."" you know it's coming when it's late on a friday.the service is begrudging at best, but the only reason you even get your food is out of spite. your wings have likely spent about 5 minutes dying under a heat lamp turned up halfway to warm, and maybe you'll get a clean set of silverware to enjoy apps that come out after you're halfway through entrees...who knows? did you want silverware? here's a dirty fork crammed into your food, and use your tiny beer napkin to wipe your face since you didn't get the courtesy of a clean knife and are now cramming chunks of saucy, lukewarm chicken into your gullet. seriously, eff these people who punish you for their self-loathing."
"i went here thinking my experience would of been worst, but it was just ok. from the service to the food, drink included, everthing was just ok. it was a bit  overwhelming at first because the place is hugh, and you would think they would be full, but it wasnt alot of people there at all for such a hugh place. i find it to be alot of waisted space. they have a lil area where you can play games, kind of like applebees and dave and busters made a baby. anyway i prefer applebees anyday. i think there wings are better. for a place to be called buffalo wild wings, thier wings didnt wild me at all. also the boneless wings i didnt even finish, (not good). anyway i cant say i would never return (maybe)f.y.i. they have valet parking."
"i have been to this buffalo wild wings before and have gotten takeout a whole bunch of times. i always wondered why people were leaving negative reviews, and now i know why. lol.my boyfriend and i arrived around 6 pm and the place was nearly empty. the hostess greeted us and asked us if we wanted one of the high tables on the wall or the center tables. when i said that we wanted a booth, she looked bothered. why ask if you are not going to going to accommodate paying customers? i do not understand why this would be a problem if the place was nearly empty.you might be wondering if that alone got them their one star... nope! the food was even more disappointing. our waitress was a mess! we had to repeat the order more than once... and she still got it wrong. we ordered a medium boneless wings, with sauces on the side. the waitress brought them with the sauces on them. we sent them back, and the next order came out in like two minutes. they were extremely hot. i already knew they were fried extremely fast since they were raw! i was served raw pink chicken! we started breaking some of them to check the rest of them and they were all wet and slimey inside! we called the manager over, and he took them to the back. when he came back, he told us that some of the wings must of stayed on the surface and did not fry correctly... whattt!?"
horrible service all around ghetto slow and the food was horrible will never ever walk in this place again
i went here for dinner with my coworkers and my bosses. servers were very kind and respectful and friendly. they took our orders but the food arrived pretty late. overall great food and staff! one star taken out for service.
"learned my lesson so now we only pay in cash here. food was good, service was so slooooooooooooow. and it's fairly empty in here."
"i've been to other buffalo wild wings before, and have had pleasant experiences. however, here, the service was subpar. our waitress was lazy and she disappeared for 20 minute intervals. overall they seemed short staffed and i was very dissatisfied with the service here."
all i have to say is this place has terrible service. i was here 40 minutes with a friend and they got out order wrong twice. we ended up leaving when they wanted to correct the order again. the place wasn't even packed! i will not be returning to this location.
"came to this place this sunday afternoon with a friend, the parking area is really tight so we parked in the streets. i do know they have a second floor parking which i'm against of how you have to pay to park. going inside i was really disappointed with how dirty the double doors were and the floors looked like it hasn't been mopped or sweeped in months. their was garbage on the stairs and the hand rails were super dirty. that's really gross if you try to bring family a date or even have an event here. ounce your upstairs no one at the front desk we waited about 5 minutes! the girl that came to the front desk asked us were we wanted to sit the tables or the bar we picked the bar. we sat and in about 5 minutes we decided what we were going to eat. the girls behind the counter were just in one corner talking and some in their phones. after waiting 20 minutes for someone to ask us what we were going to order i had to flag down a worker to attend us. the vibe was right since we was watching a football game in the big flat screen, the beer choices were great and the food was delicious. other than that i will try another spot i wont come to this place anymore it's a waste of time."
"worst location.  worst service. tried to have a draft party here. and they never set up my party even though i called a head of time.  nothing was on record.  my name, my reservation, my requests for a kit and access to an outlet.  my server took out her micro aggressions on us and never came to the table in proper intervals to take our orders.  we ended up walking over to the bar to get drinks.  our food orders were incorrect and came out at weird times.  it was the worst trip there i've ever experienced with my husband and friends.  we have not been back since. this was august 2017."
"i'm giving this place 5 stars because of their waiter ralph who took good care of us last night and earned his tips.  but my first experience in this buffalo wild wing was 3 months ago, the waiter was ok and when we were done, we had wanted to get some shots at the bar and when we asked for it, the bartender told us to wait with a bitchy face and turned around and never bothered to assist us, so we went to a local bar on bailey ave, thanks a lot. also, the location from harlem was terrible too, from the waiter to the manager..  please keep ralph content and don't lose this good worker"
"i really don't care how my food turns out when my bf comes back with it. i called this place numerous times in 15 minutes. first time she put me on hold for 5 minutes. so i hung up. the other ten minutes she didn't answer the phone at all. my boyfriend is waiting there now for a pickup after 30 minutes from ordering only 9 wings. he told me while he's waiting the worker is standing there, talking and ignoring the phone ringing. fucking terrible customer service, i can't imagine what service is like eating there. shut this location down already. it sucks! hence all the terrible reviews."
"my mother in law and wife were pre gaming here while they waited for me to get out of work. they were being served by shaffon at the bar,  and from what they told me, she's a great bartender. now, i've been bartending for over 15 years so i'm like ""whatever"". after i ordered my first drink with shaffon, i knew i was going to have a good time. she's prompt and attentive. a fun girl to be around. she was so fun that i eventually decided to stay for dinner. she made my mother in law (the birthday girl) feel great and maintained a fun environment. wings are on point but i wouldn't expect anything else. we ordered the burgers and they were servedat the right temperature and tasted great. i don't usually eat french fries but these tasted good. overall  my step mother (who's birthday it was) had an amazing time (thanks to shaffon) and we thank buffalo wild wings  (and shaffon) for a great time."
"if i could give this place 0 stars, i would. i'm writing this review as i'm sitting in the restaurant as we speak. that's how bad the service is. arrived at 11, ordered and my food didn't arrive until 11:40. to make it even worst, my full order didn't even arrive at that time. stay away from this place!!!!! i wish i would have!!"
"i came in at 10:22pm.  there was no one at the counter.  i had to lean over the counter and yell out "" is anybody working here"".  i saw 2 young spanish girls talking to each other while sitting on some boxes in the back.  the cashier ""leilani"" did not get up right away nor did she apologize.instead she responded with an attitude when i had questions about how hot the sauce was.  then she went back to hiding in the back leaving the front unattended.  people came in and were waiting for someone to come.  the phone kept ringing and no one was answering it.  i never seen a restaurant so unprofessional."
"place seems understaffed at 10 pm at less than 50 percent capacity for dine in, with staff on cell phones and chit chatting and one tired looking waitress hustling all over the floor by herself. i ordered for a 10:10 pickup for wings at 9:40 and they didn't start cooking them until i got there, after waiting for five minutes for someone to start manning the pickup desk.  then they got the order wrong and had to do it again. i was ready to ask for a refund at 10:40 pm which is about the same amount of time it would take to order wings for delivery from somewhere else (for a lot less money than these guys charge). at that point, the manager stepped in and graciously threw in 10 extra wings on my order. when i got home i discovered - wrong order. the wings taste good. the service is rough. i am so sorry i wing-cheated on you, bronx ale house - please forgive me and take me back."
"so i normally go to the buffalo wild wings in the palisades and it is my favorite, but i must say i was disappointed in this location. i ordered the lunch option and my order was for boneless wings and i received traditional. i then ordered the side salad with the wings and the lettuce was brown ! definitely will not be attending this location ever again"
"terrible. waited 50 minutes for our food and people who got there after us had finished eating and were ready to pay. left without eating and got a simple ""sorry we'll pay for the drinks"" never going back to this location."
"favorite place for lemon pepper wings, beer and a chilled time!!! my son loves it too! kid friendly !! try their cheddar burger with chunks of cheeseomg  and their potato wedges"
"i came here last night for the boneless thursday deal with my friend-- which is great by the way (60 cents per wing)! we waited around 15 minutes to get seated as it was pretty busy.one thing that stood out though was that i felt extremely welcomed by our waitress (i didn't get her name), but her smile and attitude allowed us to comfortably order our food and try new things. she recommended the blue moon regular and mango flavors as well as the chips and salsa as an appetizer, because we were gonna share a medium sized boneless wing set (which probably wouldn't have been enough). overall, the vibe was great and the food was good as always! my friend and i did have stomachaches the next morning--possibly because of the spicy mango habanero, so if you're not good with spicy food, beware of this sauce!!!"
terrible terrible terrible place. food is comparable to a kids cuisine frozen dinner. service has been good whenever i go. dont waste your time or money. nuff said
the place was the worst restaurant kitchen was to slow order the pulled pork sandwich it came out with basically no meat just bread & cheese had to send it back then it took forever never going back
"you guys want to have heart attack? go to this spot!! amongst all of the chains like (applebee's, outback, friday's, etc... ) it's definitely the worst. i came for lunch with my girlfriend and i've been here before, but this was by far my worst experience. service was ehh... we asked our waiter a couple of times for to go boxes and it took him about a half hour to bring just that... i ordered the sampler and it was bad! if you're lacking some salt in your diet come here because they load it on!!! my chips and fries were inedible. i'm not sure why but it seemed like they poured an entire salt shaker on my food... not exaggerating. i got the buffalitos which are mediocre tacos (not what's described on the menu) and they were so spicy!! i love spicy but it was most inedible. the drinks were weak and the bill was 80 for two people with crap food... never coming back."
"when you feel at home you continue returning to your place of comfort. you crave the food, drinks, and good service. jennifer was behind the bar .  as always a pleasure being here. also, frankie checked in on us. thanks to the bww family"
"i love a good wings joint.   this is definitely a joint and they have decent dry wings.  it's noisy but manageable; tvs everywhere (closed captioning recommended); friendly staff ... sweet but not too bright... lol!  oops ...they forgot part of the order... twice, (followed up with lame excuses). great martinis though! thanks for extra olives."
"i come to buffalo wild wings often. tonight our order estimated time of pickup was 7:40 pm, we arrived 7:46 pm. at 8:07 pm someone finally came to the pickup section where i then asked to speak to a manager. manager jose was the most rude individual i have ever encountered. i truly believe there is a difference between being a boss and a leader: a boss can point here or there and tell you what to do but a leader, they lead by example. by having jose as this establishments, the face of this business is at jeopardy for customers like myself and the gentleman behind me on line who nor longer will be promoters of this company, i will be sure to tell my friends and family about this experience, where the managers lack of empathy and not willing to assist appalled me and other customers."
"told there was a 35 min wait for 2 while multiple tables open or needing bus service. eventually seated at a broken table that was open our entire wait time. waitress arrived about 15 mins later..placed our entire order. (only saw her again when we needed the check.) drinks came another 15 mins after. appetizers and entrées came out together...had to wait another 10 mins for forks and knives. do not order the southwest steak sandwich...it's neither sliced nor steak...it's burger meat. or as per the manager  ""steak ums."" definitely not returning to this business...maybe the ones in buffalo are better."
"the service was pretty slow even though the restaurant was crowded. however, my server was really nice whenever he did come by. he seemed overwhelmed! there's a parking lot and this location is pretty big with lots of tvs. i was seated immediately after arriving at 9pm on a friday night."
"i came with my friends for their boneless thursday special where each wings are 75cent each. for each 5 wings, you get to choose a different sauce. i got the hot, parmesan garlic and the asian zing. each was full of flavor and came out piping hot. no complaints here!we also ordered the appetizer which comes with fried pickles, chicken tenders, chili fries and chips with spinach and artichoke dip for the table.they also had a new drink that ive not seen in stores yet: angry orchard rose cider!! all of us ordered one which was served in a wine/cider glass and also remaining in the bottle. it was light and refreshing and a good match with the wings.when i came here previously, the service was sloooowww but today, our waiter was super attentive! i didn't get his name but the guy with the tattoos and by the booths, you were super attentive. he came multiple times to make sure everything was great, made sure our food came fast and piping hot. he's the reason this bww got 5 stars from me."
this was so small. how is this a basket of onion rings?  i've ordered in house and have gotten three times the amount. never ordering from this place again.
"went on a tuesday night, was somewhat busy but not crazy busy. i waited 5 minutes to get seated. i had the worst service ever. it took 40 minutes for our chicken wings and fried pickle to come out. worst part is, there were tables that sat down after us but they got their food first! we told the bartender/waitress why our food isn't here but theirs is and she said that we ordered different food! they ordered wings as well!!! she didn't even apologize or come check in with us on how we were doing. it's ok if you forget our order, everyone makes mistakes but own up to it and make up for it. after we were done, our server wasn't even nearby for us to get our check. i saw another table get up and go physically to a server and said they waited 20 minutes to pay for the bill. honestly i shouldn't have even tipped 10%, the bartender/waitress deserved zero. please have her just stay at the bar instead of serving tables. she's absolutely lost and forgetful and doesn't care about her customers."
i am going too keep this short and simplenever order food late at night...you will be very disappointed...
on tuesday's wings are half the price. food took awhile to come. other than that trying the different flavors of wings was worth the experience.
"alright, i loved this place. sophie our server was reallyyy really sweet and friendly. she was talkative and very likable. we had a great experience here, trying their delicious food and drinks. the big jack daddy burger was delicious"
i been in different buffalo wild wings restaurant but this one in college point is the worse plus the kitchen are very slow however the place was't busy i got the worst dry carrots as you can see. the waitress are super slow too
"i would like to say that i really like this place the service was good our server emily she was really attentive, food and drinks was really good, but the hostess she was horrible terrible attitude, we went there at 6:50 pm monday (memorial day) she was cleaning the front door she saw us and literally she didn't care she continued cleaning the door she makes us wait until she finished she didn't say nothing not even wait a minute o something then she just look at us and say wait and with a horrible attitude she opened the door, and then she didn't ask how many were in our group then she just give us the table, to be honest i felt like i just wanna get out but our waitress emily make us feel a lot better.please pay attention to who you put as a hostess that's the face of the place"
"hmm now i know why this place got such a low review. they have the word ""wings"" in their name but their wings were really disappointed. bland, not crispy and kind of dry. they have nice especial on happy hour drinks and beers and appetizers. mozzarella and fried mushrooms were ok but not extraordinary. i won't be coming back here for their food. service was ok. the waitress kept coming back every 5 mins to ask if we were ok. it became kinda annyoing after the 3rd time though."
"i've come here several times because target is right around the corner.  the parking isn't too hard here because there's always many spots available. the food here does come out hot and fresh like most buffalo wild wings.  however, the service the few times i have come here was pretty slow even if there werent a lot of people in the restaurant.i wouldn't rule it out because parking here is never an issue.  i have come here once by accident during a football game and the diehard fans definitely made that dinner experience very unique, fun, and full of energy.  i would come back to this location since it's very convenient, if you drive."
"im not understanding all the negative reviews for this place. been here twice and both times, we were seated quickly and waiters were very attentive. i certainly didnt have any issues at this location.my review is based on the food. its ok, its certainly not the best wings ive had, but the atmosphere at this location is very nice and clean.i like that you get to choose a different for every 5 pieces of wings. the traditional wings tastes better than the boneless. the boneless are battered then tossed into the sauce of your choice,   which to me made it dry. as for the traditional, they were juicy and plump, but im also a dark meat fan.a tad disappointing was they didnt have some of the beers advertised though, they should really fix that. we didnt go late night or anything and they dont seem to have any drinks special during the eveing that would make the draft run out. maybe it ran out during their happy hour. i mean, its a sports bar, so beer/drinks is what really drives a lot of the customers, in my opinion of course."
"parking situation- good luck finding parking around here. it's very hard finding parking as it is around 71st avenue/austin street, id recommend taking public transportation there is a lot of easy buses/trains to get here. restaurant location- this place used to be a staples years ago, so the setup getting to the actual restaurant is weird (you have to go on an escalator & 3 flights of stairs to leave.) downstairs you will see a cashier/hostess but this is for the takeout area.service- we were seated almost immediately which was nice. the food took a little while to come out but it was pretty busy when i walked in so it was expected. (came here friday night). & our waiter checked on us and apologized for the long wait.food- this is not a five star gourmet restaurant -it is buffalo wild wings. usually it is either a hit or miss with the food. some days the food is dry and slow, other days its good and flavorful. today surprisingly it was really good. lots of sauce on my wings and lots of warm cheese on my potato wedges. verdict- don't come here if you are starving food will take long. quality wise is ok. prices are average, they don't promote any specials."
this was my first experience at this particular buffalo wild wings.the hostess just is completely stand offish zero eye contact no greeting and stank attitude she didn't even take our party a bus boy who was walking by bussing tables put our names down then strike one on the hostess then there's a line to get a table which would be understandable if the place was packed but it was completely empty. so the wait was 20 minutes for an empty restaurant strike 2... our waiter came right away and was very nice i believe his name was kevin all the orders came my sauces got mixed up but our waiter quickly corrected the mistake and brought us new wings within like 2 minutes. but as for the prep of the food here's where the last strike came. the fries we ordered were cold and soggy. the nachos we ordered were just chips and lettuce. the street tacos were dry and the wings weren't well cooked and kind of flavorless even with the sauces strike 3 won't be returning to this buffalo wild wings again. the waiter kevin was the only good part of the visit.
"i came here for the first time on tuesday, and i had pretty decent experience. the service was nice, and the food was great! i appreciate that this place is wheelchair accessible, i can take my grandma here some other time.our waitress was really sweet, and was very attentive, she even warned me that the wild sauce for the wings i ordered were really spicy, but i'm used to eating super spicy food anyways.the food was really tasty, and the dessert was so good. i had the chocolate fudge cake. i love the combination of vanilla ice cream, and chocolate cake. although i personally didn't like the chocolate chips on the outside of the cake.i'd like to try the dessert nachos next time. so far i've had a really good first impression with this place, and i'd like to make my next visit pretty soon."
"ordered two large set of wings to go most recently via the app and it was seamless to pick up, albeit with a slight delay; staff were all very pleasant.  had 8 different flavors and winners for me were the caribbean jerk, asian zing, and home bbq.  wanted to try the enchilada but it was merely ok."
this place sucks on so many levels..most workers dont care..service is slow..not even busy and waiting like 30 mins for just 1 large order of wings..
"i've been here a couple of times. the wings aren't that good, just like any bar. last time i went, a server named jasmine changed my tip amount..."
"we shared the large(st) order of wings so that we could choose 4 flavors: salt and vinegar, bourbon honey mustard, caribbean jerk and parmesan garlic. with a side of onion rings and sammy adams '76 edition we were good to go. the caribbean jerk was my fave of the night because it was sweet but not overly like the bourbon while maintaining depth and intricacy of flavor- tasted earthy and a bit floral with cinnamon and fennel... staying true to jerk style. thing is, bwb makes good plump wings (w about 15 flavors to choose from) and onion rings and (obviously) a decent selection of beer. mind you, they are no station house down the street for the true beer connoisseurs... but it's easy and cheap. great place to fill up on wings if that's what you're craving."
"ever since my first take-out here, i've been coming back many times to dine in. dining in is definitely a completely different experience. i've had many ups and downs with bww, mostly downs. other reviewers pretty much explained my unpleasant experiences. long wait time, incorrect orders, non-existent staff, and so on. although, i did have a great experience with the staff juan who was so attentive that i just had to give him more tips. but i never saw him again, where is he? he should be the model of bww's staff service.so why do i still come back? their food is outstanding! despite the fuss about the service, their food is always delicious. the portions are huge. from their burgers to salads to wings, i can't complain. plus, they still have the 1/2 off wings on tuesday, so i have to take advantage of bww."
"i always get wings from bww, they have a lot of flavors and i mostly enjoy the food. most of the time i do carry out and i order in the app. i ordered 20 pieces of wings and mozzarella sticks, so the wings only comes with one blue cheese, i paid for 3 more blue cheese which was 60 cents each, when i got home and opened my bag the wings was fine but i had 4 barely filled containers of blue cheese. it's  less than 2 dollars and it's just blue cheese but money is money, the worst feeling is going home and being disappointed in our order. the containers were so empty that you can see the bottom of the black container through the cheese. i literally poured all the sauce in one container because they poured one container into 4. what a joke. i could understand if the sauce was free but i had to pay for it. this isn't the first time i had problems with picking up food at this location but i always go back because it's the closest one to my house. and i also had a birthday reward and couldn't redeem it because they say their system is always down. this location need to be reviewed and the manager needs to give good customer service because we pay our money for our food."
i came here last night with my friend and we had such a good time. first i wanna say that our waiter luke was the best ! he was very attentive and always coming by to make sure we were okay! we got the strawberry coronarita drink and wings. and it was both just so yummy! will be coming back
they need more servers and people working in the kitchen! it was so ridiculous ..the place has plenty of empty tables but ppl are lined up waiting to be seated. when we were finally seated and ordered we waited 30 mins for our food to come out..again the place had plenty of empty tables.
"don't understand why there's so much hate. it's the same buffalo wild wings chain you see everyone else for better or for worse. i have only come here for tuesday half-price wings, and have only done take out, but each time i have come i have enjoyed the food. yea its just fried chicken wings with sauce; if you're looking for a bunch of wings for $13 with a wide choice for flavors, but obviously don't come here if you're in the mood for something else. your order will take 30 minutes + on tuesdays because everyone is eating here when half priced."
"i have a love/hate relationship with you bww. some days you are terrible, ignore me and treat me like a slave, but other days you are loving and deliver commendable service. is your bipolar emotional mood dependent on the day i visit or just how you feel like it that day?i found that i have not been discarded to the side and forgotten on tuesday nights. is it because you expect to have many customers because of the 1/2 off on chicken wings deal for the day and plan by staffing your restaurant adequately on tuesdays? but what about the other days?your saucy (not powdered) wings (although sometimes cold) and honey bbq chicken salad are so good that i cannot pass on the tuesday deal. perhaps i shall come only on tuesday. i see so much potential if the service was consistent all throughout the week. if only everyday was tuesday."
"i think this place is a pretty standard bww. although, on a couple of occasions, it has taken a while to be seated when the place was relatively empty. this a first hand experience once and an experience a friend had while waiting for me.other than that, pretty straight forward bww, i don't think it tries to be anything other than that. although, i expected that since i am in the area so often, i would recommend coming here more. however, i don't find myself doing that. i think the fact that there are so many restaurants on austin street is what possibly has this effect.maybe i will visit more often, and see if things have changed!"
we came here for a quick bite before a concert.  nothing was quick. not even our drinks. the food was topical buffalo wild wings.  the service was awful !!
"so, i was here to watch the nba final game 1 with my friends. during this time, they sat us in the corner of the place even though they were many seats open. i had to crane my neck to be able to view this tremendous display of basketball skills. in addition, the tvs kept dimming and becoming brighter. then they spilled icecream on one of my boys. yurdddd dont come here. food takes 30 mins to come. i will be back for another game tho."
so i come here on a wednesday night for some wings and beer. the wings and potato wedges are good but the service kills everything! i waited 5 minutes to be seated when the venue is 80% empty. i waited over 15 minutes for my appetizer to come and over 25 minutes for my wings to come. like damn that's wild. rick ross's won't stop definitely got you guys beat. this place definitely is a pass! the waiters suck. the service sucks! skip and head to wing stop.
"every single goddam time i order a burger or sandwich i get no lettuce because some retard cook always puts a soggy brown piece on it. i think maybe the cook has some form of colorblindness because he sees green instead of brown. honestly, would you eat this on your burger?"
"i came to this place with a couple of friends and we had to wait approximately 15 minutes to be seated even though half the restaurant was empty. when asked why the hostess explained that it was because the servers are assigned to certain tables/areas that are close together. we were able to get booth seating and i chose the cheese curd burger, along with chili cheese fries which were $2 extra. when i asked the waitress what exactly the chili cheese fries consisted of, she seemed confused about the question and was not able to answer clearly - not a good sign. my burger included wisconsin cheese curds, american cheese and hickory smoked bacon, along with lettuce, tomato and really tasty sauce. the burger was a nice generous portion however, the chili cheese fries definitely looked pitiful. the fries did not match the photograph at all and only had a tiny bit of chili and even less melted cheese. i didn't make a fuss about it because there were not that many beans (i dislike beans - yes, i know it's weird that i ordered chili cheese fries despite that fact). the skinny fries were not even good by itself. thankfully the burger made up for that. the bread that it was on was fresh, warm and fluffy, while the meat was cooked perfectly well done (which is what i asked for), coupled with the crispy and thick bacon, the deliciously melty fried cheese curds, cheese and flavorful sauce - everything came together well and i really enjoyed the burger. one of our friends came a little later and he ordered some boneless chicken wings, which you would think is a simple order but it actually took quite awhile for it to prepare. by the time they served it to him, we were ready to leave so we had it wrapped up. the service was okay. our server was pretty friendly but she also came by every few minutes to ask if everything was okay, which i thought was a little excessive. it interrupted our conversation each time. i won't be coming back anytime soon."
"i literally despise this location however, it just so happens to be the closest to my house. customer service here is absolutely disgusting. the wait time is always extremely long even though there's always empty tables in this very large establishment. overall, bww's menu consist of food that reminds me of those frozen dinners .. that you microwave. the wings, of course, are nothing to rave about. i do enjoy the wing sauces but that's about it. also-- parking is a nightmare around this area. closer to 74th you'll most likely find something."
"parking situation- good luck finding parking around here. it's very hard finding parking as it is around 71st avenue/austin street, id recommend taking public transportation there is a lot of easy buses/trains to get here. restaurant location- this place used to be a staples years ago, so the setup getting to the actual restaurant is weird (you have to go on an escalator & 3 flights of stairs to leave.) downstairs you will see a cashier/hostess but this is for the takeout area.service- we were seated almost immediately which was nice. the food took a little while to come out but it was pretty busy when i walked in so it was expected.

this was my first experience at this particular buffalo wild wings.the hostess just is completely stand offish zero eye contact no greeting and stank attitude she didn't even take our party a bus boy who was walking by bussing tables put our names down then strike one on the hostess then there's a line to get a table which would be understandable if the place was packed but it was completely empty. so the wait was 20 minutes for an empty restaurant strike 2... our waiter came right away and was very nice i believe his name was kevin all the orders came my sauces got mixed up but our waiter quickly corrected the mistake and brought us new wings within like 2 minutes. but as for the prep of the food here's where the last strike came. the fries we ordered were cold and soggy. the nachos we ordered were just chips and lettuce. the street tacos were dry and the wings weren't well cooked and kind of flavorless even with the sauces strike 3 won't be returning to this buffalo wild wings again. the waiter kevin was the only good part of the visit.
"i came here for the first time on tuesday, and i had pretty decent experience. the service was nice, and the food was great! i appreciate that this place is wheelchair accessible, i can take my grandma here some other time.our waitress was really sweet, and was very attentive, she even warned me that the wild sauce for the wings i ordered were really spicy, but i'm used to eating super spicy food anyways.the food was really tasty, and the dessert was so good. i had the chocolate fudge cake. i love the combination of vanilla ice cream, and chocolate cake. although i personally didn't like the chocolate chips on the outside of the cake.i'd like to try the dessert nachos next time. so far i've had a really good first impression with this place, and i'd like to make my next visit pretty soon."
"ordered two large set of wings to go most recently via the app and it was seamless to pick up, albeit with a slight delay; staff were all very pleasant.  had 8 different flavors and winners for me were the caribbean jerk, asian zing, and home bbq.  wanted to try the enchilada but it was merely ok."
this place sucks on so many levels..most workers dont care..service is slow..not even busy and waiting like 30 mins for just 1 large order of wings..
"i've been here a couple of times. the wings aren't that good, just like any bar. last time i went, a server named jasmine changed my tip amount..."
"we shared the large(st) order of wings so that we could choose 4 flavors: salt and vinegar, bourbon honey mustard, caribbean jerk and parmesan garlic. with a side of onion rings and sammy adams '76 edition we were good to go. the caribbean jerk was my fave of the night because it was sweet but not overly like the bourbon while maintaining depth and intricacy of flavor- tasted earthy and a bit floral with cinnamon and fennel... staying true to jerk style. thing is, bwb makes good plump wings (w about 15 flavors to choose from) and onion rings and (obviously) a decent selection of beer. mind you, they are no station house down the street for the true beer connoisseurs... but it's easy and cheap. great place to fill up on wings if that's what you're craving."
"ever since my first take-out here, i've been coming back many times to dine in. dining in is definitely a completely different experience. i've had many ups and downs with bww, mostly downs. other reviewers pretty much explained my unpleasant experiences. long wait time, incorrect orders, non-existent staff, and so on. although, i did have a great experience with the staff juan who was so attentive that i just had to give him more tips. but i never saw him again, where is he? he should be the model of bww's staff service.so why do i still come back? their food is outstanding! despite the fuss about the service, their food is always delicious. the portions are huge. from their burgers to salads to wings, i can't complain. plus, they still have the 1/2 off wings on tuesday, so i have to take advantage of bww."
"i always get wings from bww, they have a lot of flavors and i mostly enjoy the food. most of the time i do carry out and i order in the app. i ordered 20 pieces of wings and mozzarella sticks, so the wings only comes with one blue cheese, i paid for 3 more blue cheese which was 60 cents each, when i got home and opened my bag the wings was fine but i had 4 barely filled containers of blue cheese. it's  less than 2 dollars and it's just blue cheese but money is money, the worst feeling is going home and being disappointed in our order. the containers were so empty that you can see the bottom of the black container through the cheese. i literally poured all the sauce in one container because they poured one container into 4. what a joke. i could understand if the sauce was free but i had to pay for it. this isn't the first time i had problems with picking up food at this location but i always go back because it's the closest one to my house. and i also had a birthday reward and couldn't redeem it because they say their system is always down. this location need to be reviewed and the manager needs to give good customer service because we pay our money for our food."
i came here last night with my friend and we had such a good time. first i wanna say that our waiter luke was the best ! he was very attentive and always coming by to make sure we were okay! we got the strawberry coronarita drink and wings. and it was both just so yummy! will be coming back
they need more servers and people working in the kitchen! it was so ridiculous ..the place has plenty of empty tables but ppl are lined up waiting to be seated. when we were finally seated and ordered we waited 30 mins for our food to come out..again the place had plenty of empty tables.
"don't understand why there's so much hate. it's the same buffalo wild wings chain you see everyone else for better or for worse. i have only come here for tuesday half-price wings, and have only done take out, but each time i have come i have enjoyed the food. yea its just fried chicken wings with sauce; if you're looking for a bunch of wings for $13 with a wide choice for flavors, but obviously don't come here if you're in the mood for something else. your order will take 30 minutes + on tuesdays because everyone is eating here when half priced."
"i have a love/hate relationship with you bww. some days you are terrible, ignore me and treat me like a slave, but other days you are loving and deliver commendable service. is your bipolar emotional mood dependent on the day i visit or just how you feel like it that day?i found that i have not been discarded to the side and forgotten on tuesday nights. is it because you expect to have many customers because of the 1/2 off on chicken wings deal for the day and plan by staffing your restaurant adequately on tuesdays? but what about the other days?your saucy (not powdered) wings (although sometimes cold) and honey bbq chicken salad are so good that i cannot pass on the tuesday deal. perhaps i shall come only on tuesday. i see so much potential if the service was consistent all throughout the week. if only everyday was tuesday."
"i think this place is a pretty standard bww. although, on a couple of occasions, it has taken a while to be seated when the place was relatively empty. this a first hand experience once and an experience a friend had while waiting for me.other than that, pretty straight forward bww, i don't think it tries to be anything other than that. although, i expected that since i am in the area so often, i would recommend coming here more. however, i don't find myself doing that. i think the fact that there are so many restaurants on austin street is what possibly has this effect.maybe i will visit more often, and see if things have changed!"
we came here for a quick bite before a concert.  nothing was quick. not even our drinks. the food was topical buffalo wild wings.  the service was awful !!
"so, i was here to watch the nba final game 1 with my friends. during this time, they sat us in the corner of the place even though they were many seats open. i had to crane my neck to be able to view this tremendous display of basketball skills. in addition, the tvs kept dimming and becoming brighter. then they spilled icecream on one of my boys. yurdddd dont come here. food takes 30 mins to come. i will be back for another game tho."
so i come here on a wednesday night for some wings and beer. the wings and potato wedges are good but the service kills everything! i waited 5 minutes to be seated when the venue is 80% empty. i waited over 15 minutes for my appetizer to come and over 25 minutes for my wings to come. like damn that's wild. rick ross's won't stop definitely got you guys beat. this place definitely is a pass! the waiters suck. the service sucks! skip and head to wing stop.
"every single goddam time i order a burger or sandwich i get no lettuce because some retard cook always puts a soggy brown piece on it. i think maybe the cook has some form of colorblindness because he sees green instead of brown. honestly, would you eat this on your burger?"
"i came to this place with a couple of friends and we had to wait approximately 15 minutes to be seated even though half the restaurant was empty. when asked why the hostess explained that it was because the servers are assigned to certain tables/areas that are close together. we were able to get booth seating and i chose the cheese curd burger, along with chili cheese fries which were $2 extra. when i asked the waitress what exactly the chili cheese fries consisted of, she seemed confused about the question and was not able to answer clearly - not a good sign. my burger included wisconsin cheese curds, american cheese and hickory smoked bacon, along with lettuce, tomato and really tasty sauce. the burger was a nice generous portion however, the chili cheese fries definitely looked pitiful. the fries did not match the photograph at all and only had a tiny bit of chili and even less melted cheese. i didn't make a fuss about it because there were not that many beans (i dislike beans - yes, i know it's weird that i ordered chili cheese fries despite that fact). the skinny fries were not even good by itself. thankfully the burger made up for that. the bread that it was on was fresh, warm and fluffy, while the meat was cooked perfectly well done (which is what i asked for), coupled with the crispy and thick bacon, the deliciously melty fried cheese curds, cheese and flavorful sauce - everything came together well and i really enjoyed the burger. one of our friends came a little later and he ordered some boneless chicken wings, which you would think is a simple order but it actually took quite awhile for it to prepare. by the time they served it to him, we were ready to leave so we had it wrapped up. the service was okay. our server was pretty friendly but she also came by every few minutes to ask if everything was okay, which i thought was a little excessive. it interrupted our conversation each time. i won't be coming back anytime soon."
"i literally despise this location however, it just so happens to be the closest to my house. customer service here is absolutely disgusting. the wait time is always extremely long even though there's always empty tables in this very large establishment. overall, bww's menu consist of food that reminds me of those frozen dinners .. that you microwave. the wings, of course, are nothing to rave about. i do enjoy the wing sauces but that's about it. also-- parking is a nightmare around this area. closer to 74th you'll most likely find something."
"horrible service. idk why because there is rarely ppl there. ive never gone when it was packed but they always seem to take too long.i've went there 3 times and something always goes wrong.wings dry, dirty celery and poor service. ask the staff if they know how to provide quality customer service and smile in the interview. these pics are of wings that i had to return and make the make it ""wet"".... then they were good. and i take good flicks. and asked for different veggies and more dip"
"the worst!!!!!!!! i have a very bad memory so months will go by and then i forget how bad my experience is at this place so i'll go back but i think today sealed the deal. i can get past the rude take out staff, the long waits and their dirty shirts but why is my food bad?!!!i ordered the honey bbq salad and fries off the lunch menu and didn't bother to check my food as i was rushing back to the office. the chicken was so hard and (most likely from freezer burn) that it mad my teeth hurt. i don't really do reviews but i just had to today. it's unacceptable!!!!"
"ok so first off, waitress took forever to take our order; when she finally took our order, she had the most disgusting attitude. then went another lifetime to bring our drinks, proceeds to bring out the wrong order..just not ok the worst part? umm like an idiot i forgot my wallet on the table, probably because i couldn't wait to get out of there.. i realized this 5 minutes later so i proceeded to walk back and ask for it. the waitress ""had no idea"" the bus boy ""never saw it"" the manager luckily had it ""locked in the back office"" great! right?? umm wrong! it was perfectly put away after someone used my credit card to purchase some sort of concert tickets!!!!!! $136 dollar purchase. who did it? i'll never know, what i do know is that i'll never go back.disgusting place, disgusting people just disgusting."
"putting my rating down to 2 for this location y'all. i visit this place a couple of times throughout the year since it's close to me. i usually get the boneless wings and fries (it's always good) . so why am i rating them as a two this time around? i ordered the new chicken bbq sandwich and the lettuce on the sandwich was olddd !! also the fries was little old (sitting for a while) as well. thank god my waiter noticed that on her own and brought out an extra side of fries for me. i guess she seen the complaint coming lol. i also ordered a frozen drink and it tasted like complete juice, i didn't taste the alcohol at allllll mannnn"
"terrible place. they don't know anything about customer service. need to be re evaluated. worst place i'd been to. water was dirty asked for water in togo paper cups and the lady asked us if we wanted paper cups to pour our water in when we clearly said the water was dirty. also ordered a kids hamburger and a veggie burger came out burnt, told the waiter and he stated with an attitude that it was a hamburger."
service was crappy and the waiter barley came to the table. the food was also okay.. we had to ask for silverware and napkins...
the absolute worst service. the food is always late and i mean always late. would it kill it for the waiters to smile? is that not in your job description. to be friendly and welcoming. wings are also dryer than my ex girlfriend's sense of humor. whatever. avoid at all costs.
"we were doing a little shopping and my husband wanted to come here to get some wings.  i really didn't want to come here. i've been to a few of these franchises before and the the food is pretty standard bar food. great place to watch sports and have a cold beer and wings. walked in and the woman who was at the front desk was oh so rude. geez girl just pretend you enjoy life.  anyway, we decided to sit  to the left by the window and one thing i noticed all in that area....all the tables were dirty. crumbs, greasy tables and food on the floor. it was so gross. why don't they clean the tables once the customers leave? i don't get that. the rude girl wiped the table with a rag and we sat down. the waitress however was a breath of fresh air. i think her name was ashley or amanda. she had a big smile, repeated our order to make sure she had it right and was attentive to her tables. this to me is an example of what i believe a good waitress/waiter should be. we got our food and it wasn't bad. i ordered boneless buffalo wings with blue cheese on the side and potato wedges, my husband got the thai ginger wings and my kids had the chicken tenders with fries. the thai wings were pretty good. me being the paranoid customer i always say if they don't upkeep the place then what does that say about the kitchen? hmm. i wish they would get more serious and keep the place clean and hire inviting people. hopefully now that arby's might be buying them out they will make grand changes."
i really try not to waste my money or time eating at mediocre places but when im hungry sometimes i don't think. this was nothing to write home about... everything here was just meh and expensive. the best part was the boneless wings that you should totally wait until thursday to get it for 60 cents. the wrap looked better than it tasted and my fries were shockingly dry and old tasting. the service was just okay. would i come back and spend $80 on this? hell no.
"i don't want to be unfair to the few times service here has been bearable thanks to some of their better servers and other employees but the usual service here is an embarrassment. like everyone said, service is slow and unreliable. once, i ordered a large and they brought out a medium. i showed them the medium sticker and counted it for them. they went to bring out the correct order but instead brought out the same exact plate just ten minutes colder. from the time i sat down to when i received my correct order it had been well over 90 minutes. takeout is even worse since they don't decide to start your order until your expected pickup time. always double check your order and remind them to include blue cheese/ranch."
this is a ok spot to have a quick bite to eat or a drink i went with my man on a sunday to watch a cavs game. the food was mediocre and the drink was water down not enough liquor more drink then anything.
"amanda and her trainee, ira were phenomenal servers. very friendly, courteous, and attentive. i ordered the boneless wings with sweet bbq, asian zing, caribbean jerk, and teriyaki alongside an order of fries. pretty good stuff! i was satisfied with great food and service, but ...restrooms were not so great, but that's always been my experience with buffalo wild wings. i literally had to search for a roll of toilet paper, which i thankfully found under the sink and handed it over to one of the two young girls in the restroom. maintenance is just as important as the quality/value of food and customer service."
"my kids were complaining about being hungry while we were shopping at the gateway mall. i remembered going to buffalo wild wings and figured the kids would like it there, espcially my 5 year old son. (sports restaurant). we were seated right away and the table was wiped down one more time for us. once seated we waiited over 10 mins for the waitress and the place was not crowded. of course she apologized when she came back, but my kids were not hearig that due to the hunger pains they were both having. we kept our orders simple, but got some of the food back cold. pretty much the same issue i had from my last visit. i think i will no longer spend my money here. they have to do something about the waters and waiteresses attention to services and maybe make the customer feel welcomed. please visit at your own risk and don't say i sent you. chow!"
this is one of the best experiences i've ever had at buffalo wild wings me and my family came for a late night bite and so happy we had the best server ever. giovana had amazing customer service skills...like seriously this woman needs a promotion ! she was very attentive and so caring. before we got to her table this was a worker by the name of sonia who was the complete opposite of her we were a party of 5 and we wanted a clean table so we asked if the table could be cleaned she wiped the table down and never came back to serve us...thank god this made giovana shine even more and when we told her what happen she apologized for it. we were so grateful of the amazing service from this woman and she changed our entire experience.
"maaaann the service here gave me aids and i didn't even sit down to eat. we walked in and a party of 3 was waiting to be seated and we were next. there was 6   literally six waiters at the front welcome desk standing there doing nothing and our soon to be ""waitress"" told us she'd be with us. after 10 minutes of staring at 50 open tables and booth with 6 waiters feet from us, able to host us, she comes back and asks the host how many of us there were. i say 4, and she stares blankly at us. got so fed up we walked out. this place gave me service aids in the face."
"this place sucks. service was awful. our waitress had a sour attitude and was extremely nasty. took over a half hour to get our food and all we ordered was two small boneless wings. we finally received the food. our wings were undercooked and chewy.  we had to send them back and the waitress got annoyed and continued with her attitude. save yourself the time and microwave your own wings at home, it's practically the same quality, but theirs are worse."
"they have the worst service here. the food is good and so are the drinks but the waiters don't do anything in a timely manner. i waited 30 minutes for a water! lol, i'm laughing but i'm currently sitting here annoyed! don't come here, it's not worth it. can't wait to ask for the check that's gonna be an long ride."
"i have given this bww location sooo many tries. when food finally does arrive, it is mediocre at best.on my most recent (and final) time dining in, my friends and i ordered four different kind of wings. not only were the wings  barely warm and hardly coated in sauce,  they had mislabeled every single one.when this was pointed out, our server shrugged it off and didn't bother to rectify the situation. if you want to be given attitude, subpar service and food, this is definitely your go-to."
"i usually order to go.vegan burger available.as follows blackbean burger, no cheese, no ranch sause. you can add whatever sause you want. its so good. i have eaten it 3 times in a week and as we speak i sent my mom to the mall to pick one up!"
"came here last night after some shopping. we sat at the bar and had a couple of beer and wings. i give the bartender 5 stars! he was the only one working the bar on a saturday night. he was swamped but didn't complain and did his job. i felt so bad i wanted to hop over to help. despite having to make drinks for the entire restaurant and the bar, he was still attentive and tried his best to get to everyone quickly. the wings was good and the beer was cold."
"don't get me wrong i absolutely love buffalo wild wings, but the service here is hit or miss. sometimes the wait on the food is rather ridiculous. i remember when tuesdays & thursdays you felt like you were actually getting a real deal on the wings.  the price has increased so much, it feels like your paying just a little less than the regular price.always a great place to catch a drink before or after an event at the barclays center which is located across the street."
"yeahhhhh don't bother lol seriously i'm like the most chill most understanding person when it comes to food service and customer service because i've worked in both fields many years ago this place was like a cafeteria that was run by high schoolers so to make a long story short here is my gripe:the food is ok  i've had the food before via takeout so nothing award winning but gets the job donethe ambience is ok a bit crowded but do-ablemy main thing is where is the host,where is the customer service,good rule of thumb when you have such a large establishment where people come in to enjoy a meal it's a great idea to have a person greeting people on the way in and thanking people for even coming on the way out...i should not have the ability to be walking around your establishment in search of the host when i arrived with my family myself along with a few other folks were on the hunt for the host who went mia never truly greeted us just said ""when you're ready let me know"" like we're here and waiting to be seated so we've been ready the second we walked through the door. it's very disheartening to have to spend your money  but the staff look at you like your annoying them...that's not cool or welcoming which is what you sell in your marketingmaybe a little retraining can help i don't know.... i highly doubt i will recommend this establishment to anyone but best of luck"
"the worst service in the history of buffalo wild wings... i was here for lunch with my fiancée & 8 month old daughter when we came in we asked to sit in the bar area with the high tables & was told children were not allowed. now the new york state law is children are allowed as long as they are not drinking. also she was in a stroller so it's not like she will be sitting up on the high chairs...when we sat down to order i was informed that the burgers are only made well done. this is insane to tell me you only cook food one way!i then told the waiter i wasn't ready come back, he came back within 2 minutes & yet i still was not ready..my fiancée got her food and my order was not taken, it was not until i asked for the bill and they were taking her empty plate away was i asked if i wanted to order... i've never had such an horrible experience at a buffalo wild wings."
i've been waiting over 30 mins for an order of wings. that type of service is completely unacceptable.
"you can't really go wrong with b dubs. at least not with the food usually, but the service can get kind of bad. the person serving us seemed like he didn't want to deal with all our orders. we ordered a lot of different wing combos because it was boneless thursday, discounts on boneless wings! we came at 10-11pm so there was a bouncer checking ids. we were able to get 25 wings for $18 i believe. we ordered 50 wings. we also got angry orchard hard cider pitcher for $21. the flavors of the wings are always great. asian zing, lemon pepper, honey bbq, parmesan garlic are all great. i prefer the buffalo wild wings from 47th street more. place is bigger there and more clean."
"literally the scum of the earth, this place is trash. we came for the fight and they sat us at a table and no one came over, so we left after 15 minutes. thank god we didn't have to stay longer. we tried to tell them that no one came over to us and they blamed it on us and kept asking if we sat ourselves. we definitely did not seat ourselves the hostess sat us. these people are horrible, we tried to tell two different people that we were ignored and they were just terrible. i wish i never walked in."
"do not visit this restaurant!!!the worst service i've ever experienced. the food took over an hour, none of the servers wanted to help, they gave an attitude when i mentioned that something was missing from my order, my food tasted dry and reheated like it was thrown back in a microwave or oven and served to me and this is the second time that i've experienced this. it is the worst service i've ever experienced, ever!"
"i have been dining at this buffalo wild wings location for about 5 years but for some reason it was always too much going on for me to snap a photo. this is the third time i have came here for their fast break lunch which is pretty quiet around this time. the service is a good pace along with decent food and hostesses. i usually get the mango habanero but today i opted for less spice and ordered the asian zing with a side of potato wedges. for starters, i got the blue moon regular ounce beer at my server's recommendation. i enjoyed the food and chill atmosphere. yes, i will continue to revisit as it is my go to location for my favorite chicken."
i absolutely love buffalo wild wings but the service i've gotten the previous night from today was game changing enough that i would give this place a three stars. i got a waitress last night that seemed like she was absolutely done with her job and didn't want to be there. i've given her the benefit of the doubt considering there was a graduation and many graduates were walking in and having dinner. she got my order but gave me completely different saucing.great place but the waiters or waitresses you are great if you get them by chance.
"totally different vibe from san diego. long line, mostly african americans, usually i got 6 sides of veggie sticks in sd if i ordered a large original wings. here i got nothing but a few sticks and server told me they charged extra if i wanted more. please come to sd, california and see how they serve."
"there are too many reasons why i would not recommend anyone to this restaurant. from the start, there was already a long wait just to get in. there was no distinction between a line to be on the wait list or a line for people who were just hanging around in the area, so that made things confusing. once we were seated, we were not given any water. we actually never received any water throughout the whole course of the meal, so it was a good thing that we ordered other drinks. not sure if that's a normal thing, but i observed the restaurant and it looked like no one else had water either. the menu is also very dirty, it had food stains and fingerprints, which just made the whole experience even worse. nonetheless, i ordered the medium traditional wings, half hot and half wild. i liked the flavor of the wings, but i could tell there were major differences between the wings that were in my batch. about one-third of the wings were tender and the other two-thirds were either reheated too often or sitting in the kitchen for too long. they're known for their wings, but that was already a disappointment from my experience. to my surprise, the big jack daddy burger that my partner ordered tasted a lot better. however, that was not my meal and so i still had to eat the dry wings i ordered. they were just underwhelming and i knew they could have been so much better because i've had good wings at this chain before. all in all, we had a long wait, dealt with slow service, mediocre/below average food at a high price, and were just very dissatisfied with this location and what the restaurant had to offer. i won't be dining in ever again, but i would maybe consider ordering out during their half priced wings days."
"bww is hands down my favorite place to get wings. i love wings and every tuesday there is a half off traditional wings deal! you will most likely find me there. it is fun to try out the flavors and go spicier everytime you go! and for fun you should definitely try the flavor blazin!! see what is your limit and maybe shed a few tears. other than just wings, i love their nachos appetizers and fries. i learned that you can get seasoned fries, which definitely changed my experience. recommend this to wing lovers!"
was not like the others i've been too. very unsanitary. asked the waiter to take my beer and replace it because there was something on the rim the bartender thought she could wipe it with her finger and send it back!
"food is great, but the service is terrible.  plain and simple. i've been to several bww locations and their lack of service at this location is very poor representation for the brand.  sorry to say i won't be dining here again anytime soon."
"i come here every tuesday,there's always a problem or there running around with there heads chop off. 8/28/18 i ordered a large wings,flats,asian zing,hot/wild,now i waited 30 min and it was the afternoon and it was pretty packed at takeout,so i get my food and something tells me to check the bag,and of course i was gip outta 3 wings they gave me 15. i told the cashier i'm missing some wings she says are you sure you counted,hello didn't you see me open every box. now i have notice every time i eat there wings i have serious runs the next day tmi but it happens and i thought it was with the blazin so i stop ordering it. i never heard of chicken messing your stomach, be aware and always check your food sometimes it's soggy sometimes it's over cooked or have been cooked 2 and 3 times."
came here for a quick lunch before going to a show at barclay center. this place is really dirty. they don't seem to sweep/vacuum. it looks like they whip the scrapes of food from the table to the floor. this place is big but there's a lot of people and it looks chaotic. service is slow. we can never seem to find our waiter and they do not stop by the table. it is also really dark in the restaurant. we sat close to the window so we had sunlight to see our food. since this place is really dirty i do like to see what i am eating. they have a good selection of sauces for the wings.  we ordered the honey bbq and sweet bbq. i prefer the honey bbq. i tried both boneless and bone in. i prefer to have it boneless as it's easier and cleaner to eat. we also ordered the corn dog appetizer. overall the food is decent.
we did a take out order and asked for carrots and celery.... none were in the bag.  i think it could've been a better experience order date 8/4/18 15:08:08 order of large boneless
"this place is either a hit or a miss depending on the day and time. this time was a complete missed. more than half the tables were emptied, they were under-staffed and not enough cooks in the back. had to wait for a server, had to wait for food, had to wait for additional napkins and utensils. food was lukewarm (they nuked it in the microwave?). server was no where to be found, flagged her down twice, got the check pretty fast though. paid and got out of there."
"i came here to watch some football and the wings was just amazing. the service can be slow or fast depending on how busy they are but its a sport bar you can't expect much. my order came out quick and my glass was never empty, my server was attentive to my table."
"i'd give this bww 4.5 stars if it were for the wings alone (honestly, some of the best traditional buffalo wings i've had at a bww in a long time). but, it's also about the service and the price (and this one is pricey, even compared to dc location prices).it took a solid ten minutes for anyone to come to our table after the hostess directed us where to sit. and it wasn't packed at all, so it was kind of unexpected to wait that long. however, the service picked up once we finally had someone come to the table. wasn't the best, but i don't expect to be waited on hand and foot (is that the saying?) at a buffalo wild wings tbh.the high top section where we sat was really cluttered and chairs were all over the place, and it felt a little like the place could be cleaned more, but i got way past that once i got my fried pickles and wings. so so good. so good that i'd come back and look past everything else to get the wings again. it *is* mostly about the food, right?"
"nothing wow! it's a chain restaurant so don't come here expecting greatness! !! lol... hostess is always mia so just grab a couple of menus and seat in any available table!* servers are ok , nothing wow. they do their job but i guess is not their dream job so they don't smile!* bartenders are ok, they are fast.*food is good, again is a chain restaurant so everything is frozen! * bathrooms are clean i come here for a couple of beers every other weekend. is a good restaurant to drink and watch games."
"i go to buffalo wild wings very frequently and this time i was a bit disappointed at this location. i ordered on the phone and when i went to pick up the food was not ready. i had to wait quite a while as well as the order not being complete. they forgot to give the veggies along with only giving a pair of dressing with a large order. the wings were cooked way too much and were more on the dry side. the cashiers looked like they did not want to be there, they were not polite at all. i have been to many locations before and i am a regular at bww and haven't received bad service like this. please step up the game with your service because you don't want to give a great brand a bad name."
"hello...is anyone at the front! oh no...that's fine. i'll just yell ""hello"" until someone finally comes out so i can spend my money. yes, this happened to me yesterday. i decided to grab some wings thinking it would be quick and easy. it wasn't. when i walked in, there was no one at the podium and no one at the takeout desk. i yelled ""hello"" a few times, but alas no one heard my calls. i waited a few moments before someone came out. i placed my order and took a seat. here comes the next guest...and once again, she had to wait until someone came from the back. i yelled ""hello"" and, once again, calls went unanswered. she waited at least 5 minutes before someone came out. people...we are willing to spend our money in your establishment. why are you not out front willingly taking it. another guest came in and said she calls the back to have them come to the front - she was clearly annoyed by this. finally my wings came out. they were okay - nothing fantastic. also, since i had to wait to be ordered upon, i will not be back."
"definitely do not come for take-out. you'll stand at the counter for 20 minutes before someone comes out. if you do come to eat in, go straight upstairs to where the dine-in section is. i got a medium sized portion of traditional bone-in honey bbq wings and a side of roasted garlic mushrooms to share with two people, and it was enough to fill both of us. the roasted garlic mushrooms were basically breaded mushrooms; they weren't anything special themselves, but the dipping sauce was amazing. the peach smash cocktail was also pretty tasty."
"it's too bad that this place is nice and spacious. everything else needs a lot of work. upon entering the restaurant, my group waited downstairs for a hostess to come. we later found out that you had to go upstairs and go to a hostess desk there to be seated. this was not made clear at all.after finding the hostess desk smack in the middle of the dining area, we waited for someone to acknowledge us and sit us down, which took longer than it should have. clearly you can tell they are way under staffed.ordering beer was a struggle as pretty much half of the beer on the menu they were out. the boneless wings we ordered was lukewarm. otherwise the food is your standard bww food.overall, i feel like a nuisance to the employees just for choosing this place to get dinner. so honestly, i will not be bothering them ever again."
i've been to this location a few times as well. i love buffalo wild wings in general. i will say the only thing that i don't like about this location is it could be a little slow. most the time that i'm gone have been kind of late in the evening and i always sit at the bar with a young lady that is the bartender. i wish i would get her name but she's always so nice. she's a thin black girl works the late shift as a bartender. i'll be sure to get her name next time but she's always so nice and helpful. i will definitely be back.
"the wings are always delicious, nice and crisp, flavorful. the drinks are alright. nice and spacious, tvs everywhere. the wait for the food is always long"
"if i could give negative stars, i would. i walked in to get lunch and there no one was at the counter. i waited and a worker came out from the back, saw me, didn't say anything to me and walked back into the kitchen yelling for another coworker. still, no one came to help me. i even called the restaurant to try to get someone out front. the phone rang and still no one came out. i eventually walked out because it was ridiculous. i love the food here. it's sad the service has to be literally nonexistent."
"ordered take out in store but it took 25 min+ the food was hard, old and not fresh. i ordered snack size boneless wings and fries on the side. it was awful. this is my 2nd time at this restaurant. first time i dined in an it took over 30 min to get the same order of wings and fries they forgot to give utensils and took forever to bring me water and napkins."
bww always has stellar service and this spot was no different. we were rapidly seated and attended to quickly. the food was succulent and the chicken dropped off the bone. the buffalitos were delicious. i only took off a star due to the bathroom condition. otherwise solid spot to have dinner in harlem or grab a beer.
"i just want to say that i visited this place yesterday and i want to give a shout out to alonzo. i came in yesterday when it was really hectic. there were people waiting to make orders, pick up orders, and the phones were ringing off the hook. he was very patience because if that was me i would have probably went crazy. i noticed so much was going on for him and he was the only one at take out, so i just waited. he worked very well under pressure and made sure everyone one was taking care of once things settled down. so i'll give him a big shout out and i hope he is recognized. i gave the store 3 stars because i'm assuming since it was so busy the food was rushed. the wings were over cooked and it wasn't satisfying at all. they gave me two little boxes with fries and they barely filled it up. probably would come back, but it would probably be because it's right there and it's the closest thing. not my first buffalo wild wing restaurant that i would go to."
"our server yasmine was sweet but very busy with a large table so the manager, patrick, came over and took our drink and meal order and let us know our server was atuck with another table. that was very nice of him and showed how good of a manager he was. he basically ended up as our main server for the evening. this was my first visit and it was enjoyable, as one could be at bww. i'll come back. i just hope they keep this location 100 and it doesn't go the way of the rachet like the nearby chuckee cheese.note: all members of your party must be 21 to be seated in the lounge area."
"i'm livid. we had a reservation for 9 pm. we were seated promptly and our waitress was nice and took our drink and food order no problem. flash forward over an hour... we haven't seen our waitress. drinks are empty. we're hungry. i finally flag down another waitress and ask for the check since we'd been waiting over an hour. as i'm doing this, our food comes (we got a sampler platter.) waitress says she ""took so long cuz i had to cook the food myself."" uh ok. except everything is cold. no offer to refill drinks. empty ketchup on the three nearest tables. i finally snap and ask for the check and to just take my food home. another woman helped us and was very prompt, polite, and apologetic. wish she had been our server from the start. bww is my favorite chain, but don't waste your money. cold food and garbage service. will not be returning."
"this is one of the worse restaurant chain location. for starters  their service extremely slow in general, when you walk in usually there's no host at the door to wait fr your sitting, neither the rest of the servers do anything about it if they see you standing at the entrance. you can't go ahead and sit down on your own because they will move you because "" there is no waitress "" assigned to the table.once you're sitting down waitress can take their time to come to your table and introduce themselves. you have to ask for napkins and the boat because they won't bring it to you. you can wait for almost an hour for you food, it has happened!! 45 minutes count, and when it finally came was the wrong order on top of everything, so i have to wait another 25 minutes more. horrible !they will bring your order incomplete to the table, no celery, carrots either ranch/blue cheese will come with, which is part of the order if you ask for wings, and the waitress had the nerves to tell me i need to ask for it upfront !! like really? and when she said she will bring me some, she took my wings back to the kitchen just to ""add""  the celery carrots and ranch, which made me very concerned about what she might of done to it! to which she took up to 5 mins to do it so, i don't understand. i've been here many times, and each experiences is same or worse as the previous. told myself i wouldn't comeback here at all! and this time i'll keep it."
okay this was my first time coming to this restaurant first of all the bbq chicken was good ! which my gf had & i had chicken quesadilla they were soooo cheap with the chicken the tortillas tasted good but like i said barely any meat inside i will never order that ever again .then i went into the men bathroom and i realized there was nooo toilet like what if i had to take a crap then what?  ridiculous smh
"bww is my favorite chain fast restaurant when i was in illinois. i love the sportive vibe and the choices of the flavor of the wings.   but this one in nyc is just so disappointing from every aspect. 1. the wings are very slim! it also feels overfired, with very tough and burned meat. it feels like some leftovers and then refried. 2. the service is sososososo slow! i don't know how come it has so few waiters at a busy game night with many people. 3. everything that is on the sides is in scarcity!  the free celery and carrots are just so small and 3 pieces each. maybe because of the rich food i got in bww from the countryside is so good i just cannot accept it here in nyc."
this service here is absolutely terrible . my food was cold. me and family was here at 7pm we didn't receive our food till 8:40pm. it wasn't even busy. i wanted a few drinks and then there was no bartender. how is this supposed to be a great food establishment but you have service like this. i will never visit this place again ...... our server was so sweet though and tried her best to make sure we got our order correct
"monday evening was the first time in my life i have never tipped. my service was so atrocious i couldn't justify it. clearly there was a staff issue, as there were waitresses at other sections of the restaurant serving tables. unfortunately, when we approached the hostess about wanting to watch the hockey game she told us to sit wherever and we chose near the bar which apparently had no waitress or even a table runner assigned?  it was not a busy night that's what makes this experience so confusing and frustrating. there were probably ten occupied tables of the many on the second floor. we asked before we even sat down if one tv could be turned to the hockey game. between the three of us we probably asked the bartender and hostess ten times in the span of thirty minutes for them to change the channel. half the time they tried and failed on the ipad the other half they faked like they were going to and then proceeded to ignore us to the point of us having to physically wave them down as they walked by us. all of this before we even received some water for our table. once we finally achieved getting the hockey game we went through another war of trying to get a waitress to take our order. another patron near by said he hadn't been asked his order for forty five minutes. eventually the hostess brought us a menu and the nice kitchen manager came by and took our order and did his best to make us more comfortable. honestly the issue is not that there was clearly a short staffing or poor serving structure or that the staff didn't know how to use the ipad system but that the staff that was there didn't even try to meet us half way, or be honest about the slow service and do their best, they just ignored us and that is unacceptable for paying customers. next time i would literally go to any other establishment then deal with this frustration and give them my money."
pictures can say a thousand words.... the place was 1/2 empty...but we had to wait 20minutes among a group of others who were also waiting...why you ask?? because this place was filthy. the tables were dirty and not cleaned because management wasn't on top of it. i don't blame staff it's not their job to manage the situation. the bar was empty with 5 customers and he wasn't seating anyone. i was ready to leave but the rain had us trapped and the basketball game was on so you already know my husband and son were not going anywhere.even in harlem this was horrible like super disgusting. i have pride for my neighborhood i've been here a while now...in fact a lot longer than wild wings has been here. would be nice they showed pride in the neighborhood and took care of business and their costumers.
"i've been to this bww a number of times since it originally opened and i'm surprised at all of the low reviews, but maybe i've just gone at really great times. i've been with a group of friends at a table ordering food and drinks,  and also at least twice alone at the bar for food/drinks. every time i've come here, the service has been great and the food as well. i've never come at a time where it was super busy so i can't speak on what the service would be like in those instances. i personally prefer to sit upstairs at the bar because you get direct attention and faster service. i'd definitely come back here whenever i'm in harlem"
"i pick up orders for delivery from there all the time, and one of the biggest complaints i see is, that they don't cover the  boneless wings with enough sauce.  i personally order boneless wings and some are coated with sauce and some are not.  i wish they would read their reviews to help them better serve the customers.jelly"
"i am an avid wing lover and love going to wing spots. this location is not worth it despite being in times square.the service is terrible and will ruin anyone's experience. whether you are picking up or eating-in, it will take forever to receive your wings. on average, there will only be one person at the front desk taking orders (which is ridiculous because of the traffic and location). this place is only worth it on tuesday's and thursday's simply because of the wing deals. otherwise, you can get bigger wings at a bar or another spot in the area. it's a good spot to catch sporting events but unless those events are on tuesday's and thursday's, not worth it."
"let me preface this by saying that the people who work here seem to be nice people. with that being said, i must say i was very disappointed with my experience. the service was neglectful and disorganized at best.when i arrived, the restaurant was not busy. there were a handful of seated tables and many employees milling about, and yet, there was a relatively long wait. the host first referred me to the bar, as i, in all of my entirety, composed a party of one, but the bartender sent me back to be seated properly. (i would have been fine at the bar as long as i could order some bloody hot wings.) i then had to wait another fifteen minutes to be seated at a table that had long been empty, and then i would wait another fifteen before a server would check in with me.my server, when she finally appeared, was sweet. she had my drink and some napkins delivered to the table promptly, and my wings came in a timely fashion. it took some twenty minutes, however, before i could get some ranch dressing, which i'd requested from my server and another who eventually remembered. by that time, i'd already finished a portion of my hot wings and the rest had grown cold. no one offered me a glass of water or a refill of soda during my meal either, which may sound like a silly thing to complain about, as there are larger issues in the world, but i was already having a rather rough night, and it would have been nice to be reminded that i do, in fact, exist. for the $30-something i dished out for a small order of wings, a side of fries, and a soda, i could have gone somewhere far nicer.i understand that the staff are young, and this may be a first job for some, but i implore the management to encourage better service. i reckon a lot of people must pass through those doors, and really, what matters is the little things."
"went last night and waited 45 minutes for a sandwich and wings. the waiter came by about 15 minutes after we ordered to tell us our food would be right out, and again ten minutes later, and we then sat for another 20 minutes before it came out. i have to wonder why the manager only came by after we all looked pissed. she did give us 25% off our bill but it was too little too late, because as the food came to the table i was literally getting up to cancel the order. i've worked in the industry and if there is some kind of mix up, or the food is going to take over an hour, the manager should probably be informed prior or come by sooner. i also am not sure when you use computers to place orders, how an entire order is ""lost"" in the kitchen. i worked in the restaurant biz for almost a decade and either the kitchen is behind or order wasn't sent, computers don't lose them. it doesn't sit well when you're already disgruntled and then are lied to. especially since the server at the table next to us informed her table that the kitchen was very behind as there were a few  chefs out and let her table know ahead of time their food would be delayed. not sure why the manager just couldn't be honest about the kitchen crashing.overall extreme lateness could have been handled much better by the server and the manager. and the food was just ok.would not go back to this location."
great place to watch the games and chill after catching shows around the theatre area.service was a bit slow and the servers could be a bit more friendly.
"i came in around 5-6 on a tuesday (for happy hour of course) and i was expecting this place to be packed, but it was not and i didn't have to wait for a table. after being seated almost immediately, our waters quickly came and we placed our order. the food came quick and our server was friends. one i was finished with my plate, it was cleared almost immediately and when me and my date asked for the bill, our server was quick and prompt. i ordered the parmesan garlic and salt & vinegar both of which weren't spicy, but my date had lemon pepper which was fine but he underestimated the spiciness of the chipotle."
"came here with a friend on wednesday for lunch before our 2pm show. we ordered a sample, which comes with chicken and 3 sides + 3 sauces. we ordered boneless chicken but they gave me wings. it's fine and we asked for sauces but they came with nothing. the lady said our waitress said we asked for nothing. what?! i'm confused coz she even recommended us to get certain sauce. anyways, the lady was kind enough to get us some sauce. but guess what, she brought wrong sauce to us.....we just gave up lol"
"dude, whatever. i am not ashamed to say that on my birthday (also valentine's day) i wanted wings and fries for dinner. and i'm also not sorry to say that no local restaurant has been able to prove they do traditional, flat wings the way that bww does. so, yeah, i went to eat at buffalo wild wings on valentine's day in nyc. and you know what? no regrets. ha. most bww are the same, with some exceptions for really bad locations. i'd say this location was somewhere in the middle. our order of all flat, extra crispy traditional wings and fries came out almost right on this busy night. the wings weren't extra crispy, but they were still good. the fries were hot and fresh, and the celery wasn't gross. the bartender, who was also our server for the evening, was really friendly and courteous. he seemed to move a little on the slow side and i noticed some people around us waited a really long time for their food, while others were getting their's right away. but, to be honest, my bf and i received great service from him. the wings and fries totally hit the spot and i'm glad i got to eat something i knew i would love on my birthday."
"came with a large party. service was good. food was good. food came out at a decent time for us. everything seemed fresh. we had a great waitress, i forgot her name. i wish we would've gotten more carrots and celery. bathroom was missing tp when i got there. overall this places is a must when your craving wings (especially on a tuesday for happy hour)."
pass....  unfortunately you have to rate this spot.  don't waste your time or your money they're the same nasty people who live in harlem work there.  god forbid if you ask for refill or more napkins andddddddd don't send your food back if you trying to eat buffalo wild wings for the 1st time don't let this store be your 1st time experience because it will be your last.
"i love their honey bbq chicken salad, i just love it!! the service is okay, but i would've give 5 stars if they serve waters for every customer while waiting for their drinks and foods."
the food is good but the service is terribly slow. since it's located just a block away from times square a lot of tourists come here and during peak hours the wait time is over 30-45 minutes. i've come here a couple of times and had to wait at least 15-30 minutes before we were seated and it took another 30 minutes before our orders came. the wings were very good and we totally loved the thai curry wings and the parmesan garlic wings. they also have delivery but i've heard that it's terribly slow too.
"the employees were pleasant, though there weren't enough employees for the  number of customers in the restaurant.  the menu is the standard fair, so there isn't much choice.  if you are looking for chicken wings, this is a great place to visit.  but there isn't much else on the menu.  the prices aren't great either.  it is a convenient place to go, and predictable.  so i might go back if in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to do so."
"won't bother ordering from seamless again. cold, messy, incomplete order.. top it off with phone line that doesn't work... classy"
"honestly i had really low expectations when i was going to get a quick dinner here before a show because i've never had an amazing experience at bww. this location was definitely the best one i've ever been to. service was quick and sweet, food came out quick, and we were seated right away. it's still a chain, so food is only as good as you could expect it to be for a bww. the sampler deal they have going on is actually great and the fried pickles were amazing. a good quick bite to eat/drink for normal prices (not crazy manhattan price)."
"rounding up to a 4, because service was amazing and i was also pleasantly surprised with the black bean burger! possibly the only vegetarian entree option here, but the patty is super good. i've had some pretty bad black bean patties, but this was delicious. their buffalo sauce is so good as well. on allset, you can choose which side you want with your entree, where you can add fries for no additional cost, potato wedges, veggie slaw, etc for 1.80$ more. ordering on the app was super easy, they even have a counter designated for the orders from food apps. food came promptly. cole slaw was decent, it tasted a bit bland after a couple bites but i didn't want to go too carb heavy tonight. friendly environment, not so crazy as i've seen other sports bars. was a nice place to relax at the end of the day."
"buffalo wild wings is buffalo wild wings. it's just great wings. however, what made this visit a little bit better was our server annakay. she was honestly so sweet, so kind, and just incredibly welcoming. it was such a refreshing thing to see. so while the food is good, the 5 stars is really for our waitress. we loved her. and her hair is fly. if you do decide to go, i'd ask to sit at her section. annakay. you the goat. love her."
excellent services with excellent food! our server rich provided excellent services! food is out quick and tasty on a tuesday busy playoff game night. wings and mini corn dogs are a must to order.
"i never come into times square. too many tourists! a couple of friends were visiting. wanted to meet at this bww. i suggested a local place but, i went with the flow. so. first impressions. it was a decent sized bww. they dident have any specials when we went. i have been to quite a few bwws i have even rented the location in dc out for a party. the bar was pretty busy. just like every other bww. there are tabs everywhere with every game you can think of on. our server was good. we ordered 2 orders of the regular bone in wings bbq and hot. then 3 orders of the boneless. i had 2 beers. i usually don't drink beer. but i thought grey goose and wings might not be a good idea haha. so i went with the beer. the wings came out relatively fast. wings were cooked fine. there was a lot of people walking past. the place was very loud! like really loud. most of the people looked to be tourists. or young 20-30 yr olds just sitting at he bar watching the games. i forgot to take pictures of the food. i took pictures of the to go wings i took back home. sorry. overall. i don't like the area. i dread times square. the location was fine. everything was good. i have no complaints. if you are visiting and you want to go to a chair restaurant. give this bww a shot. if not there are a bunch of other chains located close. pros:- every sports game is on tv- wings were goodcons:- location is crowded and touristy- extremely loud inside. hard to have a convo"
"i don't understand why there's a 30 minute wait to be seated when there are at least 12 empty tables (that are visible from the waiting area) on the second level. if you're understaffed, please plan better.i also don't understand why our waitress is covering tables upstairs and downstairs. our wait time to place an order was longer than it should have been which is going to affect her tip. it's unfair to her that management's poor decisions are going to cause her to have a lower tip because she's very nice. if it's due to call outs, you should ensure you're properly coaching and holding staff accountable. i'm very surprised that this is the service at a location near times square. the service at the harlem location is much better."
"for an airport bww it wasn't too bad, it was definitely better priced than the burger joint down the terminal; which sells 20$+ burgers. i mean you're going to pay a lot for anything in airports, but this place wasn't too bad. the food was definitely filling and too much, so we felt it was worth the price. however in the end we should have just shared a meal and called it a day! the mango habanero is definitely spicier than i remember. i was sweating my booty off! thank god i was smart and added a side of ranch as well ha! my husband order the hot buffalo wings, and he too was getting a good sweat going on hahahaha!! the wait staff was definitely quick and on point. we didn't wait long for anything. it was a pleasant time however the prices were just a tad bit too steep."
"terrible experience. wait 15 minutes to be greeted and if you're lucky. staff has no concept of customer service. it's like they're doing you a favor. order time is nearly 30 minutes. normally that's okay but in an airport setting, you need better throughput. smaller tables and tables of one suffer at the hands of large groups. us business travelers suffer significantly. you'd think the business traveler would be most ideal, but i guess not. no root beer or dr pepper and a few other fountain options. pos system issues. this location definitely needs some attention. the franchise agreement needs some customer experience metrics included in the contract because after this, i'm staying away from all b dubs regardless of the location."
"before you eat at this place jfk terminal 4 buffalo ww; look at the floor, look at how many customers are eating... needless to say i did not follow my own rules!when we were seated i noticed four servers in the corner all on their cell phones, customer waiting for food, customers waiting to pay, customers waiting for a manager but the worst part cold food, servers with a bad attitude, manager at the bar watching tvcorporate should close this one down and put up a papa john pizza, heck a chucky cheese would have been better!$37.75 for two beers & fries (hot beer & cold fries) and an absent manager what a shame...gm."
"we did not have a great experience at this buffalo wild wings in terminal 4.  i gave it two stars because our order was surprisingly correct.  we sat here for a couple hours, and not just because we wanted to, but the service was extremely slow.  our server would disappear at times, and he frequently forgot what we asked for.  i asked for a box at one point, and my friend wanted the checks, but we kept having to remind him when we managed to snag his attention.  we had a lot of time to spend in the airport, which i am thankful for because we would have been very stressed about the experience if we were on a shorter deadline."
"worst dining experience ever. the restaurant is severely understaffed. we were there for over an hour. at the airport. with a flight to catch. the waiter didn't write anything out. my food cane out cold. my sister ordered chips and salsa and onion rings. they didn't come out. i had to enquire about her food. when they finally came out, her food too was cold. waited and waited for the bill. i finally informed the waiter that we had a flight to catch. he asked the manager for the check, and directed me to the credit card terminal. i relayed our experience to the manager and he didn't care. he didn't even acknowledge my presence. the manager punched the check information into the credit card terminal and walked away. i completed the transaction myself. when my receipt printed, i asked the manager if i should tear i t off myself, since he walked off. his response was ""i came back"". corporate really needs to take a hard look at the operations here."
"this is probably the worst buffalo wild wings i've ever had, the service was unbearable, the server was cursing and singing nicki minaj during our whole order; as if we weren't even there, even to a point when my daughter started singing along, curses and all. i can't believe that even when i asked her to stop singing profanity in front of my daughter and she wouldn't. also, i would like to point out that the manager, i think his name is ofer, or olaf whatever, he's very rude and doesn't care about the people that is dining in his establishment. the servers disappeared multiple times and we had to kind of bang on the table to get their attention, they were to busy about the past shooting that occurred. im never recommending any of my friends or family to this place ever. i'd rather stand in that long line at mcdonald's. horrible management and staff!!!!!!!!!"
"we had time between flights to catch a bite to eat and i got the chicken caesar salad. the chicken tasted good but there wasn't much chicken in the salad, it was overpriced and service was really lousy. i guess you can't expect much from a restaurant at the airport so if you watch your expectations you'll be fine. the popular restaurant seemed to be the shake place but the line was way too long for the amount of time we had. if you pay with a debit or credit card they make you follow them up to the front of the restaurant."
"overall rating: dmy friend and i each got a $15 food voucher from delta due to our 4.5 hour flight delay. we went here for a quick lunch. the service was pretty slow. if you want to pay by credit card in the second room off to the left, you need to follow the waiter to ring it up at the bar! the hostess stand is on the far right, which is hard to see coming from the opposite direction.we both got the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich, which came with french fries, plus sodas. the sandwich came with the top bun off to the side. it had sad orange and white drizzles across the top. as unappetizing as it looked we didn't want to go elsewhere and spend even more money on overpriced, bad airport food. at least it was hot and crispy. the fries were ok. we tipped on the amount before the voucher was deducted. i would not return to any buffalo wild wings location if this is any indication of their food quality. it wasn't worth it even with the vouchers! save your money and calories and go elsewhere!"
the sampler was a nice size and it was pretty tasty.  the chili and nachos weren't too desirable but the wings were ok.  the mozarella sticks were obviously frozen but they honestly weren't bad.  i don't have to return though.
"i had a good experience here - got what i paid for and had good service. i'm from rochester which has a local chain with comparable food and i just never got around to trying bww so this was a first for me. the default medium sauce wings met expectations and the tacos were good too. i saw some other people eating burgers that looked delicious and next time i'm looking forward to trying one of those. at first my wife and i were thinking about trying a kebob place because that sounded intriguing, but then we started reading all the one star reviews and opted to play it safe with bww, and i'm really glad that we did. thank god for the internet!"
"very bad service, too slow, food cold, beer warm, what's up with that!, place , people didn't look involve in the customer service."
tomoya .... was amazing... she provided excellent service and made me feel very welcomed snd relaxed... thank you tomoya for a lovely lunch... you are thr best... fulljoy
"got food poisoning. that's all i have to say about this place to give it one star. my bean burger was honestly one of the grossest i've had. burger was mushy, the bun was soft. i will not be returning here anytime soon."
what can i say it's airport food despite that it's buffalo wild wings. the boneless wings seemed a bit overlooked to me. our waitress barely checked on us the entire time. our potato wedges looked like they were the last left when they fried them. it was just uuugggh ok. hence the one star. i can't even push out another star if i wanted to.
"call me foolish for ordering a burger at a wings place. but i'm still moved to write this review because the ""food"" i ingested at this joint was just that terrible. i was told burgers would take about twenty minutes and still signed on because i was early for my flight. it seemed reasonable because they were busy anyhow. what arrived was a dry, tasteless, tiny hockey puck of a burger on a mediocre bun. it was smaller than a mcdonald's burger, to give you a sense of scale. and the fries that accompanied it weren't even lukewarm! they were stale and mealy like the kind of leftover fries you might find on your coffee table the morning after a night of heavy drinking. the insult to the injury was the price tag, which was just shy of twenty frigging dollars. the manager and cook should be ashamed that such garbage made it to a paying customer's table.the extra star is for the fact that the hostesses were (attractive and) reasonably nice. essentially, they were just doing their jobs, but at a place with such horrendous food that actually comes across as commendable. i seriously advise skipping this place. i would have been more satisfied with a bag of doritos."
"worst place to grab a bite to eat at jfk. my husband and i were ignored and the entire staff got an attitude when we looked their way and gave the ""hi, hello nervous smile"" -  anyway, to make a long story short don't go here unless you're a group of single dudes.  they got helped within seconds of stepping in here.  ohhhh our server was so slow and had attitude helping us until it was time to pay, she was hella quick to get that tip with a smile and a ""thank you ma'am and sir....."
"if i could give less than one star, i would. service is absolutely horrible. waited 10 min and no one came to offer a drink. asked for a manager (who happened to be standing around with 5 other employees doing absolutely nothing), she said with the most smug face that's it's going to take at least 10 min for the bartender to get me a water. i left after that. you're not going to take my money and have horrible service. thanks but no thanks. never going here again."
"i've been to this bww location before but it was nothing like the service i revived today. i missed my flight so i had some extra time on my hands. when i first arrived it was a bit busy, but my server ahmad made sure to say hello and show me the drink menu, he also gave me great recommendations. sasha, another server came by to take my food order, i felt so special!! they have great personalities, made me laugh, and got me back in a good mood after my flight issues. so i wasn't just here making new friends lol. i had the asian zinger and thai curry boneless wings. i loved that the still had a good crunch to them despite being drenched in delicious sauce (too much sauce - always a good thing). so glad i decided to stop by here instead of a boring, basic airport ""brasserie."" bww has good music, hennessy, good view, and stellar staff. thanks again ahmad and sasha! see you guys next time"
waiting for my flight i hopped over to bww. love the wings and the food. i had a drink angry apple. don't recommend. and chicken tacos with my sauce of choice. i love mango habanero. good amount of heat and sweet.
"i wish i could give this place 0 stars. the food itself was ok but the service will stop me from coming here ever again. we waited by the ""please wait to be seated"" sign for a very long time with no server even looking our way until finally i went up to one to ask if they do take out, which was what we wanted to do. he pointed to a kiosk area and said that was where the take out was so we went and stood there. again, we were standing there for a while with no one coming to ask us what we wanted to order or anything. finally my sister went, again, up to a server and they told us to order at the bar. this is after we were standing around for about 10 minutes with no one giving us any instructions or even coming up to us at all. we finally ordered our food at the bar and then waited for about 20 minutes. when our food came they got our order wrong and skimped us on the number of wings. save your time and money. don't come here."
came here to watch the 49er's game... and omg... so many screens... so many options to choose from!!! we came here just before the game so we could get some seats for our party. and wow it got packed super fast! come here just before the game and you'll find seating! server boy came and helped us right away and since we were there for a long time... it seem like food came out fast! lolwe got beers... beers...beers... there's also a $5 special. overall: great place to hang out and watch the 49er's game!
"buffalo wild wings will be buffalo wild wings. don't come if you're super hungry cause they'll take an hour to make a couple of wings. gave a star because food here is still good and i'm still gonna go :/update: also, expect to wait an hour for your check."
"buffalo wild wings use to be my favorite go to place for wings and burgers. when they first opened, the service was excellent and the food was amazing. i use to have to wait for my food to cool down just to eat it because it was so hot. but now buffalo wild wings changed. ive been to this place many times bc the service and food was so great but now im watching it fall apart. every year ive watched the place lose customers and employees. it seems like every month an employee quits. there turn over rate is higher than ever. i have friends that worked here before and lets just say the management isnt that good... i recently went there last night at around 11:30pm 09/18/18. as we walked in the dining room was closed so we walked to the bar area. as soon as we got there, it was not busy at all. there at least 5-7 tables that were open but just filled with trash! no employees to be found to get a table cleaned up. so we walked to a table got some of the trash and put it on another table. we sat at the table for 10min straight with out any employee asking us even for a drink or a menu! one of the employees walked right by us as if we were invincible. we eventually got tired of waiting and we left to go order take out. once we ordered take out it took approximately 30min to receive our food. wth?! really guys cmon man. and you know what the best part was, it was cold! the amount of frustration i felt was real. we just left because it wasn't worth my time to argue with the employees. this use to be my favorite place but not anymore. goodbye for ever!im writing this review in hopes that the management team or the owner of this franchise would please fire his h.r department and try to recruit new supervisor and store managers because from the looks of it, it seems like everyone they hire has no customer experience or its there first job. in conclusion, this will be the last time i go and order from this buffalo wild wings. im willing to drive to the one in union city thats 30miles away than deal with the service and cold food thats offered here. and dont even get me started about the night shift crew.."
"i will start off this review by saying this place is not very good and you should avoid it.the customer service is not great and the staff is comprised of teenagers who don't know anything about customer service. you will also have to wait every time you come here and it's not because they are overly popular. it's because the staff is slow at cleaning and clearly tables. the food is not good at all. the portions are small. the quality is far below average. the flavors are bland. and the food is badly presented which makes not look good either.even though the quality and service are bad, the prices are higher than average. the location also sucks. the parking lot is shared with the mall, so there is never any parking that is close.overall, this place is not good and there are much better options out there that deserve your hard earned money more."
"the macaroni was slackin but the wings were smacking!!! yes, the wings were on point - lemon pepper & sweet bbq -- great seasoning to da bone!! the mac n cheese seriously lacking seasoning and where was the cheese?? bland cup of noodles.  need to work on that dish. my daughter and her boyfriend said the wings were flavorful and you can't find a better place in san francisco with these types of wings.  they were happy customers.  the frozen blue hawaiian drink was refreshing, good and felt like i was in paradise. definitely give it a try. the ambience is laid back, sporty, tvs with several baseball games. service was good.  i would recommend this location. happy yelping!"
"nice spacious sports bar with many screens on all sides. service was a little  slow.  our waitress was not as efficient and maybe new..  we had to wait to order, get forks and extra a sauce, despite the place being half full. the food was good but not great.  the parmesan and garlic wings did not tasted like parmesan and garlic.  it was kinda spicy, but we just ate it to avoid waiting for another order.overall, nice place for finger food, good for sharing. service was so so but a  great place for watching sports."
"slow service, food that was cold and unappetizing, no drink refills unless asked and the bill took forever to arrive and come back. the server also removed the receipt that had the survey code for us to leave feedback. unacceptable service. if i could give no stars, i would."
"went there wednesday night. these towels were on the floor the whole hour i was there. multiple servers walked over them and just ignored them. i asked a server about them and his reply was ""i didn't put them there"" and walked away. servers were slammed and i never seen a manager."
"my first time trying bww was in riverside and we would go there all the time especially for their tuesday specials. their wings were flavorful and super saucy.i was pretty disappointed when i came to this location. the place was pretty empty when we came for lunch on a saturday. my friend and i each ordered a small traditional wings which gives you 9 wings and two choices of flavor. we chose the caribbean jerk, asian zing, spicy garlic, and lemon pepper. we also shared a sampler which was way too much food for two small asian girls. the wings barely had enough sauce to coat it which made it seem like they were using the bare minimum to save on the sauce. service was slow - took about 40 minutes to get our food. imagine how long it would take if the place was more crowded. tip: you can ask to try the sauces before you order. they give you some fries to dip with the sauces."
"i've been here countless times and finally had to write a review after a horrible experience.the service has always been a downfall but this time was just a tragedy. i walked in to a pretty empty restaurant (not even half full), waited at the podium to be seated but no one ever came to greet me and i ended up standing there looking like an idiot for 15 minutes. there were other parties sitting and standing behind us also upset and wondering why no one was helping. there was a waitress standing at the take out line helping customers come in but didn't bother to acknowledge us or ask for another worker to come seat people. i noticed the floor manager was just standing around looking off into space by the kitchen. i got extremely annoyed and just walked over to the open bar seating area (21+ area) to seat myself...from there it gets worse! a handful of servers walk by and don't even come to the table or give me a menu. i had to flag someone down just to get any service. i waited almost an hour before i had to ask my server to check on the food wondering why other tables were getting their food even though they were seated after me. when he finally came with the food, i never saw him again. ran out of water, and didn't get a refill. i also realized they don't even have tuesday wing specials anymore...although i've experience pretty bad service at most bww, this was hands down the worst one to date. always terrible servers as well as waiting time for food to come out even when they aren't busy. i don't feel like they do their job consistently. their food isn't very cheap or great either... i come here because i live really close by, but now i rather just make the drive to wingstop."
"today i ordered those delicious mini corn dogs. but i don't know what happened. after calling the restaurant to get an estimate for the delivery that was already late, i think they tried to rush it and over fried my food. my order was late, cold and didn't taste how i expected. burned and extra crispy. i didn't wanted to write this review but i'm just not satisfied with the way you treated me today. thanks for ruining my dinner!"
"this restaurant serves the worst wings ever! my order was too salty and tangy. i wasn't able to consume more than 2 pieces. i ordered 4 different types of wings: salt and vinegar, spicy garlic, thai curry, and buffalo. all four sauces/seasonings were a major disappointment. all four were over-seasoned and salty. i won't be coming to this location again."
we waiting 20 + min for the first person to acknowledge that we had been seated and then take our order.  1 beer took 10 min to arrive.  food took 30 to arrive and our order was not complete.  food quality has gone way down hill and it was pricey to boot (3 kids and 1 adult with 1 beer should not be $75 at a place like this).  dirty tables everywhere and no one willing or able to help at all.  seemed very under staffed.  will not be going back to this bww and maybe not any bww given a choice.
"the server leo asked for my id and said, ""i just have to ask because you're asian and you could be under 21 or over 40 and i wouldn't know."" after he could tell i was irritated he tried to save it by saying, ""or maybe it's just your hairstyle."" good one bruh. aside from being insulted he was the worst server i've ever had. all i ordered was a blue moon and french fries. he approached my table after half and hour asking me if everything was going alright. everything was okay except i'm still waiting on my fries? he comes back with room temperature fries saying, ""don't worry i'm here for you."" where were you when my fries were warm fool."
"ordered online to pickup at 1:30. came in at 1:33 and they said ""your order is not ready yet."" never gave an explanation why it wasn't ready or when it will be ready. just a ""i don't work in the kitchen."" 40 mins later we finally get our order, never coming back again."
"this is probably the worst buffalo wild wings i have ever been to in my life. came in and told it was going to be a 20-15 min wait. sounded good i'm a patient person. but it took over an hour to be seated and as you can see by the picture half of the tables were empty. the host was also a jerk when we simply asked why it was taking so long since it was empty. he claimed they were ""short staffed"" in a very condescending way. the only good thing about this whole experience is that our waiter luis was very nice and apologetic about the whole situation. luckily the tips go on an individual basis here so we tipped our waiter making sure he only kept our tip. i can honestly say that i hate coming to this bww and tend to stay loyal to wingstop. would not recommend"
"i don't usually review based on service but after numerous visits recently where the service just kept getting worse and worse after waiting for 30mins hungry and not having a single person come to my table i walked out finally reaching my breaking point. bww food/wings aren't amazing but enough to satisfy a craving, but when the service takes over an hour to get your food or the servers don't come to your table even after waiting 30mins it is not worth it. i don't understand why this place is so bad, each time i've come it has been during non busy times/not during lunch or dinner rush or any warriors games. you see plenty of servers walking around but it's like they don't know how to stop by and acknowledge a customer with a menu or water, or the check. for a chain restaurant i don't have high expectations for service or food to begin with but heck when i'm seated i think it's fair to get a menu or drinks within a few minutes. i would have complained to a manager if one were visible but no surprise i could never find one. i would not recommend anyone go here strictly based of the absolutely awful service, you'd be better off going to safeway and making your own wings as that would be faster to get food. you can have mediocre food and be ok but when the service is total garbage it cancels out the food."
lots of tvs and the wings were decent. service was friendly and upbeat. ok experience overall.
"i have never received such terrible service. my friend and i sat here for 30 minutes before being acknowledged. our server ( tall bald dude) brought us our waters and we waited another 40 minutes to order our food. i understand it gets busy but the least you can do is apologize for the wait and check up on us. after waiting another 40 minutes our food arrived. not once did our server ask us if the food was okay, if we wanted a refill, nothing. on a good note, 5 stars for jonathon! you can tell this kid enjoys his job because although he was busy, he was doing whatever he needed to make sure his tables were happy. three tables left before us, because they received everything in a timely manner, and they left happy! my friend and i had to ask him to help us and he did so with a smile on his face! thank you johnathon!!!"
"i rarely give 1 star reviews, but this location, which about 4 years ago was a constant 4 stars, has really worked hard and earned a 1 star review.where to begin?  another reviewer i saw mentioned trash bags on tables and trash all over.  we didn't see it this visit, but have seen that at this location before and were disgusted.this visit started with a 15 minute wait (plenty of open tables), and then my wife and child went to the bathroom.  that was a disaster for them.  on the way over, my slipped on a spill on the ground and did a faceplant right next to an employee.  does that employee comment or say anything?  nah - they continued talking to another co-worker.  after all, if a customer falls down - what does it matter.  buffalo wild wings doesn't care about customers.  then, in the bathroom, apparently one employee had staked out most of two sinks with makeup and other fashion accessories and customers using the bathroom had to share a sink.  the buffalo wild wings motto seems to ""customers last"".after being seated after about 15 minutes, we waited 10 minutes until i got up to say something as no one had paid attention to us.  we were ignored.  i saw other customers in the same boat.  that at least got someone over who took our order.  our food came out much later - but they didn't have silverware so gave us plastic utensils that were in to-go bags...it's so sad, because my wife and i used to love the service here and going here...but this definitely was our last time eating here.  we're done with the poor service and waitstaff attitude and not caring about customers.  it starts with management, which stinks at this point.  sad, but true.  this is a shame, because we do like their wings...but it's just not worth it anymore."
"this place is a vegan introvert's version of hell.  it's loud with enough tv's showing such an enormous variety of sporting events as to make even the calmest person exhibit adhd.  the environment distracts from the rest of the place.  it could be spotless or a total cesspool, i have no idea.  which i suppose is another clever outcome of the tv's.the service is generally prompt and attentive.  i've never had an order messed up.  everything is precisely as i've ordered it, which given the large array of options is definitely saying something.  the portions are good, not exactly generous, but sufficient (and i'm not exactly hiding behind any flagpoles)  the food is classic fried bar fare.  the pretzels with the beer cheese is quite good, and the fried mushrooms are a surprise.well worth a special trip."
"the food was bad. like real bad. my wife and i got the nachos to start and the large boneless wings with the flavors being honey bbq, bourbon honey mustard, buffalo and habanero mango. the nachos felt like they ran to the stop and shop next door, bought nachos chips, tostitos cheese, canned chili, shredded lettuce and sliced jalapeno, threw it on a plate and brought it out (which took 20 minutes so maybe they did). it was easily the worst nachos i've ever had.the boneless wings had very little flavor to them. they either just tasted sweet or hot, and were completely dry and cold. they were heavily breaded with little chicken inside. for a place that has 'wings' in its name, you'd expect them to, you know, have good wings. the only good thing about the experience was our server, maria, who apologized for the delay in the food coming out and took off the wings from our bill. we will never go there again or any buffalo wild wings unless they start to really try to improve their food and kitchen capabilities."
"it's a good place to go to watch the game as they have a bunch of tv's, plenty of beer on tap, and the wings came hot, fast and fairly tasty. the service was good too! granted we came on a monday when the pats weren't playing, so you're milage might vary.we had the dry rub buffalo, ""desert heat"", and lemon pepper wings. the kitchen messed up our order and gave us extra buffalo wings instead of the lemon pepper, but the waitress quickly corrected that and got us the rest pronto. we kept the extra wings no charge. in my opinion the desert heat wasn't that spicy, but the lemon pepper wasn't overly lemony. it's a good place to catch up with friends and eat some wings for a good value."
this is my first time here and we will definitely come back! fast and friendly service. great beer specials and my favorite was the parmesan & garlic wings. my brave family ordered the wild wings. we had a super friendly waitress that made small talk with my children and was super attentive.
"we have been going to bww for years so we were very surprised when we stopped here for lunch and left dissapointed. the service was very prompt and friendly, and shawnlee is the only reason for the second star.  for the first time at a bww our boneless wings were cold, dry, and stale. the ceasar salad was sweet for some reason. great place to watch the game and grab a drink, but do not order the boneless wings if you eat here!!"
i have to say that i was not impressed one bit with the service at this location. i am giving this location based upon the poor service with a rude attitude. i believe her name was heather?  and serving near the bar tuesday 3/6/2018. i really doubt any further visits.
"went there yesterday for wings, did an online order and paid for it. told them what time i was picking it up. got there 10 minutes before and waited about 20 minutes for my food. not only that, they messed up my order and when i called the manager refunded me the difference. wings were good. favorite is the mango habanero"
"worst service. horrible customer service.my wife, myself and my 2 boys arrived at 615. seated in an odd way, (no other way to say it.)after sitting for 9 minutes with nobody coming over, my wife stopped someone. a few minutes later ""rob"" came over and didn't address the situation at all. when it was mentioned to him his reply was, ""you couldn't have been here that long. this is my section and i was just here"" when we confronted him on it, his reply was ""ok, whatever"". do not go here. horrible service and ride employees"
so i used to be a frequent customer until i brought my children and wife one day......the bald manager josh kept staring not at my wife but at my children!!!!!!!!!! absolutely outraged he should be ashamed of him self
"this was my first time at this restaurant and i had high hopes. we decided to sit at the bar for dinner and drinks, it was disappointing to say the least. the bartender was unbelievably rude, she couldn't have cared less that we were even there. we ordered a round of drinks that weren't super picky but definitely particular and she was incredibly dismissive. first round of drinks came and it was completely wrong but i didn't complain because the food was delicious. i ordered the second round and again it was specific, when it came it was not even close to what i ordered. i sent it back, said we were all set and asked for the check. while waiting the waitress stood at the end of the bar with her friends, clearly talking about us and laughing. we still tipped her and left quickly but it was honestly the worst customer service i've had in a long time."
food is good for sports fan and beer lovers.. they have great collection of fired food
"came here last night, sat at the bar and had dinner with my boyfriend. we have been coming here for years. nicole the bartender is always very friendly and always gets our order correct. we love the asian zing wings and the mojitos. we love coming here and we love nicole"
"took my mother to lunch here the other day. for a weekday and not even 3 yet, it was super crowded. no one to help seat us and we had to settle for a high table near an exit door. not ideal. the menu just isn't that great if you don't want wings (and yes, i know - why go if you don't want wings..). we got an interesting mini corn dog starter. the crust tasted like a sweet doughnut. not in a good way. for lunch, i went with a hamburger. it was way over-cooked. the fries were just okay. my mother tried the quesadilla and she thought it was all right. nothing too special and not spicy at all. for dessert, we tried a mini chocolate cake. looked like they had scooped it out of the rejection pan and put it in a paper cup before serving. i'm not sure how they could call that a dessert and sell it for as much as they did. slow service as our waitress was also the bartender. i wouldn't return any time soon."
great atmosphere and great food!  i love that they are open super late!  a great place to watch a game and eat some wings!
horrible place to eat at mostly everytime  i order the chicken finger dinner plate the fries taste so salty old cold and stale it's gross and the chicken is nasty idk what to say about this place it use to be good way back then
"something about this branch of b-dubs seems to put sand in people's vaginas.  these reviews would make you think this was a mcdonald's with a rat infestation.it's buffalo wild wings.  if you choose to go here, you probably fit into one or more of these categories: (1) you know and love the brand; (2) you wanted to watch a game in a festive environment and don't mind eating fast food; (3) you've had so much to drink that you'd be happy chewing on a sweaty sock; or (4) you stumbled upon it.whatever category you fit into, you either know what you're getting or you're not particular.  if you're not particular, then the food is fine.  it'll do.  even if you stumble upon it, the restaurant's appearance should be a clue to the type of food you're going to get.  there are large tv screens all over the place and the word ""wings"" is in the restaurant's name.one more time: it's buffalo wild wings, not chez marie de paris.to be fair, i should disclose my biases.  i first ate at b-dubs in college in the midwest.  a couple of my buddies and i frequented b-dubs as much for the blazin' hot sauce as for the atmosphere.  bartenders and waitresses alike stopped to make conversation with us and everyone walked out at 2:03 am having made new friends.  we'd get free samples of beers and a bartender in a good mood might give you a buyback every now and then.  it was perfect for carefree college guys who wanted to get away from their girlfriends for a bit, have uncensored conversation, and scorch their taste buds.when i moved here, i was happy to discover that massachusetts had a b-dubs within reach of the mbta system.  i happily made the hour-long trip from fenway and felt a wave of nostalgia walking in.  because this is massachusetts, however, i was prepared for some cultural differences.  namely, more brisk service and less chattiness.  and while that might be true of the braintree branch, the saugus branch captures what i remember about my beloved college b-dubs: the staff smiles and they apologize when things get slow or if they make a mistake.  one bartender actually stopped to chat and break my balls about how flat indiana is, like he'd known me for years.  i even got propositioned once.  i would have said yes if the request hadn't come from a dude.but even without all that, i couldn't care less because - and here's the other bias - i love their boneless wings.  i know boneless wings are the ugly girl at the wing dance.  but i don't care because i get my boneless wings with blazin' sauce.  it's hotter than any buffalo wing sauce i've tasted.  so whatever i lose in manliness eating boneless wings i make up for by eating twelve of them with blazin' sauce washed down with jameson neat.  that'll put some hair on your huevos.the boneless wings have a crisp, rich crust that stands up to sauces.  when you bite into it, you hear a pleasing crunch before your teeth sink into white-meat chicken that is both tender and firm.  the sauce is an inviting bright orange.  it has a crimson hue that warns you of the impending pleasure/pain dichotomy your tongue is about to experience.  and so far the wings have never tasted of old grease like they do at other places.i understand if these didn't match up to your favorite wing place in allston.  buffalo wings seem to inspire stronger opinions than roe v. wade.  but if you have access to the internet on your phone and common sense, you likely know what you'll be getting.  as far as awful service goes, i've never experienced that at this branch.  i can't deny that i've written some whiny reviews because of bad service (for another b-dubs, in fact) but not until i've experienced it regularly.  so before you walk in here, temper your expectations because, after all . . . it's buffalo wild wings."
"debbie took care of us and she was awesome. always came over to refill our drinks, checked on us multiple times(we were there for the games). our food did take a while and it wasn't packed in the place and we only ordered wings. not debbies fault. also the first beer my boyfriend ordered(blue moon) was half foam. its supposed to be 2inches. he didnt even take one sip and once the foam settled half of his beer was gone. we didnt say anything.the wings were delicous!"
"buffalo wild wings is a great place to watch a game, but don't expect anything fancy. bros, families, and people just trying to drink a beer and wings frequent here. usually we have waitresses/waiters who half take an interest in you, but this time we had a great waitress taking our order! costa is amazing and genuinely makes sure that everything is going well and didnt mind we were kinda quiet hangry bc she made sure we were taken care of. great game and great vibe. thanks costa"
"i ended up going into buffalo wild wings while i was waiting for verizon to repair my phone. i decided to order the combo which is five boneless wings and five regular wings with a side i also decided on a beer.my servers katrina and christine were great other than i think a there was a little bit of confusion i was asked if i wanted a tall or a regular stella i decided upon the regular stella since it was in the afternoon the regular size stella cost $6.50 however they had a special, a tall stella was six dollars i wish someone would've informed me you always assume that the tall cost more than the regular i would've loved to have a larger beer for $.50 less.the girls were very nice so i think it might be an oversight at least let's hope so?i was extremely surprised when my combo came out the wings boneless and with bone cooked correctly but the buffalo sauce was just drizzled over them????  they tasted fine but i could've bought some frozen wings at the supermarket and a bottle of buffalo sauce and sauce them after i cook them it would be the same. this was a little bit disappointing. thank god the patriots game was on and we scored 14 points in the first quarter which was how long it took me to push the wings down and drink my regular size brew. they should change the name to the wings are not so great. however the atmosphere for the football game was great the place was packed they had large tvs everywhere the atmosphere was good the barmaids were very polite and attentive it was actually a fun place.  unfortunately the wings don't match the atmosphere. the restaurant was clean and tidy plenty of elbow room while sitting at the bar tvs were great definitely a fun place."
"review is still true as below except i feel like service has gone down hill.also makes me laugh that reviewers justify terrible service with ""well itz just a wing spot whadda ya expect"" or associate no frills with shit service.if the hole in the wall spot down the street from me can do excellent service, why the fuck can't i have that same expectation for chains like this?"
the place was kind of packed. the service was sub-par. our server gave off the impression that she hates her job. she paid more attention to the tables with guys than us. rarely came by to check if we needed anything. and drinks were not as advertised in the photos. they came in small glasses which made me feel ripped off.
"something's up with this place. i've been coming here since it opened a few years ago. although i wasn't the best restaurant i've been, it was a good place to have wings and a couple of beers. and it looks like it's going downhill for the last few months. you can easily see employees smoking outside in a group (i don't see all of them washing hands after they're done with their cigs), tables and chairs are not cleaned properly so they're sticky. service is slower, and server turnover rate is at a point where i used to visit this place at least every month, and it's not easy to see the same server again. the takeout table by the door is where the music system is (i'm assuming), and whoever's working at that table tend to play the music that he/she wants, sometimes really really loud. yesterday evening they were playing slipknot and white zombie. i do enjoy listening to slipknot too, but at buffalo wild wings on friday night? so loud to a point that i can't hear what my friend is saying? everything's definitely gone downhill and i don't even want to blame the employees. this is 100% the fault of the management."
"i only come here if i'm desperate for wings and desiring the 1/2 off traditional wings deal (which doesn't exist anymore, so i have little reason to come). my experience in western new york has told me that this chain is just so-so. the traditional chicken wings themselves are pretty large. the sauces, however, were not nuanced enough for my taste. they just had raw and uninspired heat that didn't really impress me. the spicy garlic is probably my favorite flavor. the boneless wings are a mixed bag. they're breaded modestly, though it's just average. the sizes of each boneless wing varies greatly. you'll feel ripped off with some of them.there's a pronounced stale beer smell in some parts of the restaurant and it feels kinda sticky here. take-out is a favored option."
"i liked this place. i went there over the weekend after i finished taking care of something i had to do in the mall.the place was pretty busy. lots of people both at the bar and in the dining area. but the service was still quick.i had never been to this place before and it took me a while to look over the menu and decide what i wanted but the waitress was very patient and let me take my time with it.they had lots of appetizers, sandwiches, and chicken wings available with many different types of sauces. i ended up with just a snack size order of the boneless wings with ranch dressing on the side and some french fries. everything was delicious.the only complaint i have was that the music was overly loud. other than that everything was great."
"service was good. food was not.wings were warm, no flavor inside.. the sauce wasn't enough to make up for the plain taste. got the philly cheesesteak wrap, which was ok. good amount of steak ... believe it comes with cheese queso or some type of sauce within the wrap (look at menu descriptions). the sauce add a good flavor. fries were fresh and crunchy.the big daddy burger was overwhelmingly sloppy. meat was dry and again, no flavor even though there's a bunch of stuff on it. it definitely live up to its name but almost trying too hard to make this burger work. food was meh.. probably don't recommend eating there but getting a drink by the bar and watching the game is ok."
"the front staff are very cool and friendly! our server on the other hand didn't seem to care at all. another server had to take our drink and food order. our server checked in twice and the second time was asking about dessert while we were in the middle of eating. we waited forever for our check (another server came by and cleared our table while waiting for the check) and when our server brought it over, it was the wrong check!!!  i talked the the manager (from a different bww location) and then my server magically appeared and stared at me when was talking to the manager about her service. (didn't make it comfortable) do yourself a big favor, don't go!"
food was below average among bww joints. slow service. staff were chatting themselves all the time.
"this. place. i've never felt like i've been in the twilight zone more. i came here with three friends for sunday night football expecting to have great beer and better wings. they were out of at least six beers. the worst part about it is that the waiter would take our order on a beer, take ten mins and then get back to us that they were out of that beer. when visiting this location mentally prepare for the following:nachos without hardly any cheese, rotten fruit for garnish and slimy lettuce in a the salads. prepare for 45 mins to get a round of waters, beer to be served one person at a time, and appetizers to come out with your entrees."
this place needs a visit from corporate.  worst buffalo wild wings i've ever experienced.  came here on a thursday night to watch the first game of the season and they had tennis on.  i sat at a high top and waited 15 mins for someone to finally acknowledge me.  this place wasn't even busy.  i finally got them to put the game on and they told me they don't do audio?  they brought my wings out and forgot my salad waited another 20 minutes.  i spoke to the manager and he didn't care.  this place is trash and has poor leadership.
"i want to give 0 star or if i could do minus i will put -10 star for staff at buffalo wild wings at south shore plaza, ma. i and my husband have been there for 5 times. the first 2 times is fine except the server is always disappeared and long time cook. the 3nd we called in and place an order on phone. after we picked up, no side order that we order which is the dip for nacho so we decide to call them and ask, they told us to go back to get it. that the way they solve problem. the 4th time, i pressed order online and set up pick up time at 10.50 pm. we got there at 10.55 the order is still not ready and they told us to wait about 5 min but we got food almost midnight!!!! we got home and missing carrot, celery and we cannot call them back since it after midnight.  this time( will be last time forever!!) i order online again by download their app to avoid the mistake but yes....mistake still. i decided to call them and hope they might improve on this but what i got from the staff name ""katie"" was- no any apologize- she told me go back there and get your stuff mam.- she told if she were me, she will check the order before she leave the store every time since they cannot improve for that. so i have to improve by myself to check on my order even though they have checking paper that come with receipt. - she said the carrot and celery did not charge any cent from my card because it's come with my traditional wings obviously it's a charge since we order wings and we suppose to get it. or am i wrong? - that lady who's name katie never tell me about she sorry for mistake and she hope that might be better next time. so 3 times that they make a mistake they complain on me because of i paid them and i have to pay attention to check on mine order since they not gonna pay any attention on that because it is not their business to take care of customer! this is 1st place ever that i ever complain. i never heard staff talk to customer like this before why? because i used to be a waitress too. i gave customer credit or ask them if they want us to delivery the missing stuff for honor of our mistake. first word come out from my mouth if i make a mistake or even just because of customer not satisfied with our food and service is ""sorry"" instead of complain on customer. i know customer is not a god or whoever that important to u but u need customer to run your business!!! right? and then u get pay by working with them! if u don't like to work...go back home and don't come to the restaurant again. keep yourself in the small room."
"sauces for the wings aren't even good. if you do choose to dine here, try the mango habanero. i've been to this location twice and i regret it every time. the food is repulsive."
went to eat some lunch.  around 2. get the the front desk waited for along time to be sited  fyi the place was almost empty.   the service was not good took at least 30 mins to get our food and the order was wrong and cold .     look for a better place !!
"i'm giving this particular branch of b-dubs a one-star rating solely for the lack of atmosphere and one asshole bartender. i don't know his name, but he has a shaved head, a light beard, and a weird voice. he's about  5'9"" and he works mondays, tuesdays, and wednesdays, at least. when i walked in, he shot me an undisguised look of disgust and took my order mechanically. it took much longer to arrive than usual.  at other, busier, branches, the food arrives quickly regardless of how busy they are.  while waiting, i ordered a double jameson and a glass of water and went to the bathroom to wash my hands.  when i came back, only the water was waiting for me.  bald bartender asked me for my id.  he hadn't asked anyone else for their ids since i got there and didn't ask anyone else for their ids after.  i gave him my passport and he looked at it discerningly, channeling his inner customs agent and temporarily fulfilling his dream.  he looked at my visa for a full five seconds and flipped several pages with the authority of someone way more important than he actually is before handing it back to me with a satisfied grunt.  then, i finally got my double jameson.these aren't hard to pour, but they took forever to get to my spot on the counter.  this dude was in charge of everyone's drinks, but there were only seven people at the bar. the girl who brought me my food was friendly.  i wished she was the one serving drinks because the bald dude seemed tired of life.  anyway, i ordered blazin' boneless wings.  blazin' is the hottest sauce you can get and it's hot.  three wings in, i was suffering.  i was chugging water and went through my glass pretty quickly.  i also wanted another jameson.  despite passing me several times and watching me puffing for dear life, bald bartender didn't refill my glass until he was good and ready.  i had to go to the restroom to spare the other patrons from the sight of my face melting.  twice.  this was the extent of my experience.  let me put things in perspective, though.  this was the same day that brussels was bombed.  i look middle eastern, though i'm the farthest thing from it.  bald bartender was probably striking a blow for democracy by letting my mouth burn.  i understand, but i don't agree with his strategy.  be more diligent with the water unless i yell ""allah huakbar!"""
had boneless wings with 2 sauces. mild and sweet barbecue. the sauces were good. the boneless tenders were overcooked. couldn't get my fork in a couple of them. server was good. place is clean. wouldn't go again though. maybe it was just an off day for them.
"i actually want to like buffalo wild wings. some of the food is pretty tasty, especially when you consider it's a chain and it's probably not the highest quality. they have a classic chicken wrap that you can add any of their sauce or dry seasoning to and it's been my favorite the few times i've gone in. this last time, jt and i were at the mall and we wanted to grab a quick lunch. considering we have had decent experiences at the burlington location and once before in the braintree location, we decided to drop in. there is always a solid draft selection as well, so that can be enticing.unfortunately, this past time was just not that great. first, the place was pretty dirty. there was dirt all over the floor, likely tracked in by a patron, but there was no effort by any member of the staff to clean it up. the bar counter was sticky and while the bartender quickly cleared a spot for us, she didn't bother to wipe down the counters. i used a napkin and water to do it myself...and even then...she didn't offer to wipe anything down.the bartender was quite nice and she was quick to place our orders and fill our drinks, but the general lack of cleanliness wasn't comforting.i deviated from my normal order this time and went with a salad with buffalo chicken. it was the saddest salad i have ever seen. the lettuce was limp and past its prime, the shredded carrots were dry and it was altogether unappetizing. i ended up eating the chicken off the top and calling it quits. it was disappointing to say the least."
"currently writing this review as i sit here waiting for the server to come and give the check. the place here is understaffed and the wait is ridiculous for food. first, the server took 15 minutes just to take the order for us. then, we waited close to 45 minutes - an hour for the food to come... server never came back to check on water refills, and we were timing how long it would take for them to give us a check. idk why, but our server seemed to give us attitude for dining in. we felt very uncomfortable and not welcomed... sorry we bothered you by giving you business? food was alright, many flavors to choose from for the wings, just wish our dining experience was better."
"3 star!! 3.5 star for food, 4 star for draft selection and drinks, 2 star for service.this place is located inside the south-shore mall and is a fairly new place. the celtics game days always brings me back to this location- the food is consistently descent and drinks are good but the service is a hit and miss. there has been times where i walked in on a weekend or a game day and got seated within 10 minutes. there has also been times especially sundays where i would walk-in and wait for 20-30 mins to get seated despite empty tables inside. so it all comes down to the staff on shift and how fast are they moving. the food is consistently descent at this location but again be prepared to wait for at least 30 mins after you order. the drinks move fast so we are lucky there. they have a good variety of drafts and a nice selection of margaritas. overall a descent location. i always come back for the good sauces and draft selections and of course the big wide screens on the game days!!"
"so let's say you (or uh...your husband) made homemade chicken noodle soup. it's great the first day, better the second day, but as the third day comes, the noodles start to get sorta soggy , the chicken a bit more chewy....it's still pretty good but meh, i'll be glad when i'm done with this soup for now. this is sort of the same sentiment i have with bdubs any time i go. i kinda get the hate of this place (the franchise in general), but we were fed, and we didn't get sick, so a ok it is :)my husband got the buffalo chicken mac and cheese. he said it was worth the price but could use more flavor. it comes with garlic bread. also lacks flavor but is edible. the buffalo chicken is crispy by the way....this is how a buffalo chicken mac and cheese should be. some make it with grilled chicken. wtf. anyway. i got the parmesan garlic wings (snack size). i don't recommend that flavor. i had to get candy to get the nasty flavor out of my mouth. it's not the fault of the kitchen... i just did not care for it. i'll definitely get something else next time. the wings were cooked well, though... i also got the potato wedges as a side. they were small wedges, but a decent amount came and they were very tasty. my coke wasn't too icy when it was brought to me. some places are ridiculous with ice, so it's iced water with coke flavor. so thankfully this wasn't the case. this place already gets points for being a coke place (i am not a pepsi person)s so giving me a coke that i could enjoy is always nice :pwe were there during the pat's game, so i was surprised we were even served, as they were kicking ass against buffalo and everyone was happy. :)  the cheering even got my son excited. he doesn't even care about the game. he was just happy that people were screaming so it gave him an excuse to scream and clap too. i mean, if you really like wings, this isn't a terrible place. i've been to one of these places a long time ago and they do have decent burgers and other non wingy things. i didn't see anything wrong with this particular location. it's sorta tucked away, but this place is fine. i thought the staff was friendly. the guy who greeted us also greeted my son. if you happen to have young kids, they do have a kid's menu, a booster eat and some high chairs.anyway, tl;dr- typical bdubs, not so bad, just don't get the parm garlic flavor for the sake of your taste buds and breath....nice people, decent food, enjoy."
"way over priced for a chain restaurant serving food on paper plates. lunch for 2 came to $50. i estimate that my side salad was made about a week ago, 50% of which was inedible. i asked for balsamic dressing and was given a blonde colored dressing that looked like and tasted like italian. i asked the waitress if she could swap it and she assured me it was balsamic, which it wasn't. i didn't argue but possibly the labels are messed up in the back and someone should check on them? the wings were decent but i wasn't overly impressed and don't think they were worth the $1 per wing we paid. i'm happy i tried the restaurant out but don't think this place will last long."
"the server that was supposed to help us, helped another table instead and never acknowledged the fact that we sat here and waited for almost 20 minutes just to get our drinks ordered. another server (she was very nice) came and help us. she let us know that our server is ""completely unaware"" that he had customers. i understand that it is a friday night, but it is not an excuse to just ignore your customers. no tip for you!"
well first time having buffalo wild wings and had the take out. was not impressed with the size and portion of the wings  be honest i have see frog legs bigger the sauce was good the mild and honey bbq would not visit again
"skip this place,this location.over 25 min still waiting for a simple order to go. yea its game day..but really? then i see a waiting list for the bar,vip..who the hell woukd brag they get vip at b dubs?rude counter help,juiced security on that lil wayne im bad tip and bogus ass custoners who rudely push and shove.this is a nightmare.#hiremoreonrushdays"
"the food are kinda salty when you decide to add seasoning to it. and even if you add in the mildest sauce, it can be hard to swallow it in. but it's not too bad. great to watch sports though but i'm not a fan of nfl and getting drunk at night. so, meh."
i loved the food.  it has pretty crowed here because is inside the mall or attached to the mall.  it is very good for young school kids to come and eat after school.  we came here and this establishment was filled with young school kids eating by themselves no parents.  i was so surprised how this young grammar school kids carry so much money around with them.   i was very pressed to have gotten my order perfectly as i requested.the service here is not the best or maybe because they have very young kids working in the from and as servers and lack experience.  i had to tell my server to please clear my table he looked at me and walked away.   the young girl in the take out she was snapping left and right. she dropped all the paper cups on the floor and am good lord you are too young to be this angry specially at customers.yes i will always come back because is the closest mall to us in chicago
almost every chicken had a broken bone. wings were fresh but not the greatest. the waiter was very nice and attentive.
worst customer service experience one person can experience. i gave this location the benefit of the doubt the last time i was here but this visit clearly revealed that what they are doing isn't working. what good is it to have people waiting that you can't serve.
ashley who was our waitress was outstanding. she made sure we didn't run out of anything. she kept checking up on us to make sure everything was good. i would come back and ask to be served by her again.
always order for pick up because i know they always crowded. there's time they have my order good but if it's pass 9 they always mess up my order. if feels like they are giving the left overs. all dry and cold
"good wings. a little on the expensive side, but oh well. los of tvs and music if you need that for dinner."
i guess i'll start off by saying the manager andrea is rude had 20 plus guest with me just kept nagging about us waiting in door way which the place is crowded nothing i could have did different couple of friends work they cool as ever customers is what makes your business not the manager
came here super bowl sunday. our waiter was very nice. we ordered the deal they had. two shareable and a large order of wings ($31). i thought it was in a pretty good deal because there was about 30 boneless wings in there and a basket of onion rings and also deep-fried pickles. we enjoyed the atmosphere and game. i highly recommend downloading the blazin rewards program app.
"bad experience customer service! and very racist , instead not much customers around ours and i been sit and waited at table more then  an hour nobody come to take order! very bad bad bad customer service!"
"i called in an order at 4:30 to be picked up at 5:30. when i arrived at 5:30 they said it would be ten more minutes. i had to wait 25 more minutes.  when i spoke to the manager about this his answer was, ""what, did you want us to start cooking it at 4:30? we are busy.""  you have lost my business."
waiters are a bit unprofessional. don't get me wrong not all of them but most of them are. this is the one i typically go to since it's close to my house.
"went in there to place an order to go, unfortunately they shorted me one of my wings:(the wings are not the best tasting, the customer service is ok. sadly if your ever in the mood for wings i'd say to try elsewhere."
horrible! waitress charged me like $20 dollars more  than what i was suppose to pay. lady seemed very overwhelmed... don't bite off more than you can chew.
i have been going to the chicago ridge location for quite some time now..but yesterday was the worse..so now they have no more specials on traditional wings just boneless and i love traditional wings...its buy one get one free on boneless and you can only choose one sauce for them no more mixing sauces..the waitress didn't seem like she wanted to be there she was not very friendly at all. she checked on our table once. it took over 30 mins for my food my kids started to get very upset because they were hungry and tired of waiting. the manager did come over and talk with us and took something off the bill that was probably the best part of the night. i will no longer visit this location again.
"horrible service,  horrible wings.  i ordered boneless wings.  i had more breading then chicken on each wing.  come to find out they are pre-breaded from an outside source.   by watching their commercials makes it seem like they bread them there."
"we decided to eat here because it's decent for little kids (6, 5, and two that are 18 months old).  the food was okay.  the service was terrible.  we had to continuously ask for everything.  we had to ask for silverware, water, refills on the waters, and even the check.  when we were ready to pay, we couldn't find our waitress and had to ask another employee to run everything for us.  possible the worst part though is the overall cleanliness of the restaurant.  the tables were sticky and the highchairs had left over food all over them.  easily one of the worst experiences that i've had at this ""family"" restaurant."
great service and the food is always good. the only downside is that it is usually packed and you have to be 21 after 10pm inside.
visit here often with my family and always have a nice experience. staff is always friendly and i appreciate the managers checking in once the food is delivered to ensure everything tastes good! will continue to visit here for lunch/dinner!
coming here on the weekends for a dinner is probably not a good  idea unless you're ok with 30to 45 min  wait to sit the loud noises and the crowds. i usually like coming here but saturday night we were there is just disappointing. there are probably 30 people waiting in the area i would say including the teenagers sitting on the long bench. but then luckily theres a space in the bar 4 more chairs empty we had no choice but to just eat in the bar. buffalo wild wings is a good place dont get me wrong but we probably went on the wrong day and time. the food is fantastic the service is perfect the people at the bar are very nice. and we actually did like  sitting in the bar coz that way we dont have to wait for servers. we got everything covered out sitting in the bar.
"the invisible menstanding out from the crowd is something i do fairly well.....except for this past weekend with my buddy jason k.i come to this b-dubs quite often, at least once every other week for dining in or pickup.  these guys have always been punctual, polite, and the quality of stuff leaving the kitchen has never come into question.unfortunately, after we got seated shortly after noon on a saturday they straight up forgot about us.  no one came to greet us or take our drink/food order for a solid quarter hour which really bothered me.i'm the type of person that won't tell you your mistake right away; i'll hold my tongue and give you time to rectify it.  eventually a server wearing a green tutu (don't ask) stopped and asked if we'd been helped yet.....only took 20 minutes, sheesh.food was fine.  jason dug his burger and my cheese sampler was worthy of a triple-bypass surgery.  it came with mozza stix, cheese curds (delish) and a grilled cheese sandwich dusted with magical seasoning.  made solid leftovers, too.bread = 4.5circuses = 3i'll still come back here because the alternative is either wingstop (meh) or the berwyn b-dubs which is an absolute dumpsterfire.  so i'll ding elmhurst a full star for the lack of timely service but historically they've been a-ok.  i'll come back."
"thursday night is boneless thursday, i get it , it's busy, but come on.... can we get some good staffing? i place an order over the phone , 50 minutes i pick it up and the girl who took my call tells me she never took a call with my number while i'm staring at our 1min and 6second phone call on my phone . i ask to speak to a manager as i walk back to my car , i am on hold for 8min just for them to tell me ""we have your order we didn't hear the name correctly"" so after an hour from when i first place the order to them finding my order i get cold wings and the girl who took my phone call is nowhere to be found , no manager to talk to all i have is 10 servers at the front desk thinking about saturday nights party. thanks for my cold wings . katie was the on duty manager but could not come and talk to an upset customer for her bad customer service and staffing."
"slow service, dirty and unkempt. i've been to other buffalo wild wings that was clean and promptly served. elmhurst one is altogether something else."
i have my gripes with consistency at buffalo wild wings but i will say this location is consistent with the quality of their fold.
"placed an order for a snack size boneless (8 wings) then they told me they had a special on tuesdays bogo any size boneless so i ordered 2 snack size. when i got home i opened up my wings to find that they gave me 16 wings instead of 8, in each order of snack size! so we had like 35 wings when we only ordered 2 snack sizes which should have been 16 wings and they gave us like 8 ranches! food was ready and fresh when i picked it up! we had a great dinner thank you guys :)"
"i've always had great service at this location. not sure his name, but the bartender who tends to work friday nights is awesome"
"had a great time here last night watching all the games. sunday night football along with the cubs vs dodgers game. there was not anywhere you could look that didn't have some type of game on. we had great service and a great time! our server was training so she had a trainee under her as well. he was prompt and always ready to clean the unused or old dishes off the table. they weren't overbearing or annoying at all, in my opinion, it was just the right amount of checking in.we ordered a round of beers before ordering an appetizer (chicken quesadilla, which was delish) and then followed up with a few more beers, and then a small (12 piece) of boneless wings. we couldn't leave without ordering the wings because another table had ordered them and they smelled so appetizing! i'm a huge fan of the asian zing, it's not too spicy but it's just the right amount *must use ranch or blue cheese for just the right amount of spice. we were there between 3-4 hours and never felt rushed or like we were hurting their table turnover profit. five stars in my book!"
we went on valentines day and asked for a booth since i had my newborn with me. the girl said it was going to take about 15mins to be seated. as we waited there was a bunch of people coming in and being seated before us. we asked the girl if we were going to be next she said couple more mins... it's been 30mins now. as we seat down to wait my boyfriend notice a couple that went in after us have been placed in a booth! like really? then of course waiting for a waiter is freaking horrible! we didn't look at the menu since we knew what we wanted. they didn't give no napkins when our food was ready and my boyfriend asked for two ranch they forgot. waited forever for refills... had to ask manager. that's why i don't come here no more. bad service over all
"this place is sheisty as hell. my boyfriend and i ordered for a pick up almost $30 worth of food. the person i was on the phone with told us that it will take 20 minutes for it to be ready. we got there in ten minutes and the food was already done. i was like ""hell yeah! they work fast!"" thinking they were piping hot. when we got home, fries were dry and stain af, and the wings were cold. imagine if we did end up coming in 20 minutes. smh. the manager there was bogus too! telling us that we can come back and they can remake the food for us. do you really think we would want to drive back and forth just for this shit? and she wasn't willing to refund us until i went off on her, then she told me she could do a transaction by giving me back my $6 in my card since i paid $20 in cash. she thought my ass won't get my $20 back."
"chicken here was chewy, although i specifically added a comment for ""crispy"". by chewy i mean it was not well-cooked. great way to ruin your appetite :("
"why don't they have tuesday sale after 8pm, for taco tuesday.  i don't get why i have to go somewhere else for this special. they said that this sale ends at 8pm wtf!i have to go to north riverside, il.  to enjoy wings.  i don't get it. don't have a promotion if type not gong to obey by it.  just don't have specials"
buffalo wild wings is always one of my favorites! this time i ordered pick up! i ordered the chili con queso cheese dip with no chili or pico de gallo & i always like asking for extra cheese just because this is honestly the best queso cheese dip ever. my only problem was they didn't give me extra cheese but it was great either way.
"my girlfriend and i decided to visit this buffalo wild wings location on a saturday afternoon around 1pm. we were greeted kindly, and were sat immediately. our server (ashley?) was very friendly and prompt with service. our orders were delivered quickly and as expected, tastey! we used a $5 off coupon which our server took off of our bill without any issues at all. overall, this meal was very good!our only complaint would be the temperature of the dining area; it was quite cold, to the point of being uncomforting.i hope this review can encourage others to visit this buffalo wild wings location despite the previous ""not-so-encouraging"" reviews that have been written."
one star and that is being gracious! let's start with the establishment dirty and not clean!! tv's hanging had enough dust on them that you should worry about it falling off and onto your food at the table. second the prices are so-so for wings that are basically fried and then i'm sure some guy in the kitchen who thinks he is a chef just pours sauce over them and rolls them in it before sending them to your table. wings did not taste fresh and were terrible. there was too much sauce on the chicken that you couldn't even taste the chicken. the crowd not my type! if you bring your kids out to eat and they are coughing and wheezing at least have the audacity to have them cover their mouths! your a parent and gang banger then have the decency to dress like a parent not a scum bag! at this point a call to the elmhurst health dept needs to be made. i will not go back!
"not mad, but very disappointed in the service. our nachos took way longer than they should have and there was way too much chili and cheese heaped on them, and my garlic parmesan wings were drenched in sauce. it was just lazy work on behalf of the kitchen staff. the wait staff seemed more concerned with hanging out than serving the guests, i refilled my own drink after unsuccessfully trying to wave down two different servers. but yeah, i usually love bwws. but not tonight."
"always fast service, friendly staff and the wings are always perfect! have been to several other locations and this is my favorite and the place is always super clean."
"service was horrible.  i ordered a buffalo chicken wrap.  and the guy comes out with buffalo chicken sandwich. so he brings it back after i mentioned i wanted a buffalo chicken wrap again. second time,  he comes out with a chicken wrap,  hardly any chicken in it and no buffalo sauce. he didnt charge me for my meal,  but the manager didnt even come up and apologize for the inconvenience. i've been going to this bww for years,  and i have never had such horrible experience before."
"i can't say i'm a huge fan of bww, the place is very loud and i think it's a bit expensive for the quality of the food you receive.  however, what bww has (that you cannot find anyplace else in elmhurst) is the hottest freakin' sauces.  i'm a huge fan of spicy food and i was pleasantly surprised when they offered a new ghost pepper hot sauce.  and, unlike some of their sauces, this one actually tastes good.  i'm leaving myself a reminder here to take it easy.  i almost over did it this time ... fortunately the endorphins kicked in big time!    as of this writing there are ninety-six restaurants in elmhurst.  i plan on eating at, and reviewing, every one.  follow me on yelp!"
"buffalo wild wings has great wings, but otherwise the rest of the menu is just so-so.  tonight the service was awful.  as soon as we told our server we only wanted water, we were pretty much ignored for our entire visit, and the server gave us the absolute minimum of service.it took over 10 minutes for her to bring us our water, and take our orders. my son ordered the mac & cheese with milk.  he also asked if he could have the milk warmed.  the server wasn't sure they could do that.  she suggested she could give him a cup of hot water, and he could put the cup of milk in the hot water to warm it.....my wife ordered traditional chicken wings with carrots and i ordered boneless wings with celery.  the wings were delicious.  the carrots did not look at all appetizing. when i asked the manager about it, he explained that they get bags of dry carrots and soak them in water before serving.  our carrots just hadn't soaked as long as some carrots.  a longer soaking would have made them look better, apparently.finally, we asked for our check and again it took over 10 minutes to get our check."
"service was poor like all the other reviews say. i went with a friend and niece. asked for her water and my water with no ice and we had confirmed our drinks before she left and still brought her water with ice (no biggie). i asked for my sandwich to have jalapeños in it, and it came without it. then when she came back, i asked if i can get jalapeños on the side now and she said okay but brought back the jalapeños when i had 1/4 of my sandwich left (still charged us). she asked if i wanted anything else and i asked for some tartar sauce on the side, and she said i'll bring it right now and i never got that. anyways, fish sandwich combo was $12 and it was average (mcdonald's is better). my friend got the sweet shrimp dish which was also $12 with no sides and thought it was just okay."
"this establishment is bigger, brighter, and cleaner than the average bww. we were seated immediately on a tuesday at 7pm, when the restaurant was at about 80% capacity. our waitress was new but she got our order correct, and food was served in about 10 minutes. the mango habanero traditional wings were slightly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and our fries dusted with chipotle bbq flavor came out as expected.overall, the service and quality was the same (if not better) than other bwws. judging from the other reviews, this place either has some consistency issues or recently got much better at service. i would come again."
"i like this location, it's very clean and the staff is quick to fill online orders. i placed an order for a few baskets of wings and fries, and it was ready to go by the time i got there. as always, it was delicious!definitely try the asian zing!"
dirty bathroom. dirty bar. no management. dirty dishes left all over bar. what's going on here?
"so far the slowest service ever. looks like they have more than enough employees but it took over 20 minutes for a waitress to come see us. if i didn't stand and approach one of the staff, no one would have come seen us. as much as i like the food, service here makes me want to avoid this place totally."
"very poor service. went in with my family of 3 and waited for a few mins till a hostess showed up. then a family of 4 was behind us, and the hostess told us that they were cleaning a booth for us, while the hostess then seated the family of 4 to a table that was clean. didn't really understand why they had to clean a booth when clearly there were many clean tables. after we had been seated, we waited for a waiter to come give us a menu or greet us or anything, but nothing at all. just one of the workers who decided to leave some napkins and straws and silverware and that was it. my family and i decided to wait for 15mins to see if anyone would attend us. and nothing, so we decided to leave."
"very bad service , waiters seemed in a rush to just get back and chit chat with each other . food quality was not that great , the wings were really salty . they servers spoke with an attitude and got irritated if you asked for something and i asked for a cup of water took forever to get and the store wasn't even busy . honestly i wouldn't recommend service here sucks and i don't trust eating at a place with service that isn't top notch and waiters seem so distracted with one another only ."
omg this korean bbq flavor!! i hope it's here to stay; not spicy but bits of chili flakes enveloped in a sticky sweet sauce.
usually bbw has pretty iffy service. but this one was great the waiter was super prompt and the food came out at a reasonable time. normally it takes an incredible amount of time to get your food but this was perfect. naturally the asian zing and garlic parmesan sauces were delicious. and fries super tasty.
"the worst ever buffalo wild wings on earth or lets say the universe.i cannot believe the fact that they actually have the audacity of running business with these kind of ethics they got which we experienced of pure negligence and ignorance totaling 45 plus minutes of wait for somebody to come ask us for drinks or even hand out the menus after being assigned a spot to sit on a weekday with pretty much 80 percent of restaurant being empty at the time me and my family went and even after getting an attention of a server just walking by we were not handed out menus neither nobody again came to our table after we sat down it all looked very unreal because a party of 6 men came in front of us and they were treated the way anyone should expect to be treated when they go to a restaurant handed out menus got drinks gotten their orders took and stuff yet again the girl that was suppose to be our server walks by and again when i waved at her she came a little closer to the table and asked ""oh so you are trying to order""?hold on i will be back in a few ,well guess what we waited for her because not that we now wanted to eat just so we can now actually let her know how pathetic this all is and we are leaving without even ordering a glass of water i am glad we walked right out after she came and we told her we are leaving because this is unacceptable which we did and i took my family right out of the restaurant and nobody even tried apologizing including the lady manager they have who was aware of us being treated like that i saw her rolling her eyes when our suppose to be server walked to her and told her something about us being upset because she thinks we are just sitting here trying to bother servers walking by or some made up story saying we didn't wanna order and all of that but how dumb can they be ? they didn't even give us the menus so how the heck would we order? well never ever again we are going to this buffalo wild wings location no matter how much we crave or no matter how far the other one is i will never step a foot even close to this location going inside of this restaurant is way out of question !  bye buffalo wild wings old orchard! you suck big time i hope you guys close down because the staff you have got some serious issues or are trained to be top notch racists thats all i can say otherwise this review would be a little lengthier if i brought up the racism issue which was a clear signal when we were there so lets just forget about it and lemme walk away by just hoping you would fix this at your restaurant one day in future."
"walked in and waited 10 minutes to be seated. no one acknowledged me or even paid attention. i even spoke out loud and said ""does anyone work here?"" don't know if it's the color of my skin or the way i look. i nodded heads with 2 different families eating there and i wasn't even greeted by 1 employee. what a joke. complete waste of time! let's take a guess to see if i'm coming back here......"
"rubber chicken.  this place is the definition of ""blah"".  the staff is fine and there are a lot of tv's, but it is just so mediocre and overpriced for what it is.  there are so many other places i would go before coming back here.  blah!"
"our server was great, however the host and food runner seemed less than thrilled when communicating with me and my party. despite the lack of enthusiasm, our host was still very polite and accommodating to us and our server was very friendly and definitely did her job and did it right. one of my friends ordered a batch of traditional wings and received a split order, one with seasonings the other without. when we brought this to our food runner's attention he took it back and returned it with the wings half seasoned. this is apparently not the first complaint the server received regarding the quality of the wings. overall the establishment looks fine, however the staff needs work."
"don't normally patronize chain restaurants/bar conglomerates but they were open quite late and was extremely close to prior engagement. the service was great, got my pbr in a charming brewery style glass and even had some delicious warm pretzels with queso. unsure if it's a corporate re-branding or just this location but the layout seemed brighter and more open than most of the buffalo wild wings i recall from a misspent youth."
"i remember going to a buffalo wild wings 8 years ago in cali. it was delicious then! now... eh not so much. they discontinued the mango lemonade, they discontinued the chicken curry flat bread. sometimes the wings are drenched in sauce sometimes the wings hardly have any sauce at all."
"if i could give it zero stars i would- i live 5 min from the mall so decided to visit this establishment out of pure convenience instead of the touhy location- big mistake- the hostess took forever to seat a family of 8  that was in front of us- gave them a corner table by the service door which would've clearly congested them in the area so i can see the mother asking to be moved- so that takes another 5 min-meanwhile- two teenage boys are screaming for a table for 6- finally she gets to us and in an agitated matter walks us over to a corner table right in front of the service door- again this restaurant is not crowded and filled with empty tables- why she keeps taking people to this corner i don't understand- i ask if my sister and i can be seated several tables down away from the door and as she walks away under her breath she says ""fine sit your ass over there"" yes- she muttered those words- i spoke with their assistant manager and general manager josh and luis who was polite and understanding and provided me with their regional manager's number- i called and left a voicemail so hope to hear back- i understand that it's in a mall and they hire teenagers but they need to be trained properly and learn how to act under pressure and or to customers even if they feel agitated- i'm in retail and go through many moments when i want to scream- but as a professional you ask for a break and get off the floor- i was appalled but yet not surprised to get this kind of service from here-"
i got take at this bdubs multiple times and have never had a problem. the staff is very friendly and the food always tastes great!
"normally i feel like sports bars are the armpit of places that sell food and drink. i usually rate them below the dingy of a dive bar. on the flip side, i have always respected that they have their place in the pursuit of ruining your diet. you can grab a burger on the fly, and wash it down with a beer. b-dubs will not have many frothy options for the beer snobs, but decent ones. if i'm dragged kicking and screaming, i come here for the boneless hot wings. buffalo wild wings serves everything, not just chicken. i respect them for their diversity of food, and it's all made on a mainstream level.   my first visit to buffalo wild wings was when my sister took me in indianapolis, and she kept calling it b-w3's. when i made it back to illinois, that was the last i'd heard of it until people started calling it b-dubs and i had no freaking idea what they were talking about. that was, until i did a little poking around on this restaurant's history. what was once buffalo wild wings & weck, was now just buffalo wild wings. got it.the most amazing, emasculating and driven force behind the idea that flourished into this wing joint, has its roots in figure skating. as a child james disbrow, co-founder of this establishment, had polio and went into iceskating in order to keep his legs strong. one of his good friends was scott hamilton. just as disbrow was being elected as president into the united states figure skating association, he passed away from brain cancer at the young age of 54. this makes me wonder if i recall seeing the figure skating competitions at this location. if not, in honor of mr. disbrow himself, i can say that is a sport i could honestly get into. i do believe i would finally find the beauty in the madness of flat screen tv's! b-dub's won't mess around with the intensity of their wing sauces. they have it all laid out on the menu. they depict a thermometer going downwards, wings from hell being the hottest, or what they are calling the ""reformulated blazin'."" i won't go there. i'll stick to the mango habañero, thank you. my only complaint would be that i can take the heat, but here you lose the flavor the hotter it gets. i think you should also be aware that it is almost impossible to taste anything following their wings of death. make sure you sample the cheese curds first, and, according to one of my friends, order in them as an appetizer sampler to cut down on cost. the breading over these ""come here and i'll help you forget your day"" morsels has a crispy shell which seems to boost the overall flavor. they come with a dipping sauce that is slightly spicy, creamy, and no doubt, fatty. yum!last, i need to remind first-time visitors that most of these reviews were written while this still relatively-new location was trying to get on its feet. that's not to say that you won't run into a few bad staff members. old orchard is known for the picky shoppers and i can also imagine they find their way through the doors of b-dubs. staff, keep your chin up, i'm part of that struggle too. to the rest of you devout followers, nah nah nah boo boo, i got one of your evanston managers as my retail manager! at first i could smell the hot wings all over him. now i have come to see what the rest of you are missing. sorry, i don't know if my company is letting you have him back any time soon. have faith, diners, and a better attitude. things are going to change for the better!"
"this is probably the worst bww. i went with my partner on a weekday around 6pm. we were asked if we want to sit at the high top tables in the bar area. we said no and asked if it was possible to get a booth. the man said every booth was full and we would have to wait 30+ minutes for a booth. he said he just sat every booth.....we settled for a table and sure enough, i look around and see people leaving from booths. it was pretttyyyy empty. our food was cold and the beer was expired. our waiter was okay. we went because we had a gift card and definitely wouldn't return."
"if you live in the city of chicago downtown, drive up to skokie to this location. it's worth it!clybourne location is terrible. the skokie location is clean, excellent customer service and no skimping on portions. we got a large serving of celery and carrots (compared to the measly 4 pieces at clybourne).great place! we will be back!"
"for drinks, this place is awesome. for some reason, a blue moon here tastes better than a lot of other places. as for the food, i think i ""grew out of it."" let me explain: when i was in high school, i thought this place was the bee's knees. i would come here on a biweekly, even sometimes on a weekly basis, with my friends because i always craved it and i loved that the whole place was full of teenagers. however, now i hate the atmosphere, and it's always so loud and full of obnoxious people. with that being said, i normally come here during the day now, instead of at night. i also don't think their wings are very good anymore... or their fries. their ""cheese fries"" are literally fries with shredded cheese all over them barely melted on. i literally had them take them off of my tab cuz i was disgusted with them. i've recently learned that i hate their boneless wings, but their traditional wings are delicious. i literally had a few pieces of boneless wing that looked like tofu had been sauced and cooked, meaning that my chicken was square and spongy on the inside. idk wtf happened, but it was so gross. after that experience, i only get the bone-in wings, which are very good, but i'm still very wary of this place due to the boneless wings. consequently, i don't really come here much anymore. my go-to is definitely the mango habanero wings. the sauce is amazing and very spicy, so do not get these if you don't want your lips to burn. pricing here is expensive for what you get, so i suggest coming on thursdays (if you like boneless wings) when boneless wings are $0.60 each... you order by multiples of 5. you can also come before 2pm every weekday and their lunch menu is pretty cheap!for the most part, all of the staff is very friendly and young. no one really knows about the different beers they sell, so don't count on them answering any beer questions for you. i also have noticed that the service is better by the bar area than the dining room area, but either way, service is normally pretty slow anywhere you sit.this place isn't always busy, but during any sort of big sporting event, this place gets packed. plan accordingly if you want to watch a game here or if you just want to eat here during a game."
"the female waitstaff are very nice, friendly and attentive. the host...not so much. he barely acknowledged me and then instantly became distracted by another off duty employee coming in after me asking for the schedule. all greeting him and ignoring taking care of seating me. the off duty employee did not care about causing the other staff member to neglect a customer. in fact, he outright encouraged it with his over zealous greetings and insistence of attention being given to him instantly. right now. wanted the upcoming schedule. then the host asked for my name to write it down. i don't know why. there was no line of people and no one else waiting when i came in. the store was not busy as it was 11:45 pm on a monday. then he disappeared without a word and took almost 5 minutes to come back. again. i don't know why. it shouldn't have taken that long to check which of the many tables available was open for me. i can only assume he'd had to stop yet again to chat up another male employee (that he was walking back with and chatting to before coming back to me) in the back section.  way to make a guest feel welcome and important. {extreme sarcasm here}on to the food. my waitress took good notes on exactly how i wanted my wings. there were stickers on each kind to the exact effect i requested. the cooks did not follow them exactly though. the boneless garlic parmesan wings were not extra saucy. they had just enough to almost completely cover them. i confess that's the real reason i said heavy on the sauce. i wanted them completely coated. not just partially as is their wont. the traditional mild came out super saucy but not well done as requested. in fact it said ""crispy"" on one of the wings' stickers for this set. as a friend of mine that likes her wings well done states...""well done is cooked through enough that the veins are melted away."" and in my opinion, the skin should be crispy as that sticker said. not loose and chewy. bleck. the chicken meat on them was cooked enough but with the not crispy skin and veininess, it kinda grossed me out a bit. buffalo chips used to be meaty potatoes. just like i like mine. the reason i became such a fan of the buffalo chips over wedges and fries in the first place. now you have to hunt for a few of them to be thick and potatoey. the rest are almost like regular potato chips. way too thin and fried through.anyhow, regardless of how nice the young ladies serving me where, the experiences i've had the last few times at various bwws, especially the front host of this one and the inconsistent wings, i don't know that i'll keep going back. i used to love this place. especially this location. as the staff were always very attentive and friendly. i suggest you get someone else at the host station as that is the face of your store and you don't want to be considered a rude and inattentive place as he was. bad first impression."
"i know buffalo wild wings is a chain and they are everywhere but this one is close to my heart.  they actually helped out with allowing my wife's charity to raise funds for pediatric brain cancer.  not only did they dedicate space for us but they allowed us to get food and drinks at a discount.outside of allowing us to host charitable events, the servers are usually extremely personable and attentive.  they pay the proper attention to all the dine in folks but not too much where they hover over you.the specials are abundant albeit they are mostly alcoholic beverages.  they have a ton of beers in draft and a slew of others in bottles.in terms of food, they have $0.60 boneless thursdays.love love love this place and always itching to come back with the wife"
the worst service we ordered cheese curds boneless wings the came out cold we told the waitress to send the cheese curds first and they send it to us when we got the check it was a very bad experience we didn't recive silverware. i would give 0 review if i could...
standard bww experience. was glad to see they were playing premier league on the big tvs. service slightly above average. mango habanero wings are still my favorite. onion rings at this location was better than usual.
"this is a standard buffalo wild wings near the best buy in skokie.  there is plenty of parking and the restaurant is rarely crowded.  you can all types of chicken wings and a good variety of sandwiches / wraps.  there are about 13 sauces to choose from with some being very hot!  i like the spicy thai sauce - it had a nice heat but also a tasty curry twist to it. a snack order of boneless wings was 8 pieces, so more than enough for my dinner.  be sure to try the awesome mozzarella sticks as a starter.  they are little sticks of molten cheesy goodness!  the only drawback is they only have pepsi products.the main reason i like this location is tuesday kids night.  they have $1.99 kids meals complete with ice cream.  this is a tremendous deal as dinner for a family of 4 is under $30!  the have a talented balloon artist walking around and entertaining the children.  the staff is very attentive and gets the meals out quickly so young children don't have time to get cranky."
"it used to be good but not anymore. if you like your food reheated in the microwave you'll love this place. the fries with cheese was nasty, your not supposed to microwave food that was previously deep fried. our waiter told us we need to tell them you want fresh food when ordering, and said the cook is lazy. is there a manager at this place? probably. obviously nobody at this place cares. out of business soon. super disgusting."
"my husband and son's favorite place to dine at on tuesday's! buffalo wild wings can be pretty pricy which is why we take advantage on tuesdays since they have 50cent wings. my son and husband usually get the mild traditional wings and i go for the much hotter ones, mango habanero. the mango habanero will have your mouth on fire! they are sweet, tangy and spicy! we also ordered margaritas. they were on the weak side however and they have more nice than liquid. i'd say skip it and go for a beer. the service was great. the waitress seemed to be training someone because she had someone shadowing her the entire time. they were both very helpful and took care of our table well."
"i am not that impressed with bww but then again why should i be? i have never heard of any one say how amazing the food is, how great the beers are or wow the decor is so creative. the wings are not bad but that's as far as the good words go. why are there 20 plus beers on tap but none of them call me. there is no reason the line up should have miller lite, coors lite, bud and bud light at the same time. one of them should do. they need to fire their distributor, just saying. and one more advice. the staff should really pick up a broom every so often. it is very dirty here."
this location wasn't quite as good as others i've been to. the wings were not sauced very well and seemed to be dry/old. my beer was a short pour and they had a few issues with the kegs in back so it took a long time to get a refill. i usually have a great time at bww's but this visit left more to be desired.
"they service is typically good, the food is typically good, but i feel like bww is just getting more and more over priced. the wings are some time small, and they are not giver equal number of drumsticks and ""wings"""
"multiple disappointing experience from carry out food. most of the time they will forget sauces ( for which we always pay extra) and today i ordered chocolate fudge cake. please have a look on the cake which came in ice cream cup , all smashed , no ice cream with that. i wonder how they expect people to come back again after these multiple blunders. once can be a mistake but repeated bad service is sign of poor management and lack of efficient staff."
"awesome restaurant! stay with me here. why would i say that? it's for people for the younger generation if you want to be waited on. you get what you pay for, especially if our not going to be tipping you waiters. the staff isn't that knowledgeable on beers, but who can blame them? it's on the menu. it is my favorite bww to go, and i live in chicago. i come for the service and the management care. all other bww have bad service."
"this place is just pure madness. first of all, it's always a wait list. luckily we only waited about ten minutes before we were seated. our table was not ready for us even though we were escorted to the table and there was food on the seat. i asked one of the waitresses to clean it- i mean don't they look before telling people to sit down? i cannot tell you how much food there was under the table from them ""wiping"" the table down. the waitress was nice but you could tell she was swamped with work and was just flying from table to table. anyways, we ordered the appetizers which gives you a choice of four mini appetizers. the chili cheese fries did not taste fresh- the actual meat was cold and the fries were soggy. the artichoke dip was gross too- the dip was dried out- i have a picture where you could tell where we dipped our chips in and how ""fresh"" it should look vs how it looked. i ordered 6 bbq, 6 parmesan and 6 mild traditional wings. the wings were the best part- everything else was basic. it's not quality service. the servers are not attentive- got my second refill as we asked for the check- pretty frustrating."
long long wait for carryout. was told 10 minutes.  not hardly.  workers crowded around kitchen talking and laughing.  no evidence of any manager. mixed up system it seemed.  the wings when i finally got them were chewy and tasteless. not a great place.
"food was fantastic, i really enjoyed the poker game with my new roommate, (sean)our sever did a great job and really enjoyed his help today , loved the desert heat wings :) will be going back !! he asked me if i'm a cubs or socks fan ... lol i'm a houston astros fan i just moved here but still rep we're i'm from"
"i love buffalo wild wings so when a location gets it right, i have to give them props. lately i've had pretty good experiences at this location. there was this one time when the server would barely show up and the food came out dry and almost ""re-heated"" tasting but most of my other times here were pretty spot on.i'm writing a review today cause my experience was awesome! i went in today for the march 13th bogo deal. i ordered it for takeout and the people who helped us out were so great. they answered all our questions, made sure we got everything and were polite and patient about it all. the two taking our order were jeremy and haley. they were super friendly and helpful. haley brought out our food and double checked that everything was as it was supposed to be, one by one. she made sure we got all the sauces we ordered and napkins, silverware etc. the order came out under the 15 mins she estimated which went by super quick! the food was great, wings sauced and cooked to perfection. i tried the shrimp tacos which were good ( a little small), but i'd probably get overall, today's customer service was spot on... i went around 1:00pm on a monday which seems to be a good time haha. i think the one day i had the bad experience was toward the end of the night, so if you are ordering around that time maybe ask for more sauce on your wings in advance."
this spot is a perfect date night spot before or after the movies. customer service is ok. the food came out in good time. will recommend the asian zing.
"buffalo wild wings has been a hit or miss for me when it comes to their hand spun wings whether they are boneless or traditional. i have had occasions when i found the wings absolutely delicious (weird, i know) because they were cooked perfectly. other days, well they are usually overcooked and dry. again, standard tasting when it comes to their wings.nothing mind blowing if you ask me. i was just having a huge craving for some greasy fatty foods that i will regret later.i usually order ahead of time online because it's much more convenient. it usually take 20 minutes tops for my order to be ready. not this case though!yesterday (boneless thursday), was definitely not the greatest attempt on carrying out. my order was ready at 9:20 p.m. i arrived around 9:25 p.m. there was only one gentleman holding down the pickup/carry out. i had about five people ahead of me at this point.just waiting and waiting some more. it was finally my turn. i did not get my food and leave until 9:45 p.m. all that time spent waiting was as much time for any food to be cooked.unfortunately, my wings were warm. ):  i have to say, i may have to find a new wings place that isn't a chain next time to satisfy my cravings."
"this location is notorious for long waits and always being busy!! took a long while to get our food and eventually our check. we ordered boneless wings because we went on a thursday and there was a 70 cent per wing deal. i got honey bbq, garlic parmesan, and medium wings. would definitely recommend those flavors, but i don't think they sauce the wings enough bc some pieces were definitely dry. also ordered alcoholic drinks. a stella in a glass cost over $7!! and i had a bloody mary that was ok, but i wouldn't get it again."
"another place where i do not understand the low reviews.  we sat at the bar and bartender immediately helped us. we ordered traditional wings in spicy garlic and mango habanero sauces, and draft beers. service was attentive and friendly. wings were perfectly cooked and arrived within 15 minutes."
"worst service of any bww i have ever been to.  every time i have gone here or ordered carry out it was either wrong, late or the service was terrible.  avoid the berwyn location and drive to a different bww!"
"not only did we wait almost an hour for our food, the food was horrible, nachos and wings were dry  and the place dirty , by far the worst food  and service i've had in a while. could be the location but i would never come here again ."
my experience at bw3 was a good one. full disclosure though i chose to get there when they first opened as i can clearly see...from their reviews...that once they get busy....it can be something else. i was greeted upon entering and i appeared to be first customer. i got my order to go and it was ready within 15 mins. i actually forgot part of my order and the woman working chased me down to tell me my order was incomplete. i appreciated that as i thought both orders were in the same bag. i ordered the spicy garlic wings which actually were not spicy. or garlicky. the flavor used to be more pronounced. i would definitely have to order a hotter flavor next time. the fried pickles are battered in corn meal and not tempura for those interested. they actually had a hint of spice which i appreciated but i thought it had too much breading.  i did not enjoy the sauce that came with it though. while the experience was pleasant enough...i thought the prices was pretty steep. i literally remember 10 years ago when an order cost half the amount it does now and they had 35 cent wing tuesday. so with that being said i'll probably keep making my own hot wings at home but it's good to know bw3 is a viable option. as long as it's during their off peak hours!
"the restaurant did not send a well-done patty as requested and there were only a few mushrooms and a thin slice of cheese on the burger. more pickles than mushrooms... side of garlic mushrooms small, not really a 'shareable'. the dipping sauce is gross. meh. will not reorder."
"tasty wings but delivery has gone downhill big time. orders are either in bad shape (spilled food, messy bags) or missing items entirely.we called the restaurant and the manager was extremely unhelpful basically saying there was nothing he could do since we ordered through grubhub. clearly these types of delivery errors occur enough where they're not surprised/helpful when it happens."
"fantastic experience. strongly recommended to those who is having a bad day and want to worsen it further and those who want to get annoyed. i placed an order through doordash and except for the side of ranch none got done right.1. wet boneless wings - we will give it dry. since it is raining outside, just show it out for few minutes and make it wet2. side of carrots # 1 - sorry, the chicken ate it3. side of carrots # 2 - we told you, the chicken ate it. don't you see your wings are red?what's more funny is the check list they attached to your order bag to ensure everything is packed as ordered.it is shocking to see this chain have a 2 star rating. wanted to give it a five star, but sorry the chicken ate 4 of those stars :)"
"every time i come to this location something goes wrong. one time they were out of boneless chicken, fries and some appetizers. then, on my last visit our waitress actually argued with my friend about what was ordered. stating her order was wrong because ""that's what she said."" really goes against the customer is always right thing. she then charged my friend extra for the order mess up after not fixing it! we were both incredibly frustrated."
"got seated in less than 2 min. server approached us within 2-4 min. ordered immediately. waited an hour for one basket of traditional wings and a basket of wedges. multiple tables all around us that haven't been cleaned off....but they make sure they take their tips off the tables!wings and potato wedges were good. but next time, if i do decide to come back for the wings, i'll be sure to come on a semi-full stomach. because my order will most likely arrive by the time i get hungry again."
"do not order delivery from here! we placed an order, and 2 1/2 hours later we canceled our order because it still hadn't arrived!! unbelievably poor service."
"first when we ordered i asked for my drink while waiting , and had ask for it a second time because they said they forgot. then we waited half an hour for carry out and asked what was happening with our order and was told it was sitting there ready to go. they never said it was ready. when i checked the time on the receipt it was ready in ten minutes, so our food sat for twenty minutes because of their incompetence. i hate to give them one star, they don't deserve that high of a rating."
i believe ive made made a review about this place before saying this is a great place to get bad service. well i tried making a pick up order and they sucked at that too. i called on my way out of work to order for pick up and my job is about 12 minutes away so i figured it would work out. i was on hold the whole drive there and even had myself on hold as i ordered at the location. this is a pretty funny fail. i'm going to record it next time on my go pro and post it to youtube! ;p keep an eye on giothedude on youtube. damn i forgot to put the photo of the call...
"i love buffalo wild wings but this place constantly messes up my order. two weeks in a row they gave me the wrong thing. last week they gave me boned instead of boneless, and instead of mango bbq they gave me mango habanero. my mouth was on fire!  this week they gave me the wrong sauce again and were arguing with me. they brought out a taster of the sauce and tried to claim it was the same as what they put on the returned wings, but it was sweet and tangy whereas the returned wings were spicy. definitely not the same. they did replace them with the correct item after that, though. i really hope they improve things because it's convenient and delicious. it's just really annoying to have to double-check their work to get what i ordered every single time."
"tasty, but some of the worst service i've had from a chain restaurant. the workers only seem like they're interested in turning tables, so they barely treat you like a person. but even then, they can sometimes be nowhere to be seen and take forever to even get refills. i'd recommend getting takeout if you want their wings."
i ordered fries for pick up and thy barely gave me any! they're lucky i was home when i saw this. they're obviously rushing an order. not worth $7.
"dirty place. came in and they weren't busy but still took long for everything!!!!! wanted to order fries after they brought our food but the waiter said it'll take more than 15 min, because the kitchen was a mess!!!!! he kept disappearing. not worth it!!!!!!!!!"
"we called for a carry out order and the lady working at the carry out counter was highly rude, rushed us and did not review out entire order with us. we felt that she did not want to help us in the least and ended up without any celery, ranch, blue cheese or carrots for the child's naked tenders meal along with no milk. our pretzel was quite hard and the wings had hardly any sauce. the woman at the counter was highly rude and made us feel like all she wanted was for us to get the hell out. also, we were not asked for our blazing rewards info which i was fine with because i can use the receipt, but come to find out once i entered the info, it told me that the receipt info was already used for rewards. so i'm not sure if this location is holding on to large receipts to redeem for themselves but i was not happy considering we spent $50.  i will never return to this location. i know it was new year's eve, but having some class never killed anybody."
"i've grown to love this location...many times before i've come here and haven't had a successful experience with either take out or dining in, but things have definitely changed for the better. especially the process of placing orders through the b-dubs app and then arriving at the pick up counter only to find that the promised time of is pretty spot on. i definitely will be coming back, and will continue to be a frequent customer of this location. thanks buffalo wild wings berwyn!!"
i've gone here a few times and service was pretty okay. today was terrible. i don't want to be hunting down the waitress every time i need something. order was wrong. everyone just seemed to be careless about everything. the management at this location really needs to get their act together. i will be making the drive to a better location.
who y'all get mad lmfaomiss all those gorgeous ass females at the food pick up spot lmaoooo better then at the club son
"i have given this bdubs 4 chances despite what everyone says about this location. and i wish i hadn't because it's the worst and extremely disappointing. every single time i ask for a appetizer, i expect it to come before my food, but at times the server will ask me if i want it before or with my food and i always always say before, loud and clear. not once has it came out before my food, and the food comes out in 30 minutes every time. 3/4 times i have came i never get greeted right away, whether by the host or our server. today my group and i sat in a corner booth in the back right, waited 15 minutes for our server to show up, we had no water no utensils only menus. we managed to flag down another server and asked if we can get service, and after waiting 5 more minutes we just got up and left because by then it was just embarrassing. never coming back to this place."
service was terriblethey had servers walking around just chatting while our drinks where missing our server was rude and never checked up on usnever coming back !
every time i come in to eat with my fiancé it is empty. we always have to wait a very long at the host table and no one ever bats an eye to help (those cleaning lobby). crap service when i do get a table. ghetto. go to skokie.
"want to make it known that the day i came here it was not busy at all, just to give a little context up front.came here about a month ago with my girlfriend one evening on a weekday and we asked if we could sit outside. before we were seated, we were told that it was a 20 minute wait- no big deal we were in no rush. when we were seated we ordered the sampler- nachos, 6 wings, fried pickles and mozzarella sticks. our waitress goes back inside and we do not see her for about another 30 minutes. finally the host comes outside and drops our food off to our table, says our waitress will be right out and before we could even ask for anything else she hurried back into the door and here's where it all falls apart...firstly- everything was cold as if our plate had been left sitting out before being brought to us. our spicy garlic wings had little to no sauce. the fried pickles were not cooked fully and there was still soggy batter in the middle of them. the nachos were a mess, it looked like someone just dumped a bag of chips on our plate. you can already assume what i'm going to say about the mozzarella sticks.our waitress was great, but everything else... not so much.conveniently placed, lackidaisically run."
this place is whack. and usually it isn't igor take out and ordered large traditional wings which is supposed to give you 20 wins. guess what i only got 15 and i live pretty far away from this place so i called in and ihope to get a refund or something. the wings weren't even saucy didn't get any ranch what so everthe celery and carrots were super dry and looked like they were sitting out for a week or 2 very bad experiencei really love buffalo wild wings and this disappoints me very much my favorite restaurant messing up. big time. i hope to get something i lost 5 wings in this
the boneless wings were dry and retried very hard in texture...barely any sauce on the wings.this wasn't what i expected and i know they can do much better.
"where do i start? we placed a pickup order late saturday night. i ordered a buffalo chicken salad, without onions and with ranch. my fiancé ordered asian zing wings with ranch. when he came home with the order we realized our order wasn't correct. my salad had onions. look at the attached photos. you can clearly see the receipt where it says no onions. i also requested ranch and got the blue cheese anyway. ugh! what's the point of modifying my dinner if you're going to give it to me however you'd like anyway. and his ranch was just like a drip drop. i mean this order was like 40 bucks? we can't get 4 oz of ranch? that's ridiculous. he ordered a medium size btw. i live a block away so it made life easier but honestly i rather drive to skokie and pickup there!!"
"this place is terrible. they are understaffed which i hope explains why the service is horrible. we sat at our table for twenty minutes with no waiter in sight. the food took almost an hour to come, we ordered a small and medium wing. the order was wrong, we never got the mozzarella sticks we order as an appetizer. our waiter never came back to our table i had to flag him down. the wings had clearly been sitting under a food light to keep them warm. the fries were cold. this was a terrible experience and food the food is awful. do not waste your money or time."
"well.. this place just plain ol sucked. service is horrible, dirty and not worth loosing your hearing for... now i remember why i never come to this place.. meh."
the friends and wings were cold when my delivery arrived nasty to eat ! just because we order for delivery we expect the food good not dry ! p.s the place it's 5 min away !
"fast service, polite , and affordable . location was clean . will not mine returning ."
"we're officially regulars and they know our order. i think they hate to see us coming. nevertheless, the service has improved some...probably because they think we are a pain in the ass. trust me, we don't have that many options that late at night, otherwise we would be someplace else. i really like 1 black female manager she takes care of us. there is this other hispanic young guy and a young black guy. these ppl rock! glad they are getting better."
"david was a really good server. my food came out pretty quickly, it was hot and it taste good. the reviews made me extremely skeptical to the point where i almost left, but i'm glad i didn't. my bill was inexpensive and david was really nice. i will come back again."
"this place is pretty bad with waitress service, i normally tip 20%  but when the waitress gives you attitude because you ask for napkins and a fork and doesn't check up on you when we waited for a check yeah you bet i won't return."
"if i could give 0 stars, i most definitely would. on the 2nd of this month, i placed an order for 2 sandwiches and a wrap. the wrap was only mine, and i made sure to specify that i was allergic to tomatoes and made sure that the waitress read the order back to me, this was placed via phone call. when i arrived, i picked up my order, and saw that on the receipt it also said no tomatoes so i was assured. as soon as i got home, i took a bite into my wrap, and there was tomatoes. i automatically spit out the food but my allergy to tomatoes is so bad that i unfortunately spent the whole night puking and ended up in the emergency room for about 4 hours extracting the tomatoes from my system. outraged by the whole situation, my boyfriend called in and spoke to the manager marc. marc was very concerned and told us that he would accommodate us in any way that we wanted, whether it be a gift card, or the order of another meal, regardless he mentioned ""whatever you'd like we will definitely go to extremes for you."" at the time we called back to let them know about their error, it was 10 minutes to closing so marc mentioned to call back tomorrow once we thought of a way they could accommodate us. the next night, my boyfriend and i decided we wanted to eat there again.. regardless of the situation we did enjoy eating there previously and with how apologetic marc was we decided we'd give them another try. i then called and was transferred to a manager named george. george was the most unprofessional, uncaring, unapologetic manager i have ever dealt with in my entire life. i began to tell him my situation, to which he interrupted me right in the middle of my sentence and said ""yeah i know what happened what do you want us to accommodate you with"" so i explained we just wanted to place another order. he then transferred me to the cashier who took my order, i ordered: 2 sandwiches just like i did the other night, and 2 sets of large wings. the cashier told me there was a promotion for a buy one get one so i obviously took advantage of that. after she was done taking my order, i think her name was alicia, who was also completely childish and inappropriate, she added ""they told me you're allergic to tomatoes so how are you ordering sandwiches with tomatoes?"" how is that any of your business first of all? i placed the same order the day you messed it up, and considering the first time i ordered the food wasn't all for me, the situation was the same this time. anyway, we placed the order and they said it was a 30 minute wait. 10 minutes later, we got a call from george who was very aggressive. he again asked me how i'm order sandwiches with tomatoes, and doubled my order? i'm sorry. i spent a whole 5 hours in the emergency room because of a mistake you made and you're going to question me? my boyfriend grabbed the phone and began talking to him in a nonchalant tone, to which george began screaming, saying that we're ""scamming them for more food"" ""i'm probably not even allergic to tomatoes"" .. my boyfriend then told him that he'll be hearing from our lawyers which they will. i wouldn't be going through all of this trouble for some food, it's more about the principal and accommodating for the mistakes that were made. he mentioned how the bill was 2x as much, and how marc said he would only cut the check if it was the exact same order but that was never mentioned. he went on and on about how much trouble he could get into if he comped our bill, but i guess he's not considering how much trouble he's going to get into with a lawsuit. george is by far the most unintelligent, inexperienced, rude manager i have ever came into contact with, as well as his cashier or whatever she is. aside from that whole situation, the club itself is a mess. as soon as you walk in, there is never a host at the host stand. you usually have to wait 5 minutes for someone to even notice you're there. improper music is always playing. a bunch of curse words that aren't even blocked out, and there's always children in there so why is that music even allowed? the club is also very dirty, and many of the employees are rude and seem like they don't want to work there. i definitely wouldn't recommend this club to anyone, by far the worst buffalo wild wings location.  my boyfriend and i made sure to make facebook statuses, and let all of our friends and family know about the situation that happened and whoever we told agreed that the club was by far the worst. do yourself a favor and save a headache, don't eat here."
service sucks here. they take a while to come and take your order. food is very pricey and sometimes it comes out cold!! only thing that are good there are the cheese curds. other than that is not really worth coming here.
"worst location ever. took us 20 min to get sitted, when all the tables are literally empty, server jabari arrives right away without even say hi, or how are u at least. nothing!!just are u ready to order?? dude we just got here relax, we order drinks, he comes back with the drinks, we order food, someone else brings the food out, we run out of ketchup by now we are looking everywhere to see if we can see him he is literally gone for 10 min, finally he comes to the table ask him for ketchup, water and more habanero sauce because wings were super dry, he never came back with does 3 things until we were finish with food. took another 5 min to bring a box for the leftovers. dude if you really hate your job lazy ass, start by looking for something else. and i still tip his lazy ass 15% because i know u work for tips, and my husband worked for tips too in the past."
"my sandwich was sloppy, the fries were missing, and my food was not warm (the restaurant is only 10 minutes away). when i called the restaurant, they did not acknowledge my issue and placed me on hold for so long that i hung up. i contacted grubhub instead. they were on hold with the restaurant for so long that they offered to resolve the issue with me directly. although i will continue using grubhub, i will never order buffalo wild wings again."
we get there one hour before they close and we get seated. no one waits on us. finally the hostess or manager or whoever she was ask us if we have been waited on and we reply no so she goes to the group of waiters that are huddled in the front chit chatting and begs them to help us and one agrees and heads over. he also makes it a point to tell us how no one else wanted to help us but he said he guess he'd do it! anyways we order a beer and myself a drink and he comes back takes our order. i ordered a pretzel and the dipping cheese was cold and tasted rancid and old. his wings seem fine. then we order another beer and he's like oh the bar is closed. i think he should've mentioned that when we ordered our drinks but ok whatever. very disappointed. the music was good.
"waited 5-10 min for a table on a friday at 6pm. our server, jameson, was quick and attentive. we ordered 3 snack size wings and a ""basket"" of fries which didn't come in a basket and were likely less fries than i've gotten at other bww locations. food took 25 minutes to arrive which was kind of ridiculous if you think about the quantity.everything tasted good though and we left satisfied. didn't wait long for the check and payment was processed quickly. my expectations were met although they weren't super high to begin with."
"wasn't expecting amazing experience and the host/server who greeted us at the door ensured that. she wasn't at the host stand and when she came back from downstairs said there was a half hour wait. me and my friend had asked her if there were bad tables or bad seats as she was just up there not even a minute ago and she said ""idk ya have to go up and check yourself"" okay thanks for your poor attitude. get a different job. server to server you suck at this gf.                                           shout out to nay upstairs she's been awesome thus far! super welcoming unlike the other one. go bears!!!"
"it is unbelievable that this place can have such bad customer service. we came in 11:40 with only 6-7 people sitting in the bar area. the server quickly looked at us and said one min. it was 15 mins before he came over and checked in. the high top chairs has sauce on it, if i didn't notice my fiancée white dress would be ruined. the utensils were dirty as well. the wait time for the food was ridiculous as well, we had to ask 2 time to see what was going on with the order. for nachos, wings and fries it shouldn't take 40 mins. compared to other buffalo wild wings, this place is lacking very much"
"one thing for sure, to me, this place is entirely not serving the best wing in town, nor the best chicken wing chain ever. however, it is a pretty ideal place for sports lovers who would love to have some wings and beer while watching a football game or an nba match. t.v.s are everywhere in every way making a customer can easily view more than one television no matter where he sits while still having the wing. we ordered for ourselves some wings with lemon pepper rub and spicy garlic as well as some cheese curds, rings, and fries with a dip of bleu cheese. all of the food had pretty good quality but impress. the wings we had were quite fresh, good texture, crispy outside and juicy inside. overall, this is a right place for hanging out and watching games with friends, but the best place to visit for delicious wings. our waitress did her job pretty good."
"my first time eating at this location so i'll give it a 2 star rating. cons: -service was pretty bad. there was a playoffs game on when we went for dinner. the servers literally waited until commercials to serve food/drinks/anything smh. -my frozen lime margarita was so watery smh. it had zero flavor and tasted like just crushed ice.-they should def validate parking because there are so many restaurants nearby with their own parking lot, idk how they passed up on that.pros:-besides having slow,inconsiderate service, the host and servers were pretty nice and friendly-their food was pretty good, like any other bww i have tried.i'll try it one more time because of the location but according to the past reviews seems like nothing is changing."
"came here with a group of friends for a late night bite to eat. just as the others mentioned, this place is epically slow. even with us sitting at the bar, it was still a drag. we ended up having to go to the upstairs bar because downstairs was packed and we weren't really given a straight answer on when there would be some free space. when we got up to the bar, it was trash everywhere lol i guess the bartender didn't feel like cleaning anything ‍ i went with the shrimp po boy because i was not in the mood for their wings; i'm actually not a huge fan of them. everyone else with me ordered just wings and our order still took forever to come. the sandwich wasn't bad though. that i can't complain about. service, however = terrible!!!!!!"
"while getting a table was fast, our server damon took forever to come and take our order, and when he did come over, he was impatient with us. he didn't give us our wings or refill our waters and would not check up on our table. i decided not to leave a tip because of the poor service and he had the audacity to yell ""thanks for no tip"" as we walked out."
"family football draft but this review is not a fantasy. i give it a 3 only because of the food and a young man by the name of kenny smith who knows how to treat a customer. we were there to do fantasy football some thing that was arranged ahead of time. we arrived  early to find out nothing was ready and three people working at the front entrance were clueless, so eventually they threw something together. we had about 10 or more to our party. maybe i have been spoiled by good service of making sure people have water, asking if all parties need anything, checking on your customers, and seeing if the party would like anything else because you bring them their receipt. let's not forget the manager lorenzo. i kept seeing him standing there watching us i just started looking back at him. he would walk away and 5 minutes or so come back and hold his staring spot. what lorenzo should have been doing was getting someone to clear the table of the empty containers,  apologizing for the service the moment we walked in. buffalo wild wings at this location you need to do better. i really hope this isn't how the other locations  treat the customers"
"after reading the reviews and trying to go in for lunch once to find out that it would take a while to get seated and way longer than expected to get food (i don't think they're used to people only having a half hour or 45 minutes for lunch) i avoided this place for a while but i decided to give it a try on a random weeknight. it was somewhat crowded but i was able to get a seat at the bar, and they got me my drink pretty quickly. i mentioned i was in a hurry and asked about how long it would take for some chicken strips, the bartender/server guessed about 15-20 minutes, and her estimate was spot on - not what i was expecting from the reviews. the food was pretty good too, and while service wasn't that fast when i tried to pay, overall it wasn't a bad experience.i can't say how things went for people at actual tables or in larger groups, but sitting at the bar seemed to work fine."
"i can definitely understand why this place has such horrible reviews. we waited about 10 minutes for a table on a saturday night before we were seated upstairs. our server was the bartender upstairs and she did a decent job considering she was making drinks and taking orders. she came and took our order quickly, but did get pretty frazzled as the night went on. our appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip came out and was completely burnt. after waiting for about ten minutes to get our server's attention she took it back and we got a fresh order that wasn't as bad. the wings were decent and the order came out correct. we ordered a side of fries and those came out separate from our food. we had another wait of about ten minutes to get our check once we finished eating. definitely a hit or miss experience, but i'd come back again to get my craving for bdubs out."
i read all the other reviews and was a little worried it would take forever for our food. we had taquana and she was on top of everything. our drinks were there before they ever ran out. she took our order and brought our food in a timely manner as well. i'm sure with where this location is placed it is very busy but they had people in and out very quickly. we will return here again.
update the general manager called right away to correct this issue and offer an apology. i am sooooooo terribly disappointed in this location. i placed an order yesterday and went immediately to grab it. i literally live less than a mile from this location so how my food was cold is beyond me. but the real issue was that the celery and carrots served with my order were old. super old!!! like needing to be trashed old. they were not edible and were totally disgusting looking. the fries were $5.49 and was not even a full order and were also cold. the only thing edible was the hot wings which were ok but would have been better had they not needed to be reheated. i usually go to the location in new lenox. maybe i will stick to going there where you actually get what you pay for.
"not the best experience. came here on a sunday afternoon. the establishment itself was not too tidy. we had a whole bunch of different people helping us, so we were not even too sure who we could ask for help. the server who took our food/drink order didn't even make eye contact with us and got our order wrong. we were not given drink refills. it was not a good experience. do not plan on coming back to this particular location."
"this was me & the mrs. first time at this location. when me & the mrs. arrived we had to wait on the hostess to arrive to the front, because she was having a personal conversation with another employee. the hostess was unprofessional and she seemed confused.most of the tables & seating areas were not cleaned for the next customer. most of the staff are unprofessional and could be more attentive to the customers.the parmesan garlic wings were ok. i tasted more italian herb than garlic, needed more of a garlic taste.the thai curry wings were to salty for my tastebuds. if it was less salty it would taste goodthe asian zing wings were really good. it had a nice sweet taste with a little zesty flavor to it.the spinach artichoke flatbread pizza with chicken was great. nice size portion that can probably feed 2 to 3 people. i will go back to bdubs, but i'm skeptical about this location."
"the food was sooo horrible!!!  the onion rings tasted like they had been cooked in old recycled grease!  we didn't eat them.  for $9 i expected the waitress to ask me why they were untouched and to offer a refund or substitution.  nope.  not at all.  had to ask several times to have our water glasses refilled.  i normally tip well, but her lack of attentiveness made me leave her a much smaller tip.  i won't be back....not worth it!"
"even though the reviews warned me otherwise i still came to bdubs for some wings cause i was craving them like crazy and tuesdays are half off traditional (bone in) wings. came around 6, wasn't terribly busy. service was fair with no real complaints. food was pretty good and wait time was minimal at about 25 mins to make the wings, appetizers came out in like 10 minutes (as compared to the other reviews). i definitely believe that this place gets really hectic during big games and when people get off work as staff seemed like they were stretched really thin later on at night.they have free parking in the garage on the side for an hour and half with validation. we had to rush in and rush out (cause wings themselves take 25-40 mins to make)."
"i have been craving wings for a long time. haven't been back to bww since a racist incident toward some of my students (at another bw location), so the first thing i noticed was how much the prices have gone up. the next thing i noticed was how extremely rude the cashier at the to-go register was, but i was really craving those wings. i had just attempted to order online, and given a time of 10 minutes til i could pick them up. i worried about getting a parking spot, so decided to order in the store. found a spot right away, so was thinking a 10-minute wait... miss rude said ""25 minutes.""i said ok, cancel that order, i can't wait 25 minutes. it was not crowded at all, a weekday at 3pm, practically empty. she had to call a manager over and he was almost as rude as her. i told the hostess i'd never be back here-- she actually seemed upset and curious, but i didn't want to take the time to explain. as many wing places as there are in chicago-- all cheaper than here i'd guess-- i won't ever have to go back to bww. shame, because before they apparently got rude, racist, and expensive, those were some damn good wings!!"
"worst bww in the entire states. very poor and disrespectful service. the wings were not fresh at at. there is no salad or ranch. the easier didn't even ask if we want any dip. the spinach artichoke dip is generally rich, the one here is so cheap and they came with some cheap chips."
"horrible service, it took 45 minutes to get a simple takeout order. i wouldn't mind, except they told me it would only take 25 minutes."
"tues night,  just 2 of us.  went in for the usual bww 1/2 off traditional wing special. upon walking in,  hostess took a min to figure things out.  there were 3 parties ahead of us.  we still got seated within 2 minutes.  the place was barely half full of customers.  i should've known right then why but.... yeah. it was our 1st time at this location and it turns out this location no longer has that specific special we came in for. (for 2 months now) its what we do every tuesday! its what we look forward to..... and we get a large traditional wing order. mango habanero and asian zing. one star lost for that.  remaining 4 stars goes towards the  delicious food that came out hot and tasty.  and for the phenomenal service from our server audrey. with all the food competition in the area,  they should've kept that special. unfortunately, i will not be back to this location."
"my family loves bww! the hot wing sauce is so delicious. kids meal are pretty fairly priced. it has become kinda pricey. the service is usually a joke. we ordered a large order of wings and no one brought extra napkins, wet wipes, or container to put bones in. we eventually asked for extra napkins. large order of wings only came with 2 carrots and 2 celery.  4 freaking pieces of veggies for a large order.they have really become cheap and skimping on portions."
"i have never had a 100% positive experience at this place, something always goes wrong.  the problem is, i love their food, and keep coming back, but should probably lower my expectations and learn to very explicitly spell out every item that should come with my order, and track down a server on my way to my table.the service here is like they have staffed only snail people.  every time i have ordered something for delivery or pickup, at least one item from my order has been wrong or missing.  boneless wings?  here are some wings with bones.  kids mean with wings and a side?  here are some wings, no side.  a kinds meal always comes with a side.the only thing you can count on here is that their sauce is delicious.  leave your other expectations at the door."
"honestly this buffalo wild wings is so poorly run, it should be shut down and given new management. i have ordered delivery three times from them, and every time my (very simple) order has been messed up so that will be the last time. i am not sure if they are so busy that they throw all corporate practices out the window, but as a former employee at another location, i know they bww is supposed to check orders before they go out the door and they just can't possibly. last time i was picking up my to-go order i had to wait behind 3 people who needed refunds because they had already been there over an hour and were done. i really do like bww food, but this location just cannot get it right."
"to be honest, if bwws didn't have bogo boneless on tuesdays and 99 cent wings on thursdays i would never come.my boyfriend and i have gone on multiple occasions and the service is usually a major miss. the first time we ordered two larges, and the server was emphatic that we only get 2 sauce choices for wings. however, we came back, and a different server told us we get 4. i've never been at this location without seeing at least one table that hasn't been bussed. and sometimes the servers leave it like that.the wings themselves are just ok. not great, and sometimes they mess up our order. just now, i ordered a mix and my boyfriend ordered all flats. i got only drums, and he got a mix. go only for the deals, otherwise it's not worth it."
great food !!!! good beers on tap !! lots of tv's for watching sports of all kinds !!great staff keep up the good work!!
"great friendly staff, cold beer, and great food!  one of my favorite sports bars!  managers were there to make sure we had a great experience!  we will be back again!"
"rick valdez is the dopest guy and the coolest guy i have ever met. rick gives good service & is always positive about his job. he's the reason why i go to this bdubs, in the city!!!"
"absolutely disgusted with this buffalo wild wings. my family and i were at this location today and we waited for our food for over 3 hours! after 3 hours we decided to leave. we have a diabetic man with us and 3 kids and hey didn't even offer complimentary fries or something. this type of ""service"" is unacceptable. to wait over 2 hours is ridiculous. the location is not well prepared and should be shut down. i will never go to this buffalo wild wings again."
"this place can't get it right one bit! i don't understand why i keep brining my dumbass here to eat. i have never written 3 bad reviews for one restaurant so this is my first....i call my order in and whoever takes my order is hard of hearing. i had to repeat myself 7 times to get my order straight. when i get to the restaurant, there is no one to be found. again i started to get really pissed off at myself because i know better than coming here. i wait about 10 minutes and then someone showed up with a nasty attitude. make a long story short, my entire order was wrong! again it was my fault because i know better than to come to this location."
"i've been to this bww dozens of times, and it would be the best one of them, but every now and then, the kitchen is off by a wing or two, and i don't want to be that guy complaining to the waiter about one or two wings. the wait staff is awesome; get the kitchen to count and this bww is rock solid."
"this place can be such a blast, especially to watch a game! they have great deals on wings and drinks. i used to go all the time, and never had a bad meal. i am not big into wings but there is this special apple honey sauce that was so amazing. we wanted the recipe to the sauce so badly. i only ordered salads every time i went because they have the biggest salads and the best price! the grilled chicken in the salad is super tasty and it's pretty healthy. the  honey bbq chicken salad is one of my favorite salads. i will be back at some point! all the sharables look great too."
"decided to come here since i had a taste for chicken.  probably not the best option but i digress.  i was greeted promptly but not served promptly.  i saw a few workers walk pass about 5 minutes before my server emerged from the back area.  i sat in the front area.  nice guy, it wasn't busy not sure why the food was slow.  it's kinda loud there.  the tvs volume was up and the staff were laughing loud.  the food is average, salty, but tasty.  the decor is nice, it was clean."
"my brother and his friend placed our order at 3 pm today. i understand it's super bowl sunday so it's one of the busiest days of the year but that's no excuse for what happened. we were told the food would be ready at 5:40 pm. they got there and were told it would be an additional 45 minutes with no real explanation of why the wait was so long. when we finally got our order, the wings were cold. the fries were stale and cold. it's unacceptable. if you're going to make us wait an extra 45 minutes, at least make sure our food is fresh and hot."
"how is this place still open? the kitchen manager should be fired asap! who's in charge?it's 6pm, on a super bowl sunday, & the restaurant runs out of ""chicken wings!""i thought this place was buffalo wild wings, not buffalo wild. whomever told the employees to stop seating should be terminated as well. very poor management, even worse planning! might as well just close the restaurant and lock the doors. this place is embarrassing."
"standard bww with great wings. service was also good and they put on the game that my partner asked for so that was great too. the bathrooms were also clean and easy to find. unlike a lot of places with similar food, the room was a good volume for conversation. no loud music or anything - just people watching games and occasionally getting excited about them."
"their service is terrible. when you order take out, they have no process surrounding that. i remember the first time i went.i walked in and told the front register i had pickup. they got my cc and i paid for it. i then assumed they would go get it. how wrong i was! they have no process for the register telling somebody that i am here to pick up. so my first time i just assumed they were still making it then unfortunately even though i arrived at their eta. so i waited 20 minutes and then finally said to the register, is somebody getting my food? she said oh yes it is not ready yet, sorry. so i wait 10 more minutes before i have had it and i go ask where i see a worker putting bags into a heating fridge and say is my order going to be ready? she checks and says on wait it's been here the whole time! wow great! even today, now that i know how bad they are, they still don't have a process. if you pay for takeout, nobody tells anybody to grab your order. it boggles my mind how incompetent they service their customers. but i am a veteran now so i know once i pay, i just walk over to another worker and ask them to check if my food is in that heating fridge. it is such a no-brainer thing to do that when somebody comes for pickup, you must tell somebody to grab it and give it to the customer. it should never be on the customer to be proactive and have to demand their food to get it. if you don't know how to navigate their pickup service, good luck getting your food! such bad pick up service. address this issue asap!p.s. they also don't let you order online anymore for deals which is insanely annoying. don't try to hide your deals. bad deals (only snack and small size) and not available online for order. bad combo."
hours say open till 1am tonight. but apparently they close when ever they decide. walked in @1130 and rudely was told they are closed. i said it says you are open till 1 they said we are closed. waste of a drive. i was expecting shit service but i was expecting to be served.
"negative reviews at glance, but great experience. i met with up with a few friend on tuesday for dinner. we enjoy bww and were looking for a great deal. they have the buy one get one deal on tuesdays for boneless. we were sat right away, and our waiter was quick to welcome us and brought us all waters. we were waiting on another friend, but our waiter got us our drinks and did not rush us until our friend came. once he came, the water was on top of it and got his drink.we all ordered boneless wings, a "" small"" as they call it. i believe we got about 10-11 wings. the food came out pretty quickly once ordering. i wish there was a little more sauce on the wings. one of my friends had no sauce on a wing. hence the 4 star review, i wish they sauced better.overall the wings were tasty, the waiter was great! he was attentive, remembered our drinks, and was on top of refills and service. the location has street parking which i found easy to park. there was an elevator so it was accessible. in addition, great place to watch sports."
"b-dub dubs, while ubiquitous and omnipresent it's rare i ever go. last time i believe was on a bad date out in westchester like 8 yrs ago #toobadsosad.this time the company was perfectly awesome and i was the lone soldier *not* getting the wings. my son and gf were ecstatic about their choice and subsequent satisfaction of the wings they ordered...which i can't recall. my ""french dip"" was pretty darn good. so were the chips and salsa which we had to order bc the food was taking so damn long."
"my experience here was super underwhelming. though the wait staff was very friendly, the restaurant was nowhere near full and it took 45 minutes to get an order of chicken fingers. the food was decent, priced fairly moderate. our waiter, again though very friendly, was not super attentive to checking in on us. of course, this by no means was a horrific experience, but i would not willingly choose to come again any time soon."
"decent place for some wings. i used to only go to wingstop. i thought they were good. however after trying bww i became loyal to bww. i go when they have their boneless special. i recommend the garlic parmesan, barbecue, & lemon pepper. this is one of the best locations i've been to. it's clean and loud but not as loud as the others!!!!"
"how much you'll like buffalo wild wings totally depends on your frame of mind. they are what they say they are wings - beer - sports. the pub food is very competent, with a nice selection of sauces and variations. there are dozens of wide screen tvs and the staff is helpful and friendly.  this location is on the first floor of a commercial/residential building. the decor is modern industrial style with the hvac all exposed and all hard surface so it's loud and echoey even when it's half full. prices are moderate to pricey for this type of grub ($3 for a fountain drink?) there's a garage right next door - good news is validated parking is free or discounted; bad news is it's an incredibly long and involved journey to find your way to this location from the garage so pack a lunch.bonus points for easy access to public transit."
"i had a great experience here. bartenders are attentive, wings are not pre-cooked, drinks are good, not seven grand but it's a sports bar. beer pours are great, beer clean glasses, good head and ok temp. there are over 30 tvs so you won't be straining your eyes nor breaking your neck and they play the audio for the most popular game (how that is discerned i don't know).gameday they run a $5 special all day ,the menu is good with drinks (cocktails, beer and pitchers) and food (tacos, chicken sandwich, tots and a sampler - to name a few). there is a parking garage and parking is validated for three hours."
"this bww was in a great area. parking structure near by.  which you can get your parking validated.  we came and out waiter was really nice and shared with us the specials. there was tv's everywhere we were watching the pats loose. everything was great except our waiter got busy and forgot about us.  we asked for refills and extra ranch and took a while. i got my usual wings which are always great.  my cousin ordered an ice cream shake and it took way to long so he did not want it anymore, guess they were waiting for the ice cream to melt so our waiter said.  it was a ok experience.  i think it was just super busy cause of the pat's loosing but it is ok. i do not blame my waiter. he actually hooked us up with some bww reward points."
"this specific buffalo wild wings was impressive! my boyfriend and i go to different ones every week for the deals on tuesday and they're usually a hit or miss, mostly miss, but this one was definitely a hit! our server was incredibly helpful and friendly. on top of that, the food came out quickly and the chicken was actually warm and moist. i was very pleased with the service, quality of food, and speed at this specific buffalo wild wings!"
"i've been here many times, and the reason why i keep going back is because of my cravings for chicken wings.the reason why i give this place three stars is because the wait for food or whatever you ask for is generally long. it can get busy especially on promotion days like bogo free traditional wings on tuesdays (snack or small size) or bogo free boneless wings on thursday (snack or small size). it usually doesn't take long to get seated, but i've waited almost half an hour before until my food came out. as bbw is known for televising sports on their tv's, this location also plays very amplified music. i was shouting at my husband the other day we were here because we could not hear each other, let alone ourselves.i do enjoy their chicken though. i recommend asian zing. parking is free with validation."
"this review is for the fantasy football draft party that my league held here on august 26, 2018. overall the party went really well and we were happy with the level of service and quality of food we received. i originally reached out to bdubs about 3 weeks ago to reserve a spot for our draft party. after several emails and phone calls without a response, i finally got through to the regional manager, jennell williams to help us in setting up a reservation. i managed to reserve a spot for last sunday for a group of 10. turns out a reservation wasn't really necessary, as it was still preseason and the restaurant was pretty empty. there was one other group drafting too and about 3-4 groups dining. nevertheless, they had a table set up for us close to the bar when i arrived. we got our draft kit and set up our board. getting logged onto the wifi was a breeze.the restaurant is smaller than some of the bdubs locations i've been to. the main tvs are around the bar, which is conveniently situated in the middle of the restaurant. i can see how this would be a great place to get some beers and watch some games.our servers were very attentive, special thank you to our waitress who was very friendly and responsive to our large group.we put down a orders for 3 large wings and 4 sides. the wings were all very tasty and fresh. we also ordered nachos, mozzarella sticks, fried pickles (the best) and nachos. the nachos didn't have much in terms of meat on them, and given the chance, we probably would have ordered something else. i ordered a couple special edition ""fantasy football"" draft ipls, which were pretty good.overall, we had a great experience drafting at bdubs in koreatown, and we'll definitely be back for some games."
"we came here for their happy hour, we both ordered the hh tender slammers i added cheese on my slammers which come with a side of fries, she ordered the tender slammers with a side salad.  lots of food for only $5.00...and pretty tasty too!  the margarita tastes pre-made...not my favorite...dear mr. buffalo wild wings...please bring in the wine for those of us who would dearly like it on your menu :o)"
"celebrated a friends birthday with a total of 12 of our friends here. that's a lot of people. we ordered our food and it arrived in a good timely manner! props to our server!! the appetizer and wings were really good! we ordered traditional wings with the flavors asian zing , bbq, and buffalo. all tasted great! i have no complaints. parking can be a hassle. here are some parking  tips i hope will help you in the future. tolerating la traffic is a series of defeats and small victories--but mostly defeats. the same is often true of parking; anyone who's circled the block in koreatown or paid a premium for a spot on the sunset strip knows the agony of finding street parking.but parking doesn't have to be all doom and gloom. those small victories? you can thank curb colors for those. here's the gist: you can never park at a red curb, and white curbs--with a tiny number of exceptions--are for passenger loading only. but green and yellow-painted curbs are the secret spots of la street parking. during the day they camouflage themselves as seemingly open spaces that you can't actually park in, but at night it's like they're saved just for you.yellow curbsotherwise known as loading zones, these yellow-painted curbs are usually limited to passenger loading and commercial vehicles during the day. but in most la county cities, they turn into regular parking spots (subject to any posted street signs) at night. here are when yellow curbs are enforced (meaning don't park there during these times, but do park there otherwise):los angeles: mon-sat, 7am-6pmbeverly hills: mon-sat, 7am-6pmburbank: mon-sun, 8am-6pmculver city: mon-sat, 7:30am-6pmglendale: mon-sat, 9am-6pmhermosa beach: mon-sat, 7am-6pminglewood: mon-sat, 7am-6pmlong beach: mon-sat, 7am-6pmmanhattan beach: mon-sun, 7am-6pmpasadena: mon-sat, 6am-6pmredondo beach: mon-sat, 7am-6pmsanta monica: mon-sat, 7am-6pmsouth pasadena: mon-sat, 6am-6pmtorrance: mon-sat, 7am-6pmwest hollywood: mon-sat, 7am-6pmunincorporated la county: mon-sat, 7am-6pmgreen curbsthese short-term parking spots are typically limited to 15 or 30-minute limits. not every city uses green curbs--they're absent in west hollywood and manhattan beach--but for those that do, they're only enforced during these hours:los angeles: mon-sat, 8am-6pmbeverly hills: mon-sat, 7am-6pmburbank: mon-sun, 8am-6pmculver city: mon-sun, 7:30am-6pmglendale: mon-sat, 9am-6pmhermosa beach: 24/7inglewood: mon-sat, 7am-6pmlong beach: mon-sat, 9am-6pmpasadena: mon-sat, 6am-6pmredondo beach: mon-sun 7am-6pmsanta monica: 24/7south pasadena: mon-sat, 6am-6pmtorrance: mon-sat, 8am-6pm"
"like many others. i had a long wait but didn't mind cuz it was busy. i get that.the girl takes our order. i ask for some simple water. she never brought it. benefit of the doubt, she'll eventually bring it cuz she has other things to do. nope! and they were out of sliders so one of my peeps didn't eat anything.another server brings our wings and i never even got my water. lame, but whatever, i'll deal.but then! the wings were stale af! they looked like some refried chicken nuggets. and i got the lemon pepper and barely one had any seasoning. super disappointed. when we got the check, my friends commented about the water and she offered to bring it. like, really? girl i'm bouncing, gtfo i am not waiting another 30 minutes for some water.overall. unsatisfactory. the only reason i gave 2 stars instead of one is cuz the servers weren't rude. but other than that, the food and service were subpar."
"i've been here 3 times since they've opened... it's been horrible every time. the only reason i returned the 3rd was because i had a $25 gift card lmao. 1st my boy benjamin frank on the forearm served me and the homie. he was decent at his job, they had just opened, he was hollerig and all the fifis around him. food came out colder than trump's cabinet, it was wild no asked if they had ever been reheated since they been off the truck. it was bad. 2nd time i came to see the kings game. rolled up with the same homie, then came thru. took about 55 min to be sat, they were busy af so i wasn't tripping. food came out and was subpar. took a bit, kinda felt like she forgot about us. the kings lost so that night was just an l. third time, with the gift card, i hopped on a bird scooter, pulled up and went straight to the bar. no wait, bitchin seat. figured it was about to go down. then i sat for 15 min waiting for the bartenders to stop washing all these damn cups and got a beer. they got me again. they dont toss the tenders in sauce. you can only get 'boneless' tossed in sauce. was in the middle of asking bout some onion rings, cause i rolled up solo, and she walked off. i asked who makes the new england ipa and was told ""it's really good"". long story short, hard pass."
"i came here with a friend, after hearing so much about this place. we finally decided to try it out. there wasn't any ""wow"" factor to the place, other than the fact that they had multiple sauces for their wings. i really liked their boneless wings, but there was just something off about the place. i suppose it would be a better experience while watching sports or hanging out with friends but for now, i'm still feeling halfway about this place. hopefully i can come back and have a better experience. only thing i highly suggest is their boneless specials on thursdays. i think that's really worth it."
"i went to buffalo wild wings for the first time today and had such a horrible experience. we ordered appetizers that took more than 20 minutes to come out. our food didn't come out for at least another 15 to 20 minutes after that.. our server was unattentive and forgetful. i can understand if it was really busy, but it was sunday afternoon with no lunch rush and plenty of seating as the restaurant was not busy. the crunchy berries milkshake that i ordered tasted like milk and ice chips that weren't even blended well. the food that was served wasn't even hot and the spinach and artichoke dip looked like it had been sitting before it was even brought to our table. then when i asked to speak with the manager, he didn't seem to really be empathetic about our horrible experience but in the end offered to give us a discount should i decide to go back there... i am pretty understanding of servers and restaurants when they are really busy and things get overlooked but being in a restaurant that wasn't busy at all, the food was not that great and the service was even worse, i could not just sit by and not say anything. i'm not sure if i would go back to take the manager up on his discount for the next time based on how horrible my experience was today but to spend $100 on food that we barely touched and not even get an apology for the crap service, was just mind boggling.... i think i might be better off going to hooters"
"the lack of hype was real!! the trash service was real!!! it was pretty slow, friday afternoon, early happy hour, between 5 and 7.... server rarely came by, when i arrived, took 15 minutes to get my order taken, it took forever to get additional orders... david, my server hardly came to even check in on us... barely got our last order in before happy hour was over... was attempting to get his attention from 6:38 to 6:54, he ignored our waving... and even when trying to close out, david kept ignoring us, and marvin the manager didn't care much either... when i said ""we've been trying to close out for awhile"", he chuckled... definitely not returning, if i do, it's for takeout only... and clearly they don't give their hosts lunch breaks... jennifer couldn't put her wing down when validating our parking... no reason there should be 3 tvs on the same basketball game when there are 3 different basketball games on..."
"for a dedicated chain sports bar in la to not have the weekend dodger game is unacceptable. we are completely surrounded by tvs and you are too cheap to pay for spectrum??? that means you aren't a sports bar or even an la bar. even denny's has the dodger game on, come on! not to mention you have multiple people wearing dodger gear all over the restaurant and i have to ask twice to find out you don't have the game after it's already started. by the way, the manager that toldus they had the same fight with the lakers and it ""didn't hurt their bottom line"" way to care about your local sports fans and care about customer input. no wonder they only have a two star review, the worst version of a chain."
food was good but there was no ac. apparently it's been broken for a month but management doesn't want to do anything about it. eating my mango habanero with no ac and it being 110 degrees outside was one of the most horrible experience i've been through. please fix your ac or else i won't be coming back...
food was great. it's .75 boneless wings night and tried the parmesan garlic and the korean bbq both very delicious. the only disappointment was the service. it's rather slow and this was apparently considered a slow night for the overall restaurant. im glad i didn't come on a busy night. waited 15 minutes intervals before getting waitress to return and even had to ask a hostess for a water refill. maybe they need some extra staff because the waitress seems to be juggling at least 8-10 tables by herself.
"buffalo wild wings (bww) has finally arrived in koreatown on the corner of wilshire and vermont. it is your typical sports bar with a multitude of flat screen television monitors hanging from every corner, but the place is much cleaner and much newer. i went on boneless thursdays, which means you get a special price on boneless wings all day. although i prefer dark meat, the white meat with the parmesan garlic was not too shabby and had the right amount of heat. my main eat was the hickory pulled pork with a side of french fries. it was just okay, a bit on the salty side. the fries were pretty generous, but i went with a bunch of friends and some portions weren't as generous. i was super hungry when i came and usually when i'm hungry, the food would be expected to taste that much better. . . and then some. this was not the case at bww. it was just okay to me. i think the biggest draw is if you are a sports fan and just want some wings, this place will fit the bill. but in terms of actual quality and taste, you can get much better elsewhere. come for the sports, not for the food."
"worst bartender at a corporate establishment i've had.  couldn't manage eight people sitting at the bar and server tickets seemed almost non-existent.  as a former bartender, with a shift like this there is no excuse for a fountain drink or water to be less than half full at any time.  my fountain drink sat empty on the bar pour mat for over 30 minutes and i had to ask for a refill.  also ordered off a special menu, $3 jack 1/2 shots.  i heard him ask a manager for price clarification, but never said anything to me.  bill had them at $5 when i got it. also asked to close out and my card then laid on the bar for 20 minutes after immediately presenting my card when i got the slip.  this might all seem petty, but when you've done the job it is just blatant poor training/multi-tasking by the staff member."
"seems like this place has hired all new peps with no idea how to work the system server was lost, she didn't come ask us if we wanted to order or for drinks until about 3 other tables were filled with people -ordering was easy(after we finally got a menu) -beer option? hmm was there any? cause they seriously was out of like 5 different beers! wth? -wings were bomb as always-fries were cold! -took our server about 10mins to cash the other able out and about 5/6mins to ring up our tab!(i'm assuming she's still learning the computer system) -manger on duty seemed lazy and didn't help his poor hard working waitress/waiters that looked to be struggling overall great wings but i rather drive to glendale for bww! we at least till this place improves -they validate -and have a good selection of music"
"came here on 3:00pm, and my boyfriend and my ftiends went there for 13 times in a row with the staff and we sat on the tables and came it for the party crew out there. so my first order will be asian zing boneless wings without celery and carrots for each, and i got some onion rings and mac and cheese and for my drink will be bud light for 6 each! my boyfriend ordered carribbean jerk traditional wings for each order, and we decided to share so much.for my friends ordered:french friesmac and cheesebuffalo mac and cheesescreamin nacho burgercheese curd bacon burgerdrinks for my friends:chocolate cake blendercrunch berries blenderafter for my experience, and it was such a great time for the buffalo wild wings but my favorite part is the takeout, because i got for my stomach hurt for the 21st time ever!"
"buffalo wild wings corporate clearly doesn't care about how badly their customers are treated.  i called them to make sure they were aware of the issue over a week ago and still have yet to hear a response.  glad to know i wrote them off ... their loss!**edit**i did end up getting a call from two general manager's marvin and joshua who left voicemails.  when i called back i was able to speak to marvin about the issue.  to bww's credit he did offer to give me a gift card to cover the cost of my parking but i respectfully declined stating i didn't see myself visiting them again.  he acknowledged there was a teaching moment for the managers and staff regarding the parking, and marvin even stated he was unaware that parking was cash only, but he would follow through with his staff about the issue.  unfortunately it's to little to late in my eyes considering what i had to go through and then follow up on.  i only got a call back after i followed up on bww's contact us portion of their website.  you can easily fix issues as they arise but you can't easily fix bad management (rene).  good riddance!"
"this review is long over due!my boyfriend and i came here during our trip to socal. we originally wanted to go to roscoe's, but it was just so packed there. so.. b-dubs was the move. we did not wait too long before we were seated so i thought that was cool. the workers were also nice so i appreciated that a lot. our server was somewhat attentive, but it was not all the way there. i seen him multiple times stopping to talk with a co-worker. yes, i understand that is how you make work fun, but you have two customers here who need extra water and extra ranch, wyd? the only attached photo is our onion rings, but we also had wings and then my boyfriend had a sandwich. i enjoyed my wings a lot, but i will forever be team wingstop. but i cannot lie... b-dubs' fries go crazy!"
"service is slow, no air conditioning, dirty restaurant, no music for the first 15 minutes we were there so it was awkwardly quiet, and one order of wings took over 25 minutes. smh"
"the wait was pretty long. and bringing the food out to us was ever longer. but besides that, the food was great! i enjoyed every bit of it. definitely glad i spent my vacation stuffing my face here. worth every penny!"
"they messed up my order last time, had to drive back. decided to give it another try. ordered again, food was ready 35 mins past the time my email said it would be ready. the only thing the front girl ""violet"" is serving is a nasty stank look on her face. ignores you when you're asking her to check on your order or ask what's going on... literally no help at all from the start and a lot of attitude."
worst bbw i have ever been too .. especially for being in hollywood.. came to eat with my family and off the bat we had to wait for a table ( when there was about 5% capacity) to wait 10 minutes because they had to do a shift change ... second we were handed our menus without being asked what we wanted to drink ... horrible horrible service !!!!
"food - the food was okay! the wings i enjoyed and it wasn't too dry like other wings places--definitely juicy but one of their sandwiches my parents ordered was a little bit too salty. customer service - it was honestly terrible. when i walked in with my family, we were greeted with an annoyed ""hi, welcome"" and the girl didn't know how long the wait would be when there were a lot of empty tables (you could've guesstimated it). most of the servers looked like they hated their job and seemed too annoyed when we ordered and asked for other things. maybe that's why it was so empty because the customers probably wouldn't want to come back. i'm so glad the one in oc have better staff members who actually look happy and aren't so annoyed."
"especially on boneless thursdays - there's nothing like some honey bbq wings and a blue moon beer at bdubs to fill you up!love coming here because they serve food late and it's a great spot to get some munch on with your friends. although honey bbq is my favorite flavor for wings, they sport like 12 different kinds of sauces you can use for your wings. my other favs include the garlic parmesan and the mango habanero. when i came here last, honestly i thought our server was alright (can't remember his name) but the busser, capri, was super friendly/funny and really helpful when my friends and i had questions. he made our experience great. also....this place is a sports bar! so like literally any game day of anything they probably got it!!i recommend their beer over their cocktails.***parking in the area is hard/expensive! try for a meter on the street.will def be coming back!"
"have you ever craved a balloon. not blowing one up and having the satisfying task of then popping it... i'm talking eating a balloon. no, never crave that? then yeah, it's best you do not ever go to a buffalo wild wings. ever. my husband wanted wings. i agreed because initially i thought we were going to this delicious place on melrose ave, alas, when we started walking, he said ""no, we are going to buffalo wild wings."" the fak! if i knew, i would have eaten at home before joining him as simply company. when we got to bww at noon, it was not crowded at all, and while surprised (because isn't sunday football day?), i also wasn't in the least because this place has always sounded nasty to me. because i drag my husband everywhere i want to go all the time, i just told myself, get a grilled chicken salad, they can't f that up... a 2-year-old could make one.ha! i was wronger than wrong.the service was fine, albeit a tad bit confused as to how to deal with patrons, but once seated our server seemed confident enough. she quickly gave us waters and was ready for our order... i got the grilled chicken salad, with an extra portion of chicken, no dressing or cheese or croutons and i added avocado. my husband got the medium wings with some random sauces i didn't really pay attention to because i was too transfixed on the other gross menu options.our waitress happily walked away... but came back a few minutes later saying that they were out of avocado (not surprised), and this bummed me out more. a naked chicken salad with no avocado is the reason why i don't go out to american restaurants, i can make way better food at home, and when our food arrive, this was clearly confirmed. while the salad actually looked decent, i was initially thrilled that i ordered another serving on chicken because the original size was minuscule. that being said, when i finally decided to dive in.... the chicken resembled more of a dog chew toy than anything else. i ate two piece of rubbery chicken, swallowed, questioning wtf i ate... ate some bell peppers on the salad and then took a piece of chicken alone and tried to bite in. verdict: rubber. i showed my husband the ""magic trick"" and he didn't believe me, thus took the chicken himself, trying to bite it and he too couldn't bite through... repulsed but still a bit hungry, i tried to eat some other pieces... but everything was downright balloon status.i'm not one to ever leave food on my plate but... i barely ate any of it... just some salad greens and i pushed it away. i knew i was going to pay for this later and boy was i right. my husband's wings... i'm sure you're wondering, they were... below average at best. more breading than chicken, that's for sure... he basically paid $18 for a plate of fried bread. he was very disappointed.that being said, all we could do was joke about it saying: welp, looks like we found our new sunday tradition! ha! hardly... unless i want to feel like i am going to throw up for the rest of the day. i kid you not. i felt like i had a balloon, chew toy, was of plastic bags, stuck in my throat for a good 4-5 hours and i even contemplated making myself throw up to expel the poison i just ingested. this very well goes down in the books as the worst meal i have ever had in my entire life. i will no longer feel guilty making my husband go to places i like, at least i take us to restaurants that have edible food!"
bad service. called an hour before they closed and they wouldn't take a pickup order. have been occasionally vibed by the young wait staff. they should do a better job hiring. update 6/15/2018: calling-in seems to work well. hit or miss but this recent oder had a much better experience. shae was as delightful on the phone with great customer service. generally that's a tall ask for this location but bwds product is pretty consistent so a bit of redemption...
"worst service i've experienced at any bww location. no one acknowledged us for like 20 mins, we got our food quick, but then when we we were done and ready to pay, our waitress took another 20 minutes. it wasn't even a full house so there was no excuse for the poor service. the place was also very smoky inside. just a bad experience over all. smh bww!"
you usually can't go wrong with bww...the food was good but the drinks suck! we ordered a bloody mary and a strawberry margarita which were watered down. don't order alcoholic beverages from here.
"been to many buffalo wild wings but this one had the worst service ever, so bad that we had to walk out after waiting for service 15 minutes"
"we were skeptical to try this bww because of the 2 stars but we were in the area and decided to give it a try anyways. place was empty for being a monday evening. our server sophie was amazing- friendly, kept on top of our order and drinks, and always smiled. food came out on time. and for the first time the wings were extra wet! never have i had a chef/cook get it right. idk why this bww only has 2 stars. probably the best experience i've ever had at any of the  bwws i been to."
"avoid. avoid. photos of their chicken on their website looks really tasty. i tried it out last night and it was horrible. their chicken were so dry and it was so mushy, i'd probably make chickuacamole with it. you will regret it if you try their chicken out from this place."
"i recently discovered this place. i went to one by el camino college and it was great. went to the one in culver city and the experience was the same. so of course i though the hollywood would be the same ...wrong! homeless men were sitting in the outdoor patio smoking, trash all over the floor and the smell of urine was hard to not notice. the food was good, not great like my previous two experiences. customer service: the staff was nice. slow. but nice. we left a good tip. but the establishment itself could use some help. i won't come back here. parking available in the parking structure for $20. better than spending hours looking for street parking. the restrooms were filthy. trash on the floor. no toilet paper or seat covers. blood on the toilet. tampon wrappers on the floor. it was truly disgusting."
"i haven't had wings in a long time, and boy was i excited to come here tonight! this was probably the most pleasant visit i've had at a bww... ever! here's the breakdown:1. price: welp, most bww have a deal going on during some days in the week.. like .65 boneless wings, or whatever it is that specific bww is offering.. but idk if they are just getting cheap or they are just losing money, but those deals are gone now. tuesdays at the bww has buy one get on boneless. otherwise, i got the small traditional (10 pcs/2 flavors) $13.. which gave the docking of that one star.. 2. menu: they had a separate menu for happy hour items.. so be sure to check that out before you order. its mostly small bites ($4) and beers ($1.50 off?). my usual order is the garlic parm and asian zing or dry buffalo rub. with ranch and carrots and fries! this time, my friends and i ordered lemon pepper fries! which was fantastic! guess i haven't been in awhile because i didnt even know you can flavor up your fries! lol! 3. service: exceptionally better than my past hundred visits to any bww! our waitress was pretty efficient and gave us enough attention to serve well. i hope its always like this.. cause the restaurant was honestly empty. lol! which is something i'm not used to seeing. usually i'm fighting assholes for a table. 4. parking: opt for street parking. given its in the heart of hollywood.. i am almost sure those structures will screw you with parking prices. if you are the unlucky one, go down the street a bit and take a nice stroll as you make your way down hollywood!"
worst fucking customer services they had their fucking heater on while every customer was complaining about it shit as place
"usually i don't mind bdubs, but today i was a little disappointed. decided to do delivery and ordered two of the half traditional/half boneless wings deal and got each with fries. they got the sauces right but i had asked for one set to have cajun fries, the other to come with the chipotle bbq seasoning on the fries. not only did the fries come plain, but both meals came with zero boneless wings. so again, the only thing they actually got correct were the flavorings of the wings. bummer."
"great spot 4 us 2 hang out with friends, coworkers, relatives, dates, etc. good eat and great drinks + sports; what else can a guy ask 4"
"this is the worst buffalo wild wings! the service was shit, i had two different servers, the first server forgot about us and after 15+mins another server had finally came to get our order after waiting around and trying to get someone's attention. the food took almost 30 mins or more to come out and we only got checked on once out of the whole hour+ we were there.. my bf and i only got 1 ranch each for 18 wings, our basket of fries tasted a bit stale, we didn't get any refills, my server was no where to be found and when she would be around, she'd be flirting with other customers and either ignore us or avoid walking toward our table. when the manager walked by, we tried getting his attention after we kept saying excuse me but he walked right by us to go serve a family that looked like it could've been his family because he sat with them. the restaurant was really dirty out of all of the other buffalo wild wings, there are security guards walking around just eyeballing you as you eat and it makes you feel uncomfortable. oh and there's big cockroaches all over the patio as you walk inside/outside.. it's gross. after this horrible experience, we are never coming back to this location. i rather drive to glendale or pasadena where i know the service is 100%, where it's clean and the food is on point."
"i rated this place 2 stars because it is officially complete garbage due to lack of basic common sense & customer service skills, who hired these pathetic ass employees lol, boh works 100x better than foh hands down, and i know this because this is my updated review. 09/18/18     last nights' impertinent night crew proudly introduced me to the real definition of feeble-minded. retraining your staff should be considered and mandatory. retrain em all, from the restaurant servers to the retarded faggot of a bartender y'all got. i held my tongue last night for multiple reasons.  i understand bartenders care the least but c'mon! you're ignorant retarted lazy and mad at your underachieved life, boohoo oh well, it makes sense i suppose. and it's ok if you didn't want to take my food order, cool you're a fag anyway , send someone my way, don't give me a stupid look and say ""i don't know"". you work there but go ahead and act oblivious to general questions haha, welllll it makes sense, naturally ignorant just like everyone around you. i would apply to this location only because i feel bad for all of you & would love to show you the difference easy money , but then again i'd feel really sorry working beside the intellectually disabled cuz i'd be shiitttting on all of you, including the managers! i would insist y'all get your shit together but how about we just laugh at the thought of it instead, lol that's the farthest you'll get!  wish you all luck"
"the worst service i've ever received . the people are so rude, and don't seem to care about anything . on top of that the food takes so long to get here . will not be coming to this location anymore ."
"love the wings, but the takeout process and non-wings need a ton of work. 2 stars is my review and the current average, an accurate measure of the bdubs in the trip8."
"i mean damn. this buffalo wild wings and every other bww i've been to has had incredibly slow service. it's hard to even flag down a waiter because everyone is less than enthused to be working here. it took me a cool 25 min before i even put in my order. they also always forget something. i ordered a shot of jameson and it was forgotten, i flag our waitress down after she passed us like 5 times and reminded her. 5 min later she returns to tell me they don't have jameson and if johnny walker is okay. i wish i would have known that it would be $11 for a small shot -_- are you serious? i mean i could get a whole long island iced tea. we did ask for the chicken wings extra crispy so i get why they took forever and the wings came out super crispy too!! wings were bomb though, i'll give them that. i wish there were more wing spots -_-"
"it's always something dealing with the hood. i came into bww at 5:00 on a wednesday. as i was sitting there, it was freezing and i had some liquor in me so i should've been warm. i went to the manager terrance and asked him if he could turn the air down because me and my party was cold. he said no because there are going to be a lot of people coming in and it's hard to bring the temperature back down. so much for accommodating your guests right? i ended up going to my car to get a jacket and was still cold. we dined in for at least an hour and the establishment never filled up. safe to say i won't be back. p.s. last time i was here it took forever for the employees to address me. i'm wondering, does this type of service only exist in the hood? i'll go to the bww i'm hollywood next time and see what happens. i don't see how you refuse to accommodate your guests. as i was talking to the employees, they said they already asked him before i did and he refused. then i saw some employees working in long sleeve shirts under their work shirts and it made sense."
"wings were greasy, soft/chewy and not crispy at all even though i ordered them well done to get a bit of crunch. their garlic wings just tasted like butter and oil. unless you're meeting people to watch a game, there are plenty of other places to get wings that are better than this."
"i am only giving them one star because you can't give zero stars. waited at a bar self seating table for well over 15 minutes, we were never even approached and asked if we wanted a drink or food. in addition to which, the table was never cleaned, left dirty and unattended as several servers walked by. i have been to several bww locations in different states and this has to be by far the worst! in fact the others i have visited were just fine and had good service.i had been here previously and it was super slow lackluster service, and i convinced my husband to give it another chance since our daughter dances nearby and we need a placeto hang out while she is in class. what a shame! had at least five servers walk by and not even acknowledge we were there. seriously, who manages this location? and their mission statement is a joke. their mission is to wow you! hardly, unless they mean wow! as in wow what a shame or wow i had no idea a franchise location could be this horrible! no service and poor attitudes!"
"eeeeeeeh! i ordered takeout - it was extremely easy.  i used the bww app and it was extremely easy to use, fast and efficient.  when i got to the restaurant, the takeout seemed to be ""in the weeds"" while the restaurant itself did not appear to be busy.  the takeout girl was really nice, but could use some help.  she was by herself and clearly could not handle the small crowd that was forming.when i got home to eat my chicken i found that it was overcooked and dry.  depite the fact that i ordered ""hot"" sauce, it did not taste very spicy (fyi my palatte cannot handle extremely spicy food).  i seriously doubt that i would be in a rush to come back anytime soon."
"happy hour here is very inexpensive and good.  it was crowded because dodgers and raiders were planning and the representation was deep.  i tried the limited blue moon bone in wings and they were delicious and i do not drink beer.  now the happy hour drink menu was cool, which i order the margarita (weak) but the long island was popping.  cheers to bww"
the service sucks. we came in tuesday night and got 3 different groups sat in the same time. i came with my best friend and her son. and there was another two different group. we did not see our server. we never knew who he was until the end when i was paying. i think his name is jose. i also forgot now.another man had to take our order because we kept asking someone to take our order. we got sat down before the table next to us. and their server is already taking their order! no water was served either. won't be back
it's  sad that this place has not improved since i went there three years ago. i have not returned and from the reviews i have read it was a good decision.
"this place sucks i waited more than 20 min and no one took our order so we left and went to denny's. we really wanted wings but it's not worth the service. the waiters and waitresses were rude and some of them were just standing around, walked by our table more the 5 times. never go to this buffalo wild wings."
"absolutely horrendous service. maybe they're understaffed or they don't know how to do their jobs.told us the wait for a party of 8 would be 45 min. we waited 1.5 hrs. during our wait, i watched as employees that were still on the clock leave the store to order food from elsewhere. the host took his time taking us to the table that was not ready. didn't distribute menus. no one came to take our drinks for the 15 minutes we sat there. at that moment we were thoroughly done and just got up to leave. no staff was around to say anything or apologize."
"worst service ever. 10 minutes to finally get acknowledged after i was seated.  my waitress was a joke. no customer service whatsoever.  i was a waiter before so i have high expectations on what a real waiter with customer service should be. as i sat patiently waiting on my food, i was observing all the waiters, and each and everyone has no type of customer service nor experience waiting tables. 2 servers chitchat for almost 5 minutes on the floor. ladies, take your personal conversations to the break room. definitely not coming here. get it together bww"
"there's a stigma associated with this place; the food is too expensive, the drinks aren't good, and with this particular location i often times hear it's dangerous. quite the contrary i must say. i've tried the wings and everything in between. i've also tried the beers on tap, bottles, and glasses and i have no complaints whatsoever.  one of my favorite things aside from the chipotle bbq wings are the street tacos and the cheeseburger. yes is said cheeseburger. it's one of the tastiest burgers out there in my opinion. everything that i've ordered here has been delicious. i'm not sure where folks are coming up with these things but this place is the antithesis of what people are saying. the servers are always nice as well. very personable people. i like the attention they give each of heir customers, no complaints there either.  bww is a great place to get great food, meet new people, and watch sporting events and games."
"came on a sunday afternoon (before nfl season) had to be less than 15 people in here and the service was extremely slow as others have mentioned. they brought out part our order and i was almost done before my mom's order came out. our waitress was good, until she went on a break. simple fixes can make this a better restaurant. the food was decent, i've had better at other locations."
"sunday, november 19, 2017, 2:36pm. sunny, 78 degrees.the indoor is packed, but the outdoor seating is not being serviced because ""there is no server available."" outdoor seating on a day like this in november is why people live in los angeles. inexcusable.thanks for having a patio next door, chipotle!"
how does someone take 35 mins to greet you??? then another 20 for mozzarella sticks my drinks get there after my food too. worst service definitely hope they do something about it. manager no where to be found..... currently still waiting for my server to come back.
"simply put 3 and a half stars because whenever i visit this location (i've been here a few times), the wings take some time before they arrive after ordering. i also got some water stains on one of my utensils which i got a bit skeptical about :/ but when the food does arrive, it's always good. happy hour is also a great time for good deals on food and drinks."
"worst customer service ever, salty wings. not coming back. had very salty wings today, asked to talk to the manager, he just said ""well, we don't make the sauces, we'll tell the people above to make them less salty"" poor poor costumer service."
"really disappointing all around. came in for lunch with my husband and daughter for father's day. took a long time for a server to greet us and a very long time to get our drinks. we put our food order in right when the drinks arrive. nothing too complicated at all. small wings. basket of buffalo chips. kids chicken meal and buffalitos with pico on the side. took over 45 min for food to come out and when it did come out the buffalitos were cold and had the pico on them. and basket of chips were missing. server took it back. waited at least another 20 min. meanwhile,my husband and daughter were almost finished eating. server came by to drop off the new buffalitos. literally sat them on the edge of the table and ran away. only to be wrong again. and this time it had pico on them again with no sour cream and no buffalo sauce. completely different. the most frustrating part is not only not getting to eat, is that when we asked for a manager, he came to our table and stated he was already  aware of the situation but hadn't come to talk to us on his own knowing our frustration. so yeah. no fun. we didn't ask for anything,only our food. manager comped the food but left the drinks for us to pay. super disappointing."
"one of the best bww's i've ever been to. came on a saturday early evening, sat in the bar area. highly recommend beating the long wait. it's the same cheap service with bad waiters. but the food was great, good sports and better beer. can't complain only that there is no dodgers baseball! we figured it out anyways. come enjoy cheers. a lot of friendly armenians too!"
this place has good wings and fries that are great. good beer selection also. love all the tvs. most staff are friendly and attentive but some of the time it has taken 15 mins for some to talk to me at the bar.
"hey everyone, i came here for my sister's school fundraiser, and i got the cheeseburger with bacon and grilled onion. the burger was decent. great service though."
"came out of finishing up mass and my choir group and i decided to grab dinner here. we should have read the reviews for this place before coming here.we didn't wait too long to have our party of 11 to be seated, but it took awhike for our server to get our drinks out and it took her even longer to get our orders in. we waited almost an hour for our food to come out and sometimes our waitress was mia for long periods of time while other servers didn't bother to assist us.the food was what any typical buffalo wild wings would serve, so my boyfriend and i shared a large order of boneless wings with fries and a ginger lemonade.i think what was upsetting was just how slow our server was in making sure we had our drinks and food order placed, especially since we knew what we wanted, but had to wait an additional 5 plus minutes to place our food order. i honestly didn't end up giving a good tip too, especially since she took forever in getting our checks from us when we were ready to pay and literally flagged her down by waving out checkbooks in the air.you have been fairly warned!!!"
"ok, so here is the deal. i usually pass a bad experience and leave a comment when it's an incredible food experience, but this is not the case. this is an experience of really really really (yes, 3 times) bad experience. when your server is just a order taker with immense lack of emotion, when your food arrives so late that's it's pointless to even eat, when ... ugh... i am done even writing. in this day and age, restaurants having these types of major flaws are destined to bad hardship."
food was ok but the service was extremely slow.there was lots of open tables but hostess asked us to wait and after 10 min we got our table. that was bizarre. takes too long to get the order and also we wait over 15 min to get our check.
"omg this place is horrible, do not come here. i came around 8:30 pm dinner for my birthday had my whole family come we didn't get our food til 10:30 pm. we were so upset because we had plans to go out after we ate. we asked what the hold up was and their excuse was that ""we are understaffed."" if you guys were understaffed and we are a large couldn't you have told us that from the beginning? our food surprisingly came when we asked for it. we then asked to speak to a manager and a guy came, put his arms on our chair and said ""what's up bro?"" as a manager how do you just confront a customer like that as if he knew us in a personal way so we asked to speak to a higher manager btw that guy should not be a manager because he sure didn't act like one. the other manager helped us more but it still didn't give me back time to spend more with my family on my birthday we had lost our appetite at that point i didn't even eat my food and gave it to my boyfriend which hadn't ate since he got off work. i didn't get to do anything after my birthday and we all had to go home. the manager offered 3 $10 gift cards but their was 10 of us.... like what? this place needs help, these people are confused and do not care. every single time i came was the same thing but this time just drew the line. i will never come here again, the burbank location is so much better and so is the customer service. i'm telling you guys if you're trying to save your money and time do not come here unless you're trying to wait 2 hours for cold wings and fries with bad customer service."
"love the wings as always!! but, i did not like where we where sat. ( small table in the corner). server was super nice at the beginning but she kinda for got about us. we had to be waiting for her to appear to ask for the check."
"one of the best spots to watch a game. in everything direction you look; you'll find a tv.the wings are one of the best i have tried by far!!a little disappointed that they discontinued the discounted wings on tuesdays and wednesdays.now the have a deal where you buy a wing and you get one free. it's not that bad but you definitely save more money with the old deal they had.but other than that, everything is great!"
"tourists and non-nationals beware.  this establishment/chain does not allow anything outside of a passport booklet to consume alcohol.  my family had a +21 non-national who's non-passport was not accepted, regardless if having the seal and everything that goes with national identification and we were eventually harassed by a manager (assuming it's a ""shift"" manager). before this we asked the waitress if it was okay to just order a second beer and go about our way since the non-national was clearly late 20s. this was due to the waitress calmly telling us the establishment wouldn't accept her national id card and only a passport booklet.   10 minutes into our meal, the shift manager appears and clearly raises his voice scolding our table/family for allowing the +21 war old to drink the beer and threatens us with removing the beer and charging us full price for said beer. i calmly asked him if a person with an id ordered it and a 21+ is drinking it, should it matter since the transaction was legal and the consumer is of legal age... he responded by border line yelling ""i will lose my liquor license, i will lose my job if you keep doing this and i will have to remove you from the establishment if she drinks from the glass"".  message received.  well. that's it. food was good. waitress was accommodating but management/corporate has a serious problem at some level of the corporate ladder. btw, them verifying id and their policy took an extra 10 minutes on top of ordering and getting our drinks to begin with. btw the tvs weren't loud enough for him to yell, it was 3 in the afternoon with all the screens playing baseball. even the table next to us was worried and made a comment to us about the treatment."
not a bad place to have wings and beer ... i just wish they we a little more on point with the refills ... i come to drink and eat wings ... checking in on us was a little behind ... but overall can't complain about the wings or drinks
"alright... worst hamburger i've had in a llloong time. how hard it is it? an established franchise to cook a simple hamburger. this was a complete waste of money and stomach space. do not order food from this business. they do not care about the food they cook and you can taste it. it tasted like spicy depression. one thing i hate more than anything is paying for food that i can cook better. keep away from this restaurant unless you're just trying to get drunk and watch sports. even then, i can think of better establishments than this.. just avoid."
"i have definitely had better chicken but i don't think that the quality of the food should dictate the quality of our received service.  i don't even recall the server's name.  it was a tuesday night after an nba playoffs game had finished.  tables were emptying.  things seemed to have slowed down a bit. awesome.  well, we thought that meant that things were going to be awesome.  unfortunately, we were terribly wrong about that.  the waitress came to see us once and brought us water, and took our order.  after that, we saw her walk by several times.  she looked at our table but apparently not close enough.  i think each time she walked by, she only took the moment to notice the glasses that were closest to the edge of the table.  but, because i was sitting on the inside of the booth, it wasn't easily visible.  we'll say that's the excuse for her not bringing me water refills at all. each time that someone did take the opportunity to stop by and ask how we were doing, the other two that i was with said that things were fine.  i always said no! i told them that i needed napkins, water, clean utensils, condiments that one of the food expediters said they'd bring to our table, etc.  it was nice that the manager stopped by but after he brought a water refill, that was the last time that he checked on us.  i explained to him that i was not pleased with our server. he apologized and went to grab the things that we'd asked for. later, other waiters and waitresses walked by.  one of them finally stopped to check on us.  we asked her if she could get our waitress. she said that she could help us but one of the other people in my dining party insisted that it be our waitress that helped us because he felt she should be the one doing her job and not having other people pick up for her where she is slacking. i can understand that kind of frustration!  when she came back, that's when the waitress told us that our waitress was leaving for the night and that she was almost off.  ain't that some sh*t!  we were upset.  not only did she not help us at all but she was leaving for the night and wasn't going to tell us at all. wth? not at all cool. the short version: food was good enough for this bunch of hungry bears. service was literally absent and rude!  parking was easy as it was after 10pm and there were no restrictions. management cared but not enough."
"we came here because we wanted wings but didn't realize there was a ufc fight that same evening and ended up waiting 30+ minutes, and the fight itself was such a letdown.once everyone cleared out, we got a seat at the bar and went straight to ordering. service was slow and inattentive. looks like the servers were paying closer attention to regulars than the hungry patrons like myself. the food runner brought our appetizers out and out and it just sat on the counter until i brought it to their attention that my food was just sitting out.luckily, their wings are always good for me so that made the night slightly better."
"don't ever place a to-go order here. you wait forever because no one checks if it's ready. your order ends up sitting in a warmer and is cold by the time you eat it. on top of that, they forget items!i've given them a second chance with the exact same outcome. never again. their food is good, so if you want to eat hot food, dine in. bonus is you can get your missing items right away...."
"go for the experience. the food was alright but nothing amusing.   i've had better wings elsewhere.  we ordered a side garden salad and a large traditional portion which comes with 20 wings. they let us choose 4 flavors so we tried: asian zing, bourbon honey mustard, parmesan garlic, and their limited time ones (mandarin something). some flavors were better than others, you just have to try them and see what you like. i thought that it was definitely a good portion for two people. service was fine, it was actually relatively busy considering we went on a tuesday night and there was still a wait. could be due to the half priced wings.overall, would come again."
"great service at this location, never have an issue. prefer this location over pasadena even though pasadena is closer."
"tuesdays seem to be the day to go to bww, where you get double your order in wings.  a small order (12 wings) equals a large (24)!service when we went here was efficient and fast.  food was good, and came hot.  had the boneless wings this time - by mistake, i pointed to the wrong side of the menu, but after trying them, they were fine although we prefer the traditional bone in.  we usually have the lemon pepper and hot wings, a combination order.  caesar salad was good.we were there for the late happy hour, but 24 wings and a salad were more than enough food for two, didn't need to order off the happy hour menu.very high ceiling, nice.festive atmosphere, consistent food.when you park in the underground parking, just walk up the side to get to the restaurant.  do not take the elevator.  we did, and ended up in some sort of ""scary"" service/maintenance hallway that reeked of pot.  must be where the employees take smoke breaks!no parking validation."
"the service is straight ass. their food is okay but the waiters are rude and dismissive. the service is slow and our waitress looked disinterested and impatient when we were putting in our orders. it was sooo hard to flag a person down for more water and napkins. when i finally got the attention of a waitress, she laughed when i asked her for more napkins and just walked away. unbelievable. i saw her setting down two drinks for the table behind us so she obviously wasn't on break. furthermore, bathroom is also disgusting. it doesn't seem like they clean it because there was toilet paper everywhere and period blood on the floor!!"
"this b dubs sucks. zero customer service. 1. the host wasn't all too happy to be at work. 2. we waited for 15mins for our server. i finally asked for service and the host told the server to take somebody else's order first. problem is, we arrived about 10mins before that party. i called him out on it and he wasn't apologetic at all. 3. our server was ok. she didn't check on us once we got our food. i went the whole time with my drink empty. 4. the food came out cold. i also ordered my wings and buffalo chips well done and they came out soggy. 5. there seemed to be a lot of managerial presence but clearly that still doesn't motivate the employees to be on their game nor do they correct their subpar hospitality. honestly, this has been the worst visit at a bwws. scratch this location for sure!"
"**do not come here!*** service is really bad. from the front receptionist to waitress. might as well throw the menu at our faces! today is saturday 7/20/2018 @ 12pm, people that worked here at that time are so rude, especially that server ""charity"". she gve me an aytitude when i asked for assistance even after i told her to go ahead and get back to me when she is done doing what shes doing. there are a lot of people who deserve this job that would be happy to bring home $$ for their  family. these females are just not happy and grateful. except our server, daveda... she is a great server and took care of us very well."
great place to ha g out and watch some sports! we celebrated my brothers birthday and just had a fun time with family. food was yummy we ordered baskets of wings spicy to mild.
"came in with my family after a day out. given, it was football sunday so it was packed - i expected that. food was fine, but the customer service was insanely terrible. three girls were gathered at the front desk just chatting. matter of fact, they stayed there the entire time we were there. another girl was hiding in the corner on her phone. mind you - it was really busy. the only saving grace to this place was our server, daveda. she took our order, got it out to us promptly, and checked on us multiple times. i don't even think we were seated in her area, but she took care of us. management, i would suggest you take another look at your staff and fix this."
"the service was terrible. the waitress acted as if she was upset that she had to work there. we ordered fried pickles and received them half cooked. the batter on them was still raw. when we informed the waitress about it, she stated ""what do you want me to do about it."" then she walked by stating ""i can not wait to get out of here."""
"2nd and last time i will ever be there. service = terrible / atmosphere = terrible / food = terrible. it gives the impression that management is never around. place stinks as soon as you walk in and the place is always dirty. our table was visibly dirty even through they had just ""cleaned"" it before we sat down. i had to ask out server to clean the table again as it was sticky and looked down right nasty. our server was in a rush the entire time! every time we asked for something he wouldn't let us finish but rush off as if he had fire ants crawling up his ass. what made matters worse is that the place wasn't even that full in order for him to be rushing the whole time. i took my son there for his birthday per his request so i stayed with my mouth shut but i knew i had to write a review. i wished i would have looked this place up sooner as i noticed that the other 3 closest bww's have bad reviews as well. this franchise must not really care what people say cause they know nasty ass people will still show up.  i hope robert padilla the ""general manager"" does something about this establishment. i'd start off with firing the current staff and hiring one that has some integrity in what they do. this place could be so much better but you're only as good as your weakest link and this place seems to have an abundance of them. next time my son or anyone in my family wants wings rest assured that i will be going to wing stop. mic drop."
really?? imagine biting a wing full of feathers! i asked to have the wings taken away from my table but they didn't even do that until i left!
"ordered door dash from this location.  the order came super fast; probably because the wings were cooked 5 hours before and reheated.  they were some of the toughest, chewy wings.  the wings were also dry.  i think they want you to buy sides of the sauce.the 2 stars are because the flavor of the sauce was good, as well as the onion rings and seasoned fries.  it's a shame the main course fell way short!"
"first let me start and say i am completely disappointed in the service i've just received a buffalo wild wings. i have been eating with bwws for several years now and have never experienced this type of service. as soon as i walked in kayla the hostess, who wasn't even at her post station when we walked in, didn't even greet us just decided to direct us to the bar area. completely understandable if that's policy follow the rules, however once we stated we would like a booth she had the nerve to have an attitude about finding us a seat; then when she got the menus and she just turned her back on us and decided to walk away without even asking us to follow her. then she seated us at the four chair table even after we emphasize that we wanted a booth. our lovely waitress monae ( who is the only reason i gave them an extra star) kindly moved us to the booth area that were we wanted to seated. kayla then decided to walk her, all of a sudden want to be hostess ass over, and asked us again if we wanted to do self seating.  i responded to her she would need to speak to our waitress as we have already confirmed with our waitress that we were allowed to move tables and she was fine with that. she then tried to loudly talk to monae and let her know that we moved from the table we were at is if we already didn't communicate with our waitress. at first, i definitely thought we were being picked on however as our meal proceeding i seen that kayla was on her phone texting and not even greeting the following customers coming in.  as a hostess you need to wear a smile on your face and not bring your outside problems to work or you will make others not want to attend this establishment. sadly there already pretty low on reviews."
"you won't feel guilty here for not leaving a tip. service is slow. 2-3 waiters acknowledge your presence but no execution. and those that acknowledge you, don't even offer to get you a drink ""cause it ain't their table"". and no, it was not busy."
"it took 5 employees and 30 minutes to put in an order and prepare a kid's meal. we put in an order for my toddler at 12:15 pm. despite it being football sunday, the restaurant was incredibly empty. the first hostess said the food should take less than 15 minutes to make. i checked on the food after 20 minutes and again after 25 minutes. we didn't the food until 12:45 pm. the server handed me the food and said ""we forgot to put the sauce on the side, do you want us to remake it?"". we were already running late, so i told her not to worry about it and we'll just take it. i walk out, looked in the bag and realized they didn't add a milk with the kid's meal. went back inside to get it, the second hostess actually said to me, ""oh, i don't know where they keep the milk"". are you serious? that's why you didn't put in the meal? she got two other servers to get the milk and it took another 5-10 minutes until they came back. no validation for parking either, so i had to pay the $2.00 for parking because of the slow and incompetent service of this place. won't be back."
f*ck this shithole!!!i ordered via doordash and i allege that the staff at this location purposefully gets orders wrong and/or gives deliveries the driest wings available. i don't know if this one is corporate or franchise but corporate needs to conduct a full investigation!these were the worst wings i've ever had at a buffalo wild wings!!!!
"i understand it's busy but jim can i get another drink???nba finals, it's super busy and there's a wait for tables i got lucky and found seats at the bar... the wings are always good we never had a problem, in love with these cheese curds!!!so glad i made it in time for happy hour!!!  jack n coke, thank you sir!!!"
"first time here since a lot of people in my office building hate on this place. i figured i'd give it a redeeming review since i got my order in about 10 minutes and had excellent service. pro tip: sit at the bar. as good or better than any other buffalo wild wings i've been to, and a good lunch option for sure."
"love buffalo wild wings. but please please manager of this location stop announcing birthdays like 7 times a night and turning off all the volume and shouting forever into the microphone. it's jarring, really long, and disrupts sports games we came here to watch. only location i've ever seen do this and it happens every time and never ends. still giving 4 stars because... yum."
i love the wings here go dodgers ..severice is the best beer here is always cold it in a perfect location
"horrible service, got are food wrong and we were nice about it, said it's okay. never brought are appetizer over till we had to tell 3 different people, as they all just stand around talking."
"i stopped here around 5:30pm on a tuesday fora quick bite. i love buffalo wild wings but there was something off about this location. i walked in and wasn't greeted so i stood there for a good 5 minutes until someone asked me if i have been helped( the place wasn't busy) i was seated and then no one approached to take my order for a while and then i ordered and i asked for fries, wings and the check so i could pay right away. got my wings, no fries and the bill. the wings tasted off and i didn't enjoy them, they were also cold. there was also a weird smell where i was seating. overall didn't enjoy my experience here the 2 stars are for the waitress because she was very sweet."
"i had a craving for some chicken wings so i had to feed that craving and decided to go with my nearby bdubs location. i placed my order online so by the time i get there i can run in and grab it and be on my way. i went through the easy ordering process online and at the end, i didn't have to put in my credit card information, so i assumed i would pay once i arrive. in the end, it prompted me the time that my order would be ready so i waited at home until close to the time. this location is located inside the plaza of restaurants and stores, but palm is not a drive through street. there is parking on the street on the palm side, there is also a parking structure that is nearby with free parking, also on the back end near the 5 freeway there is more free street parking. i normally park there because all i have to do is park, cross the street, make it through a small flight of stairs and boom its right there next to the movie theater. this is definitely a great location for those that want to hang out with friends, dinner and a movie or froyo or ice-cream. both ben & jerry's and yogurtland are both nearby. ok back to bww loli walked into an expected busy friday evening restaurant. i walked straight up to the to-go counter and gave them my information. it was about 5 pass my expected ready time that was told to me online so i knew this would be quick. the gentleman pulled my order right up and confirmed my order with me. i paid and he went to check on my order. as hungry as i was, i was ready to get back home and tear up my wings as i wiggle my toes in my faux rug. but unfortunately, the cashier came back empty-handed. my order was not ready, dangit stupid online ordering liar. he told me it would be out soon, which soon was another 10 mins. that's not bad at all and once that goodness was in my hands, he asked if i wanted extra ranch or bleu cheese. i quickly accepted his offer and got one of each. he sent me on my way with a smile. once i got home my large traditional, all flats, were just as expected."
"i feel kind of sorry for this location. crazy busy, and by enough staff.so we're coming here on a friday night. it's packed. guy on the front is so run off his feet we go to the bar area and seat ourselves. the girl serving our section comes over looking exhausted, wipes our table and then disappears for almost 20 minutes. no other server will take our order (we asked several - all said it's not their section) and then girl comes back, takes our order and is gone again.we eventually get our foods and drinks (they aren't right but by this point we are all so hungry and thirsty we don't care and she looks so stressed we daren't say anything), and we eat up and leave.if they had a few more staff going, service might be better and customers might be happier (from what i have read in other reviews).food wise it's the same as the rest of the chain, but service wise it's falling behind"
"visited bww last night for the first time in a long time and i was pleasantly surprised with how good it was.my family and i came by around 9:00 pm on a sunday evening and were seated within 10 minutes. we were greeted by karissa, who was covering for our actual server eli. both were friendly and attentive. as for the food, i myself ordered the snack size traditional wings with the carribean jerk sauce. as a table, we also ordered a side of fries and mozzarella sticks.the food came out within a reasonable amount of time. this was my first time having wings since going back to eating meat and i loved it! the wings were crispy on the outside and tender on the outside. the sauce was unique and delicious, with a good hint of spice. the french fries and mozzarella sticks were fantastic as well.overall i was happy with this experience. bww has a great selection of comfort food and i will for sure return!"
"awesome place to watch a sports game! the place is split into two areas- regular meal service or bar seating. if you're here for a normal dinner, prepare to wait as that part of the restaurant can get packed. but if you're okay with sitting on higher seating, then highly suggest bar seating as you can pick where you want to sit.the atmosphere is quite lively as bww brings in all sorts of people- chicken wing enthusiasts, sports team cheerleaders, upbeat groups of friends and families... you name it! the servers here meet up to that high level of spirit so you can bet that you'll have a good time.as for the grub, it's a-ok for me. i was here with my boyfriend and two of our other friends who know how to eat and drink. in total, we got beers, fried pickles, cheese fries, spinach artichoke dip, and wings to share. the highlight for me was the spinach artichoke dip and cheese fries. something about the flavors of those two sides were just right. the fries were also scrumptious with it's warmth, crisp, and light pinch of salt. their wings were not my all-time favorite at the moment but is something i might try again another time. my boyfriend and i split a large portion and decided to try their habanero mango, spicy garlic, buffalo (dry seasoning), and lemon pepper. out of all of those, i really enjoyed the buffalo and lemon pepper but did wish the wings came out a little bit warmer. we split our bill two ways and total came out to be almost $70 per couple. quite steep in my opinion but if you think about it, our check did rack up with all the sides and drinks. don't think i'll make this spot my go-to place for wings but i wouldn't mind coming by again just to hang out with a good group of friends!"
"i'm very torn on this review. i generally am ok with the occasional buffalo wild wings and judge them based on the 75 cent wing cost. but this time was a bit different. my friends and i waited about 20 mins for a table which wasn't terrible being that it was a thursday night with a wing special in burbank. the first problem was that they tried to squeeze 5 of us in a booth, mind you 3 of us aren't exactly perfect 10 models and are between 2 and 300lbs depending on height. we asked for a table but they basically told us no so we adjusted, the 3 smallest on one side and 2 biggest on another. sure, it was a tight squeeze but we managed. our server came over and was a bit standoffish and took our order. we got chips con queso to start, then each got wings. i got spicy garlic and caribbean jerk boneless wings. they were pretty good but man did our service suck. just from our servers accent we could tell he was from the northeast, maybe boston or new york. and let me tell you, that attitude came with it. it's as if he was doing us a service for serving us. even when we asked for refills after having empty cups for a good 10 minutes it was as if we asked him to run 20 flights of stairs. i would say the food was 3.5 or 4 stars for the cost but the service was no more than 1 or 2 stars. he only got a 15% tip because of it and i'll probably stay away from this buffalo wild wings."
"typical buffalo wild wings. decent food and lots of television sets! our server was pretty good. food: typical wings at a buffalo wild wings. we ordered a bunch of everything as we watched the syracuse/michigan st. march madness matchup! service: our server was good and responsive. however, the television  sets that were showing the only ncaa game at the time somehow changed to a jazz music station during a critical moment in the game. it took about 5 minutes to get the channel back to the game! the worst was towards the end of the game, the television sets changed to nascar. when i mentioned the problem to an employee i was told that they don't know how to fix the problem. that sucked! i was there for the basketball game and i couldn't watch the last 6 minutes of the game because they couldn't change a single television set to cbs! pretty ridiculous if you ask me. regardless, i left and listened to the rest of the game on my radio on my way home! again... commercials don't show the tv sets changing on you in the middle of a game!ambiance: typical buffalo wild wings... only issue was that i had major issues watching my game! summary: i'll probably go back given that i know what to expect and i feel like the syracuse game malfunction was a one time thing (at least i hope). i just wish employees and management cared more about putting on major sporting events. if the television channel changes, put it back on or at least pretend to give a damn!"
"great wings, kalina is the best bartender she is always nice and funny. please if you guys visit her be nice to her. i'm happy that she's here. i come every wednesday no matter what and always looking forward to seeing her."
i don't like the fact they serve the wings in the paper plate. it's awfulwait time is always too longserver has high attitude all the time they are always busy gossiping each other instead of taking care of guests
"still trying to process the disrespect we experienced here last night. came here for a friends birthday dinner where he had made a reservation for our party of 10 and things were bad from the beginning. they refused to seat us unless our entire party was there even though most of us were already there and planned on ordering while the others got there. the host was being very rude and we were never notified that everyone in our party had to be there when we made the reservation. after some dispute they decided they would seat us. we ordered drinks & food while the others got there. things started off fine then when the 3 remaining in our party arrived, service was slow so 2 decided to order drinks at the bar & bring it back to the table. our waiter, ryan, made a huge deal over this saying how it was against their policy and how we put him at risk of getting fired blah blah blah. he brings over his 2 older supervisors who thought they were bouncers or something and they kicked out our 2 friends for ordering drinks at the bar and bringing it back causing a huge scene.as seen in the video i included, they even threatened to stop serving us and talked to us as if were kids or drunks rather than adults/paying customers. this has been the worst service & i will never be returning as they completely ruined my friend's birthday dinner. as the supervisors kicked out our friends, the waiter ryan even commented ""we can kick out whoever we want"" while serving us! when you visit a business you should expect some level of respect and not be treated with the poor manner in which we were. will be taking higher action to report the treatment we received from their staff and i advise others not to come here."
amazing service wings and waitress danielle  was so nice definitely recommend it. went on a monday night and was very happy
"i enjoy bww, but every time i have come to this location, it is the worst service. the server hardly checks on us, and doesn't know answers to questions about menu and beer. it takes hours to get in and out. and the food is expensive for what you get. but it's the slow service that makes me never want to come back."
"karissa was by far an amazing person and she really helped me and my boyfriend and his best friend. she gave us several different beers and things and helped us understand the new drinks and everything. so, karissa, was outstanding and made our day, she made sure we were happy with our food and made sure to check up on us all the time we really loved her and wanted to say thank you for everything. she was on top of everything and very funny and honest and outgoing, we will definitely come back to see her honestly. she is a great person. this is really far from our house but because of her we will definitely be coming back to this location just because of karissa, thank you girl and happy early birthday!!! have fun and just know your fabulous and me and my boyfriend really appreciate you."
"they completely changed the look of this place since the last time i have been here.came around brunch time about a week ago, so it hadn't gotten too busy quite yet. we were seated at a booth and it was blatantly obvious that the chain was bought out by pepsi when they only had pepsi related beverages to offer. there are screens everywhere you look displaying the games that are going on and had one section for the bar area and the other for the regular seating area.our server was nice as she explained the lunch deals and was quick to put our order in. i ended up getting a small size of boneless wings that come with two flavors and fries. i asked it for extra crispy fried and we waited to get our food. once it came, i was surprised how big the serving was for lunch and had my brother and boyfriend help me finish my food. the fries were crispy and the wings were too. i had gotten the honey bbq and the spicy garlic with the honey bbq being my favorite of the two."
"twice in a row we came here and experienced such a horrible service!! both times they messed up my order and took them forever to bring out the correct order. they seem to be rushing when putting in the order and act like they got it right, but once the food is out we are either missing items or the entire order is wrong! service needs big time improvement. not too long ago, one of our servers even yelled out the f word at the employee booth. not acceptable! there are kids and families in the establishment."
"i can't express how much i loved this guy! he was getting so much crap from really annoying people sitting next to us for absolutely nothing. this man helped us and the tables around us and never missed a beat. his customer service was excellent, going above and beyond expectations. kudos to you ryan"
by far this location is horrible always horrible service and a staff that doesn't care (including the managers) i was there with a group of friends and we were treated horribly with our server named rick from beginning to the end of the night terrible service. when taking our order spoke to us with attitude and disrespected us. towards the end of the night it was around 1:30 in the morning (they close at 2am) we were the only people there and we still haven't received our food. so we left and talked to a manger and he didn't seem to care. as we're leaving rick comes out slamming the door and starts cursing at us. he starts cursing at us how disrespectful is that. never again i'm going to this location.
"i went to this bww location with a group of my friends for a late dinner the other day, and man am i impressed. the food was delicious for a fair price (it was wing wednesday), the wait wasn't too bad, and our waiter was one of the best waiters i've ever encountered! his name was eli, and he was seriously so nice, so funny, and so attentive. and he said it was only his fourth day on the job! keep that boy, buffalo wild wings!! i ordered the $.75 wings - ten of them, half boneless medium hot and half bone-in buffalo seasoned. the boneless ones weren't the best, but the bone-in ones? oh my god. amazing. we also shared several baskets of cheese curds and fried pickles, which are always delicious, in my opinion. eli made sure we all had plenty of water to wash down our wings, and he came by our table several times to check up on us. he provided us with an ample supply of ranch sauce and carrots and celery throughout the meal as well, which really helps when six people are fighting over the ranch lol. my boyfriend, who does not usually like bww, even said his chicken sandwich was delicious - never thought i'd hear those words coming from his mouth! all in all, this is the best bww i've ever been to, and i can't wait to go again. i'm craving those buffalo seasoned wings already!"
"if you don't mind waiting for your take out order, to be seated, to get service, etc. then your experience will be ok. otherwise it's pretty frustrating. i've been here multiple times for dine in and take out and everything takes forever! the folks working here are very obviously not functioning seamlessly which makes it more awkward. people being outwardly jealous of others taking a break, arguing over who is doing what, telling each other to get out of their space, etc. i think each individual is trying their best but as a team ta not cohesive and it rubs off on the customer experience.as for the food, asian zing is my favorite. i didn't realize they sold sauces in the bottle for just about $5 each so on my last visit i just bought a bottle so we can make the wings ourselves and don't have to come back.parking can be tough. there are many public parking spaces in the garages or on the street but it gets pretty crowded!"
"omg! the wait for a table on game day, forget it!!it took about an hour to wait for a table by the bar!! people at this location is ruthless too, there was others waiting in the line for a bar table and some just go and grab tables from them! rude service sucks here waiters and staffs looks like they hate their jobit takes forever to even order drinks and food after waiting 45 mins and still no service even after waiting a whole hour for a table we left! and took our money to yard house! way better service but i have to say no one can beat bww wangggslove bww just not this location!"
"i enjoy this buffalo wild wings location. it's right next to the amc theatres, so we regularly come in for drinks before going to the movie. and, to be honest, bww has the best happy hour in town. very decent drinks for dirt cheap.the primary problem at bww is that the service is generally slow. i have never been to a bww location that has fast service lol. for this location, the only way we can ensure that we'll get our drinks in time to make our movie is to sit at the bar. even then, there is usually only one bartender with a full bar...that being said, the attitude of the staff has been very friendly here and i don't really have any other complaints.four out of five stars and recommended if you know that the service is slow ahead of time."
"the service: the service was good. staff was kind . the food : quality of the food was horrible!! my burger was so dry , the waitress recommended this burger , idk why .. it was a waste of money, only took one bite .  my boneless wings were super hard, almost broke of my bracket. the sauce was okay . overall experience: food was okay but over priced for what it was ."
"this review is a week and a half late. i thought i'd get over the terrible experience i had on the first sunday of football and i need to share in hopes you do not go through what i went through. it's almost like it was a prank show or something. i'm still upset since i wasn't able to get the rewards points and i check with my waiter 3 times to make sure and he said yes. i went to check my points today and it didn't go through, just points for checking in. my receipt didn't work because it didn't include the receipt number. so frustrating.my husband and his mom went to watch football and i came later after running some errands. when i arrived i was told that our waiter is not the brightest crayon in the box and that they have been waiting for a shake for the last 35 minutes. apparently, he screwed up. they ordered one of the ""b-dubs blenders,"" the ""chocolate cake blender"" and you know what he brought? he brought a chocolate cake, so they showed him the photo and and explained to him what it was. he was so confused and didn't understand, but he took back the slice of chocolate cake. about 40 minutes later someone else brought it. i wanted to order and waited and waited. finally as he was walking by a third time we flagged him down. apparently he's not very attentive to his customers. i'm looking at my receipt and his name is jarrell, by the way. if you get him as your waiter, run! or at least get another table with someone else. keep reading if you want to hear more...he finally got a pen out and started to take my order. it was very loud since everyone was cheering for their teams, so i decided if i point to what i want so there would be no mistake. i pointed to the ""4 naked tenders"" and then pointed to the ranch. i pointed to the side of mac and cheese and to drink the cucumber elderflower margarita (hand-shaken) with a glass with very little ice since my teeth are sensitive.he came by to put the drink on the table with ice packed to the brim (see photo), even the ice was falling on the table. i told him that i asked for a little ice this is way too much, can i get an empty cup? he never brought that, i ended up pouring most of the ice onto an empty tray.he dropped of the mac & cheese and my husbands food and walked away. we waited for 10 minutes. he passed by several times, but couldn't get his attention as i needed napkins and utensils. i flagged down someone else and they got it for us.he came by later with some crispy chicken tenders and i immediately stopped him and told him i ordered the naked tenders, which i proceeded to point to the photo again. it took about 15 minutes and i was just done. just the few items i ordered he couldn't get that right. it's almost as though he can't hear or see very well. like nothing works up there, as if he doesn't want to be here, you know?long story short, when it came time to get the bill i asked if i can give him my number so i can get the points. he said tell me the number, i asked if i can write it down and he said just tell me the number, so i did. when he came back i asked are you sure that went through? he said, ""you can check that next week."" but, i asked again, ""are you sure? we asked for a 'chocolate cake blender' shake and you brought a slice of chocolate cake. i asked for naked tenders and you brought 'crispy tenders.' how can i trust you got my number right?"" he just nodded his head and said, ""it's in.""today i tried to put in my receipt for the points and since we split the bill 3 ways, it didn't have the receipt number on it so i couldn't get the points for that day. bummer because i remember them saying double points for coming in for football, i did get points for checking in. in conclusion, avoid jarrell so you can have a better time than i did."
"wow this is the first thing that comes to mind, especially given the area my family and i were in. we just finished a movie next door and called to make a phone order bc we knew it was late. a gentleman by the name of marvin answered and lost the call after stating no more phone orders would be taken within 10 minutes of closing. it was 12:39 a.m. completely understandable but my order was small because my niece wanted some mozzarella sticks and my nephew wanted a small order of wings. i called back and lost the call again. called two other times and was at this point hung up on. i was literally next door and was attempting to cut time for both myself and the restaurant. i asked for the manager and stressed that i felt i was being blown off after calling 4 different times. her response verbatim... ""take my name and call corporate my name is b-r-i-t-t-a-n-y call corporate and do what you have to!"" she made sure to spell it out and when my family and i walked in they waited until 12:59 to serve us. marvin was the name of the individual who hung on me 4x. otto was the server who passed us and served 3 other parties before asking us for our order. it's just something else, don't come here if you want any type of courtesy.  i was just mind blown at the level of unprofessionalism. my family was visiting from out of town and i was completely embarrassed to say the least.  the irony is that the moment my order was placed in, it took less than five minutes to come out.  i am just saddened at the level of service. i will make it a point to let anyone i know visiting this area that there are numerous restaurants around the area that will treat you with common courtesy and make you feel welcomed."
"this place has to be the most poorly run bww i have ever been to. it always seems ridiculously under staffed and the amount of people waiting to the empty seats available ratio is very upsetting. the staff seems to all be talking and watching the game more than actually helping people and getting food out. the fries are always cold also. last week my husband and i ordered two medium sized orders of wings to go with a caesar salad on the side, and when we got our food we only had one order of wings and the salad was disgusting. wilted lettuce, freezing cold bread (we only like 5 mins away so it shouldn't have been that cold), and no caesar dressing. this place needs new management asap !"
good service and good place to watch game. not my kind of place but i won't knock them for that. drinks were good and very reasonably priced. mozzarella sticks were good. street tacos were also good by be warned there's a lot of spicy sauce on them. hubby liked wings. i thought they were fair.
"if you want to barf all day then come here. only one server was here and my order was completely incorrect. after waiting for 1hr and 15 mins for my food to come out it was cold and chicken. i ordered pork street tacos. needless to say i won't be spending my money here ever again. hire more staff, clean up, don't let your place of business smell like an outdoor toilet. make sure your menus don't smell like a toddler pooped on all of them and just be better. this was disgusting. i wouldn't be surprised if i got aids after sitting at this place."
"have gotten take out a few times and dined in once. take out orders were fine and had no issue with that. however when i dined in with my friends our experience was terrible.it was thursday may 31 around 10:30pm when we were seated. it was not the busiest i've seen them. i would say half the place was full since the nba finals were over already. the vibe at first was good, but everything went downhill fast. i have no idea what happened, but our server's attitude completely changed out of nowhere. suddenly it felt like my group and i were inconveniencing them, which made the entire visit uncomfortable. issues: 1. order came out wrong for a friend. they ordered wet wings, but they didnt come out that way. so she kindly asks if they can make them the way she requested. server says i can give you the sauce on the side because our kitchen is swamped. i get it your kitchen is swamped, but if that is the way the customer ordered it then it should be fixed.2. very unattentive. our server constantly forgot several requests. my friend had to ask for her ranch about 4 times and didnt get it until 30 minutes later. we had to ask for water 3 times and only got it towards the end of our meal. napkins were never provided and were finally provided after asking 3 times. also had to ask for to go boxes and our bill twice. each time we had to hunt down our server cause it seemed like he was avoiding our table. we weren't being rude at all, we said thank you and asked politely so i'm not sure if he was just having a bad day or what happened but that's just unacceptable to forget that many things. 3. drinks were horrible. not sure who the bartender was but i ordered a lemon drop and it tasted like lemonade. my friend's jack and coke tasted like watered down coke. my friend got a second jack and coke, which was worse than the first. we address our dislike to our server and he tells us to talk to employees working in the bar. not sure why we have to do this, but we went over there and let the bartender know. we ask if they could remake the drink or take the drink off the tab as it was barely touched. the bartender is rude and says ""i can't do that, but what you can do is order another one and see if you like that one"". wtf...i have never got a response like that when not liking something. he kept saying sorry afterwards, which just annoying cause i knew he didnt mean it. this whole experience will make me never come back to this location. i like bww, but not this place. avoid if you can."
"i was in the area and decided to stop by to have a few drinks before watching a movie. shawn was our bartender for the time being of our first quick visit. he was friendly and attentive.after our movie had ended, we decided to stop by again to have some food and drinks. we were given great service by noemi who was our bartender this evening. noemi provided us great service and was more than happy to conversate with us in between tasks. she truly has mastered the skill of multi-tasking. this place is in good hands with staff members like herself who are not only attentive but provide grade a customer service. my friends and i will make sure to visit this place again because of her. thanks again noemi. you are the real mvp!visit took place on 6/24/2018."
"on a friday a little before 3pm. labor day weekend or not, lol you need staff. i should have looked up the reviews before i walked in. we are seated in the top tables i cannot remember their reasoning. he asked our drink. no utensils or napkins brought in the mean time. our appetizer arrives, still no napkins. our order is taken. one of the three was wrong. we are ready to ask for our check & a box. one dude running drunks in a red jersey just bothered me seeing him touch his hair & tightening his pony tail. we ask for our check. we wait, as i saw it isn't going anywhere i ask what seems to be a manger for my check. another approaches us with the check, then asked how we got it. i responded with, i had to get up & ask someone else for it. mind you my parking was validated, still paid over $13, all because of bww slow service."
"this has been probably my worst experience at a restaurant. i am a very patient person but this was just ridiculous. my two cousins and i came in around 12:00 a.m. on a friday night. it wasn't too busy. we sat down at the bar area because that was the only seating available. it took 10 minutes for a waiter to approach us and give us menus. we ordered our drinks and fried pickles. the drinks came out right away and then we ordered our wings at the time the waiter brought the drinks out. 20 minutes goes by and we still haven't gotten the fried pickles. our cups were empty and the waiter was no where to be found. after 30 minutes, our waiter comes out with our fried pickles and drops them off on our table without saying anything as if he was in a rush or something. the fried pickles were absolutely horrible by the way. our cups were still empty. keep in mind, there were only 6 other tables that had people on them while there were at least 10 waiters/waitresses. after waiting for about 50 minutes since we ordered our wings, my cousins and i were staring down the waiter who was casually talking to a coworker that was off his shift. he made eye contact with us then gave a dirty look then went into the kitchen to grab our wings. by the way, we only ordered 1 order of traditional large wings which is only 18 pieces of chicken. once he brought them out, i asked him in a jokingly tone, ""are the wings cold by now?"" and then he looked at me and proceeded to tell me that the kitchen was backed up and that's why it took so long. it was 1:00 a.m. at this point and there was a table with two people at it in the entire restaurant. 5 customers.. how are you going to tell me that the kitchen is backed up when there are only 5 customers in the entire restaurant. there was more staff than customers. we ate the wings which were actually delicious. our drinks were still empty though. as we're eating, the waiter walks by and drops the check off without even saying anything. he clearly wanted to be out of the restaurant so he wanted us to rush. we finally finished and paid and walked out. i said 'thank you' to the waiter and he responded with an attitude. i have never complained about service or food. i'm a very relaxed person and usually am accepting of situations. i respect waiters and waitresses but this time i was so angry. it took 50 minutes to prepare 18 wings. and what pissed me off most was that the waiter didn't even apologize for the delay. he never said one thing. i am very ashamed of buffalo wild wings. i will not be coming back anytime soon."
honestly the worst buffalo wild wings location! a bunch of awful staff that barely acknowledge you. food is still good but it's really an awful experience even for pick up. your constantly waiting around. service just flat out sucks! i also live next to this location and this used to be my favorite restaurant. go to northridge location it's more welcoming.
"admittedly, the biggest downside to this location is something they don't really have control over: parking. the lot at the sherman oaks galleria is an absolute nightmare. tiny spots mixed with horrible parkers means you're either going to have to squeeze into a spot or circle round and round trying to find somewhere to park. the employees at this location are all very friendly and helpful. and the food is on par with all other locations. to that, i'm happy. however, the location is a lot smaller than others so that means a chain that already is notorious for long wait times is going to be amplified even more here. best to come here on a random weekday night. either that or just come early understanding that you're going to be waiting around for awhile."
"the worst customer service ever. the wait is long, the order takes long, the food takes long, even the god damn receipt takes loong. why??? like what the hell. they went raise the chickens, then kill them, then boil them, they fry them and and finally they serve it to you. as for the receipt, my wife said they went to the bank to charge your card. can you god damn believe it????"
"i had the worst experience ever at this location! food was brought to us cold, it took forever to get our drinks and they smelled and tasted bad and the server had no idea of what they sell and was poorly trained in customer service. i asked to speak to the manager 15 min went by and no one came to our table then the server returns and asked if he can get us anything else!?? "" i said, your manager!"" then minutes later a guy finally comes to our table and asked what was wrong. i was so disappointed not only about the food and drinks but the overall customer service at this location, what was supposed to be a fun night out with my wife and turned out to be disappointment and on top of all both my wife and i ended up throwing up as soon we got home. thanks for ruining our night!"
hey bww? maybe during sundays when your wait line is a mile long and tables clear up you have your staff clear off and then seat people?! i stood there for 14 minutes watching table after table clear up and stay dirty while the waiting area is growing and growing. rage balls!!
"don't come here unless you don't mind waiting 30-45 minutes for your food. my boyfriend and i just wanted to split a small size of wings before seeing a movie at the arc light. 8t took 20 minutes for someone to take our order, and then another 30-45 for nine wings to get to our table. sorry that we didn't order a shit-ton of food or any alcohol, clearly the table behind us that did is higher on your priority list because they got their food 15 minutes after they ordered. the only one who ever checked in with us was one of the bar tenders that could see that we had been waiting a long time. never again, but best wishes to the bar tender that was the only decent human there."
lunch date with my husband !!! the place was empty just the way we like things. our waiter was nice and answered all our newbie questions about the sauces. over all the wings were tasty and delicious the fried pickles were yummy. they have sculpin ipa on tap and my husband enjoyed his 805.
"i waited 45 minutes for my to go order just for it to be pulled out of the warmer because it had been in there the entire time. wings were soggy and sauce was dried out by that point, and i wasn't about to wait forever for new ones, so i just took them.the hostess took care of me when i first came in and didn't bother to check for the wings but told me they'd ""be ready soon."" when the to go counter person got there 45 minutes later, she said, ""i tried to tell her."" so apparently she knew my order was there and had me waiting that long?"
update: the happy hour here is not very good. i asked the bartender why it was so different and more expensive than the burbank bww... burbank is a franchise and sherman oaks is a corporate-owned location.  all i can say is booooooo bww corporate!  i won't return for happy hour here again. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3
this place sucks. horrible service. worst bww.servers do not help you at all. took 20 minutes to get water! drinks came 20 mins after the food!!! for being a sports bar you would think they coordinate for sport events but they didn't have enough servers so half of the place was closed. will not return to this bww!
"the only thing buffalo wild wings really have going for them is the sports entertainment. i enjoy wings, but when i feel that it is not sanitary or the service is not good, i enjoy it very much less. my friends and i came here on a sunday night for wings and it was nearly a full house, but most tables had an empty table without food. the service is meh, it wasn't bad but also was not the greatest. when the server made a mistake on our order, he claimed he did not make a mistake. and honestly, who really orders boneless wings ( lol). it is very loud so you can barley talk to your friends. i've been to many restaurants that also offer sports entertainment and they're not even that loud!! i don't know if i'll ever really come to get wings unless i am forced to!!! ( also, my friend who is a regular claimed his wings weren't so good that evening)."
"my favorite buffalo wild wings! i have been to different ones and no one can top you guys! you all are very nice and very patient. everything always fresh, warm and tasty. worth every penny. i also want to thank bryan that is very nice and patient with our request and needs. it's a friday and i had a long day and you were nice enough to deal with my self when i know i kept forgetting things. you went above and beyond! thank you bryan! thank you bww staff!"
"employees are super rude, nowhere to be found, and seem to hate their job.kitchen is always so slow and food takes forever to come out.flavor of wings aren't too bad, i liked the asian zing"
"the food was amazing but our server in the bar area was absolutely terrible. wasn't refilling our waters. when we asked her for refills she acted as if she was being bothered. she brought out the fries that we ordered loaded and they were plain. when we reminded her that we ordered loaded, she seemed irritated that we wanted our correct order. she returned with the same fries but you could tell she just threw bacon bits and a small amount of cheese on it. the fries weren't loaded just simply topped. terrible service"
"only come here for boneless mango habanero wings! or are they considered tenders? mango habanero is extremely hot, don't let it touch your lips.happy hour is my favorite and starts at 9pm till closing time.. i love the mozzarella sticks, fried pickles, mini corn dogs, $3.95 beers, $2.95 magaritas, and $4.95 coronitas. service is a-okay.. does take a while to get your order in/out. the wait is long, but if you go and find a spot in the bar area you don't have to wait. nice spot to chill, grab some food and wings and watch sports on the huge tv's.parking is a hassle, so beware."
"can't go wrong with buffalo wild wings. this location in particular is pretty clean but usually busy, especially when any game is playing.there's always specials and good happy hours going on. we came for dinner on a wednesday, and wings were only 75 cents each. late night happy hour started at 9pm too. if you're indecisive with wings you can always get them dry and get the sauces on the side, it ensures the wings stay crispy too. also experiment mixing dry rubs and sauces. i enjoy salt & vinegar dry rub with regular hot sauce.also, expect a long wait on salads with chicken. it takes a while to grill the chicken."
"i was never really a fan of buffalo wild wings, but i thought it was just the location that i usually go to.  i guess it really is just bww in general.  it took forever for the food to come, and when it did, it was luke warm at best and our wings were barely covered in sauce.  they also got my order wrong but at that point i was so hungry that i didn't want to wait for them to remake it.  we came in late on a friday night, around 10:30 pm.  it wasn't too crowded, but there was still a good amount of people still there.  we ordered the mini corn dogs, some fries, and then i ordered small boneless chicken wings in medium sauce.  the corn dogs came out first, and they were okay.  they weren't extremely hot, but i don't think it was really anything to raise any flags yet.  then, the fries and the wings came.  the first thing i noticed was that my wings were labeled mild instead of medium.  it's not too big of a deal, and i was just way too hungry to care at that point.  but then i took a look at the actual chicken wings, and the sauce was just barely coating the chicken, which led to them being pretty dry and at that point i was just eating them just so that i don't starve to death.  they were also borderline cold like they had been sitting out in the open for too long, which makes no sense because it took so long for them to come out.  i thought that they were just making everything to order for it to take that long, but it seems to me like they made it a long time ago and just set them out for a while and then just tossed the wings in with the sauce.  the fries were just weird to me.  the first few fries were also borderline cold.  but then i got to the fries in the middle and they were slightly warmer.  this inconsistency was just weird to me.  what i did like though was that we got the basket of fries at the happy hour price and it was actually a lot of fries, it could easily feed two people.   i was extremely disappointed with this place.  it wasn't so much our server's fault because they were actually good and i know they're trying their best, but my issue is with whatever's going on in the back.  taking way too long only to get cold food?  no thanks."
"just received the fastest best service to get my food. sat down at bar and was instantly greeted. had food and beverage in front of me within 5mins. hot,fresh and crispy. exactly how i like it!"
"my family and i decided to all have dinner together so this was the spot we decided to come to. we came on a tuesday night and we knew it would be awhile because they have their specials on tuesdays and we were a party of 7. upon arrival we were quoted 30-40 minutes which was decent for our party size. it was fairly busy & a lot of people seemed to not be getting their food yet, which meant it would take longer for us to get seated. after an hour, we luckily were able to squeeze into a booth which said would fit 6 people but we had 4 big guys so it was very tight and also a seat at the end. we sucked it up because we were starving. we ordered wings right away & their tuesday specials for wings for snack & small size are bogo free. we ordered 4 small sizes of the wings which each come with 9 pieces and since it's bogo we got 18 wings x 4 small size and up to 4 flavors! definitely took advantage of that deal! we also ordered other sides and drinks too, and i'm happy that our food came out less than 10 minutes of ordering. downside it took awhile for our alcohol drinks to come out and my margarita tasted like juice, but oh well! wings are my go to comfort food, service was pretty decent on my recent visit. my family also told them it was my bday and they gave me a chocolate cake with ice cream and oh man was that delicious!! although the wait can tend to be long & it gets packed here all the time, their deals are worth the wait!"
ivy was my server and she was amazing . funny and very nice she brought my food out on time . the food was good not great but the service definitely will having me coming back .
"sorely disappointed.  while they have many tvs, parking is extremely limited and our food was overdone and/or cold.  even after the waitress finally came around and we asked for the food to be replaced, to which she replied, ""is it cold?"" (leading me to believe this is a normal issue), the reordered food was cold. i will not be visiting again."
"seeing that there was a dodger/laker game and being a friday night, i came here knowing there would be a wait. but to my surprise i found one table open at the bar. even tho we got seated right away with service and all we still didn't get out of there for two hours, not because we were watching the game but because of how long it took for our food and drinks. it does take a long time but i get it, it was busy and there was a game on. marlon was at least nice enough to give us a heads up when he said the bar was backed up and when our food was almost ready. i had accidentally gotten sauce all over my sweater and when marlon notice me trying to wipe it off he came to bring me a wet paper towel. the food is just typical bar food so you can't expect too much. wings and wedges...you can't really mess that up. i come here mostly for the games. or cheap drinks when it's happy hour."
"came here with my sil.  i like the atmosphere, you can't beat fatty food and sports games on the big screens.  service was fine, and the food was just okay.  sigh, but hey- if you drink enough beer, the food will taste better!  haha!"
"buffalo wild wings, the entrance displayed some of the great inspirational athletes on their wall, sports memorabilia, casual and relaxed atmosphere lots of televisions everywhere.  nice decor, appears to be a nice hangout place.  our experience on the hand was another story.  this is the most unsatisfying lunch we've ever had in a long time, not to mention the service was lousy.  we waited 10 minutes just to get the menu and it's not as if the place is busy, the main dining area was nearly empty.  we ordered:the buffalo chicken salad- the greens are so dry inedible while the tomatoes were so soggy...yuck! chicken buffalito - chicken was dry and blandsadly our dining experience was less than par.  ambiance: nice hangout placewaitstaff: needs improvement food: do not order the salad / maybe this place is only good for their buffalo wings?!?i don't recommended this place nor will we come back here."
went there today. very fast service. our waitress summer was the best. i will definitely be back.
"anyone that knows me knows that i absolutely love chicken wings.  i love them so much i can probably eat them every single day of the week.  with that being said, bww is one of those places that i crave or like coming to pretty often to get my wing fix, however there are two things that take away from this place.  the first thing being that the wait to be seated, even at the self serve bar, can be ridiculous during the weekend or a bigger sports game.  i get it, people want to eat wings and watch the game but the waits can be insanely long, and i think the second thing that hinders this place is point number two.  the second thing being that service is pretty darn bad and slow here.  i know it's crowded but man sometimes its just an another level of slow; it feels like they are killing the chickens in the back and starting from scratch.  however, i honestly like coming here! they have great sauces for the wings, great happy hour prices, and a good lunch special that wont break the bank.  even though it has its flows it does not stop me from coming here, but people should definitely be warned about the wait time and slow service."
"i have been to this location a few times and each time i wasn't amazed. the parking lot is so small for a place that typically is busy especially during game days. the service is usually slow and the food is just okay nothing to amazing. since i've been to both lunch and dinner prices i will be honest and say the food is not worth the dinner price. this is a good place for lunch though (if you aren't in a hurry). my favorite sauce is asian zing! i am not a big fan of their mild, it doesn't taste like anything to me. perks to this place and reason behind the 3 stars is:2 stars for the wing size, their wing size here is nicely portioned and one more star for the variety of sauces offered."
"came here on my birthday, food was alright service was alright, there was a 45 minute wait which is normal but luckily it was just me and my friend so we grabbed a seat at the bar."
"for a friday night and a party if 7 we got seated immediately. parking is available in the banks lot after 4  which is always great, plus it's free. the. food is good, not great. the prices are a little expensive for wings.five bone in, or traditional wings for 8.49 is not that good of a deal."
"my go to spot for wings!mango habanero and salt & vinegar are my two faves. wednesday's are 75cent wings. honestly it's the only time i'd really go. menu is pretty expensive for wings.happy hour is 4-6 and there's late hh starting at 10.if there's a wait, check out the bar area for any available seating."
"where do i start! we love bwws, the micheladas are amazing! the wings are finger licking good. it used to be our go to for datenight but we recently started ordering to eat at home while watching a movie."
"this is by far the worst restaurant i have ever entered. we were told our wait time was 30 minutes and waited over 40 minutes to be seated. what got me really upset was that fact that there were plenty of tables that just sat uncleared for so long as we waited.very hungry at this point we sat our table eager to order food and eat. as we waited for our server to arrive i noticed that our table was very dirty and poorly cleaned. i looked around and it was if they just put no effort in sanitizing our table. sticky table , wet seats and i looked on the floor and found so much filth as if they don't clean !i asked to speak to a manager. when manager ""miguel s."" approached us he didn't bother relocating us but simply said ""i can sweep and clean it up"". frustrated at this point i told the manager ""miguel s."" we we're leaving because i was disappointed and disgusted how management ran the  front of house and if that's how they managed they're front of house i can only imagine how their back of how's and kitchen manages and serves they're food!"
"this place suckssssss! every location we go to just sucks as bad as the last one! idk why people drop money here, i'm not big on wings but my bf and i come to have drinks and chill. all the waitress are ridiculously rude, un attentive, and really spicy! i hate asking for a refill, extra sauce or ranch because you'll never see them again till it's time to collect. i think little cesars has better service than this, tbh i feel like when i come here it's like an adult version of chunky cheese, the place always has a funky smell, the service sucks, but people still come just to get out the house"
"been coming here for a year and today was the 3rd and final time this happens to us. today is a wednesday, it wasn't busy, and we sat there waiting for 30 minutes and not once did they ask us for our drinks, if we were ready, nothing. multiple servers passed by us and nothing. 2 servers, one which i think is a team leader, kept looking at us and were just laughing and joking around and neither bothered to ask us anything. one of the employees, a black female, was just walking around playing with another employee's hair and drinking soda. the final straw was when another couple sat down near us, and right away they were attended. we just got our stuff and walked out.terrible experience. like i mentioned before, this is the 3rd time this happens. this is final straw and we won't be returning to this bww again. we will be taking our business to the bww in lakewood, since we have never had an issue there."
i went to this location yesterday with a group of 6. it didn't take us long to get seated for a friday night. i ordered a blue hawaiian drink (the bottom is what i ordered) and the top is what they gave me (see picture) it tasted like a alcohol free milkshake. i had to give it back. it took over an hour to get our food and when we finally got it all of thr food was cold so we had to ask for a fresh batch. the table across from us complained about their food taking long and the waiter said it's only been 20 minutes. she had to prove to him on her phone that she's also been waiting over an hour. we should of went somewhere else.
"45 minutes to be seated.flagged a waiter down 15 minutes after being seated for just the drink order. after thirty minutes asked about the food order and low and behold it appears.  some of the food wasn't hot like the rest,  as if it had been under a heat lamp.   we love the wings but wont come back to this one again."
thanks alex your service was great.. i will definitely be coming back and asking for you... if the manager ana marie is still here at this location and could see this post i would put alex as employee of the month..
nooooooo!! just baaad service!! sad cuz my son looooves there wings and there blazing hot sauce!
"upon entry, it was suggested we try the bar... not a seat in sight. the chicken was dry, our potato wedges never arrived, and the server seemed uninterested in serving us. at the end, he didn't even bring us the box we asked for"
fuck man! we got here and placed our order 45 minutes ago!!! we ordered a medium wings and corn dogs..... it's not busy so why is it taking so long to get our food?!!!! the service sucks here!!!!!!
"terrible hospitality, rude waitress, and dirty windows. i usually never come to bww because of bad experiences. i waited two years before i came back because i was gifted a few gift cards. none the less this place still isn't up to par. food is decent, service is sad. not a place to have a quality time with people you care about. never again buffalo."
"i was really upset that i could not eat here because their dinning room was  closed due to a fight where they are charging $25 to dine in.plus, yelp says there is a 0 minute wait time when i was told 25 mins to dine outside."
"it's hard to find words to describe how bad a restaurant could really be until you walk into this grimy, dark, obnoxiously loud and pathetic excuse of a restaurant known as buffalo wild wings in downey. the first impressions of the restaurant are quite sorry. my family and i happened to be in the area and unfortunately this sorry excuse of a restaurant was the nearest location to us for wings. from the moment you walk in, the music was distastefully blaring, which for one made it very difficult for anyone to have a decent conversation. i walked up to the podium to put our name down to be seated and the music was so loud that it was a struggle to even tell the hostess my name and for how many, that i had to show her how many with a hand count and she just had us wait on the side. shortly after we were seated, and as we were walking to be seated, the floors were uncleaned and dirty. right before we were seated, i asked the hostess if the music was always that loud and she stated that unfortunately it is and i asked if she could turn it down. shortly after it was turned down, but for some reason someone thought it was a good idea to turn it up like we were at some night club. the waiters and waitresses looked like they all hated their jobs and could not wait to leave their jobs. we went through a couple waiters and i hate to say it, but they were very sorry with their sour attitudes and demeanors. rule of thumb for any establishment is that when you have a family of 6 waiting to eat who are there to spend a good amount of money and receive good service, should and can tip generously, however this was not the case. our waiters would disappear, didn't attend to us, and we needed to ask for things. it was an all around terrible experience. the food was okay, not as good as some other locations. my recommendation, is to stay far and clear from this location, unless you enjoy mediocre service and food. not to mention eating your food in a grimy setting without having the ability to have a decent conversation with your company."
"this location is disgusting, not attentive and stingy all in one.don't waste your time unless you like receiving chicken claws with your order along with a waitress who gets your order wrong and forgets to bring your drink but tries to charge you for it."
"yes keep the 4 cents kristina. i had the worst service today! all other staff was friendly and helpful and she was nowhere to be found. i couldn't even get her to get me napkins, top or drinks or get forks when my food came. then she had the nerve to ask if we wanted our change back when we paid. super rude. she didn't give me my coin back just the dollar amount  poor service here on 08/04/18"
this a great place to eat on happy hour and great beer selection also great boneless wings special on thursday bartender was awesome and always checking up if i need something else. mix drinks are great too. great atmosphere. great mixture of music recent to 80 music.
great food great atmasfear. love the service and the beer is always cold. love coming back and will always come back
"came to grab a quick bite while my car was being serviced. i got my usual. roasted garlic mushrooms, small flats mango habanero. fries were soft, not crispy. wings were cold. not coming back to this bww."
great place to come if you like to wait at a table for 20 mins for service while everyone stands around. services walking by see you still have menus and no drinks. still no one comes and ask if you been helped worst serve ever
"i guess the only reason we keep coming back here is because their wings are really good if you get them fresh. im not one to give a bad review based off just one time because i like to give people/places the benefit of the doubt- bad day, off time, whatever. but the service here is usually always pretty terrible. it's a busy night- there's tons of employees just standing around not doing anything or on their cell phone. it always takes a long while to get your food, they don't really check on us for anything else so we have to end up flagging down a different server that ends up getting annoyed at that fact. moral of the story- come here with lots of patience"
"not sure but perhaps you have to specify at this location about appetizers. typically, an appetizer comes out first-5 or 10 minutes before the meal. the idea behind an appetizer is that it's a small dish that wakes up your appetite for the main course.well, when i was there this past saturday night, it didn't quite work out this way. my fried pickle appetizer was delivered at the exact same time as my medium wings. i could tell they had both sat in the window for a while because the pickles were just warm and the wings had sauce that had dried and congealed on them. not ideal. i really should've sent the pickles back but i was starving.is there anything worse than someone telling you to smile? i think not. however as much as i dislike that, i also dislike eating somewhere where not a single person in the staff gives you a warm or welcoming smile at any point during your experience. from the host to the bartender that served me-everyone seemed miserable. no one was rude or mean but this place has an ""all business"" attitude. it all felt very transactional and there was not the type of engagement or interaction that you usually get at restaurant when they want your business."
"i never got seated i got to this location at about 9:50pm and put my name down on the waiting list to be seated and the guy told us it was about an hour wait and we where cool with that. i told the guy at the front desk that my party and i would be waiting at bar. i went to check several times and all they would tell me is that it would be a ten minute wait. they would seat people coming in but not us and at about 12:25am i went to the front desk for the last time and all they said was if i still wanted to be seated. they forgot about seating us even though i would go check multiple times. im never coming back to this place, they didn't want to sever me and my party"
worst. nfl. game. day. experience.45-minute wait for draught beers.  they ran out of wings at 10:47 am.  let me reiterate: buffalo wild wings ran out of wings at 10:47 am.
"i love the food at bww. you can't go wrong with wings and fries. all of the sauces i've tried are great! my favorites are probably the medium, garlic parm and lemon pepper. their service at this location is soooo slow though. we walked in around 8 pm on a sunday and the place was pretty dead. so many empty tables. i told the host we had a party of 2, and he goes, ""it's a 20 minute wait right now."" i looked at the empty tables all around and he says in a hurry, ""there's no wait if you sit in the bar area.""  so we went to sit in the bar area, and didn't get paid any attention to for about 25 minutes. took another 30 mins to get our food after we ordered. food was delish, but the service really needs to pick up the pace."
"this bww location actually deserves zero stars from me. the bf and i walked in sunday evening around 7pm after hitting up the driving range. we were in the mood for wings and bww was down the street. so, why not? we were greeted at the door and told the hosts that we would be sitting at the bar. as we made our way to the bar, i noticed that there were quite a few empty tables that could have easily accommodated all the families that were waiting to be seated. maybe they're short staffed? we were going to grab seats at the actual bar but decided against it as the bar was dirty i.e. dirty dishes and chicken bones left behind by the previous patrons, used napkins, food stains and water marks from the bottoms of glasses on the counter. the only spot we found decent enough to sit at was at the end of the long table in front of the bar. even so, the spot we were sitting at was still a little dirty. it was sticky to the touch so i had to grab some wet naps from an empty table across from us. we sat for maybe 10 minutes and we weren't acknowledged by any bww staff. who and where was our server?? so, the bf walked up to the bar to order a beer while i had to get up (again) and grab a menu from another table because we didn't have anything. it only took me about 5 minutes to figure out what to order and still, no server. at this point, i should've listened to my inner voice telling me to just leave this place because we weren't getting any service. while debating whether to stay or go, our server finally comes but she didn't introduce herself. she just walked by our table and said that she would be right with us. ok? after waiting for a total of 22 minutes, server comes back and asks us what we'd like to drink. drink? we're ready to eat! after making us wait, my bf already got his own drink from the bar! -_-  we ordered a small traditional wings and a water for me. when she came back with my water, she just set my water cup down on our table without saying anything and walked off. umm rude. thankfully, we didn't wait long for our wings to arrive but when we got it, it looked sloppy and unappetizing! the sauce from the spicy garlic wings was smeared on the side of the carton. ugh! we weren't trying to be difficult customers so we ate the wings anyways even though we could've easily complained. we ate the wings in no time at all and i was so irritated that i just wanted to get the hell out of there. when our server came back to check on us, i asked for the check and she came back right away with it. wow...our check came quicker than the service we received!i work in the food and beverage industry and i know that customer service is of utmost importance. if you're short staffed or busy tending to patrons, at least acknowledge your newly seated patrons with a friendly greeting. therefore, this bww location gets zero stars....dirty tables, absolute lack of customer service and inattentive staff. we should've left when we had the chance. totally regretted it. needless to say, we won't be back here again."
never a dull moment when we eat here. the food is always good and i like the music they play. we tend to hit the end of happy hour just before it's over because it's less crowded. (you're welcome for this tip ;) so we keeping it real right?! soooo the drinks here aren't that great. i'm not sure if it's cheaper alcohol or the drink selections are that great. but i didn't care for the few drinks i ordered. so ima keep it cute next time and order simple. (lol) for the wings they have this new flavor asian something but it's sweet and spicy which is amazing i also had the teriyaki wings as well. this place is adequate for bar food and chill vibes.
"5 stars if you don't care about the quality of your food or service. we waited 15 mins for a host to show to sit us but one never came. so we finally sat ourselves in the dirty bar area. and again waited even longer for someone to finally come and clean the table we were at. our orders were wrong and some food was cold. almost as if the wings were made first then left out until the other food finished. leaving the wings to taste cold and plasticity. the other good we order was so extremely over cooked. basically if it's, burnt then the cooks think it's good to go! can't believe we waited over an hour for the worst food."
"the food was good i had no issues with my order.. only complaint was i waited damn near half hour for 12 wings on my take out order the excuse was that they never have boneless wings ready .. not to mention it is a monday night at 10:25pm the place was nearly empty. go figure. even the hostess noticed i had been waiting for ever, if it wasn't for her i'd probably be still waiting. the wait was just unexpected."
"not sure what all the bead reviews are about, went to buffalo wild wings last night to watch the pittsburgh tampa bay game . food is great service is good plenty of tvs . had a good time we'll be back they have a nice $5 good-sized burger and fries you can't beat"
"the one star is for the mini corn dogs that i have an obsession with.  other than that, this place has terrible service. at least 70% of the staff here should be fired, as they spend most of their time socializing with one another. it's cute to watch them flirt with one another and casually stay by the register for 5-10 minutes at a time, but it's frustrating when you you have to ask several people for a water, for your food, and for your bill. i mean come on, rule number 1 to waitressing is to never make people wait for their bill. the managers are in the kitchen in a meeting while i'm sitting here watching the servers run amuck. the organization here is horrendous and ineffective. where's bar rescue???"
"i attend this location often, use to at least. after informing the personnel who manage this location about the dissatisfactory experience we had a few weeks ago and not receiving a response, i'll update my review to 1 star. a lower rating option is not available. one thing is not being able to attend your customer's on a day where you're location isn't anywhere near capacity. what i disliked the most is not receiving a response from the team who manages this location. i will take my business elsewhere."
"absolutely love bww but this location has the worst customer service!! had to constantly ask for straws, napkins, refills, utensils, condiments and the tab!! let's just say i will not be returning and wound not recommend this location to anyone."
"if i could give 0 stars i would. ordered to go 10 pcs. boneless wing's veggies side and ranch online takeout for 10. simplewe got there at 10:10,.to go parking all full, didn't really care except there were people on break in their cars apparently in those spots.that was warning #1went in, went to take out window, waited for someone to arrive, paid for order. lady (who was pleasant) said let me go check on your order......never to be seen again.eventually, i went to ask if someone could find her, and an old man in a suit said i don't really work here i'm security. he went to the back and came back 15 minutes later with a few waitresses with bags.she ask d my name said ""yep this one is yours"", only it wasn't.i asked for the missing items and she said ""oh did you want that? i'll go get you some"". i said well i paid for it so yes i would like it. ""i'll be right back"". i said i have my kids in the car just forget it"". and she said ""whatever"" as i walked out.i saw there was no napkins and looked around and didn't want to ask any more people there for anything and just left.if this is a franchise i hope the owner reads this, good customers service goes a long way, ans i'm a patient person.i hope others will choose another option. bwwlistens.com"
"so after a long days work i thought i'd have some winnngsss and buffalo wild wiinnngggss and when we sat down at the bar the nice gentlemen comes up to us and says the following . ""our fryers aren't working so we can't make any wings , fries , tenders , or anything else that involves fryers "" how sad that a place that only makes wings doesn't have a back up plan to plan for these kinds of situations . even after past bad experiences we decided to give this place another try and once again we weee disappointed . we were celebrating my brothers 25th anniversary as well with a group of 15 friends . we will be taking our business further to delamo mall bww."
"this bww is just like any other chain--long waits for food, hit or miss service, great wings.whether i come with a small group, friends, or family, i've always been lucky to have ever waited too long to be seated. service is really hit or miss, sometimes my server is super friendly and always checks in on us, and others i'll have servers that ghost us once we ordered and when they put down the food.i personally think that bww is only worth it when you come during their specials as i feel like their prices can be high for certain things."
"i've been to different locations, and the service here is by far the slowest. we waited more than an hour after we ordered our food!!!! wings are wings! nothing fancy! omgnever again!!!!!!"
"got here 9:35 with my other 5 friends (we were 6 total) they sent us close to the bar for due to ""spacing"" when we had clearly seen 2 empty 6 chair tables! then the waiter at the end section contradicted the host saying we couldn't be thereso they sent us to middle area where another waiter said to send us somewhere else!! is this customer service? we've been to other buffalo wild wings and never had this problem before! so then we decided to go back to the seats at the entrance and wait while no oneeeee could come and tell us any updatefinally we decided to just leave since the place isn't even packed and waiters seem to not want to attend any more customers."
"gave it a one star rating only because it wouldn't let me give it a 0 star rating. the first & only time i attended this location after 10pm everything sucked. the wait time was about 30 minutes, after waiting we got our table. we ordered 4 beers & appetizers first. took our server 20 minutes to bring our beer. we placed our order after getting our drinks. 45 minute wait & out appetizers arrived with our food. wings were stale, dry & cold!!!! appetizers were cold also! i can go on & on about my experience here but its just way to much to complain about. management here is terrible. mcdonalds has better managements than this place & that's being completely honest!!! bww im very disappointed by the way they handled my complaint!!! sorry not sorry!"
"wanted to catch the dodger opener game and my date and brother decided on this place, like what can possibly go wrong. parking is in a big mall don't really see anyone encountering problems atleast to parking.service: service was ok it was crowded so i understand.food was ok i really didn't enjoy my wings like i usually do. big fight broke out which just made it a weird situation.i will think twice about going back"
this is the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life! we came to celebrate a friend's birthday and staff made me and my group of friends wait an hour just to tell us that the fryer was not working even though they kept attending people that were walking in! the manager refused to speak with us! would not recommend this location to anyone! they didn't offer any sort of resolution! if i could give zero stars...would give negative stars!!!!
"we came here for lunch during the week. usually this place is pretty packed up if there are games playing but, fortunately we were in luck. this bww is located next to lazy dog outside the del amo mall. parking can be a little crazy but if you park in the structure you'll be fine.   as soon as you enter this foul moldy smell hits your face. it's quite unpleasant. the hosts were nice and friendly, we were sat pretty quickly. our server was very good, very attentive. she was one of the only servers on so her section was pretty big. but she was on top of everything. i would giver her service 5 stars. we ordered our food and within a couple minutes everything came out. the wings aren't terrible but pretty dry. some were over cooked. if it weren't for the sauces they were tossed in it would have been difficult to eat. i've been here before and the wings i ordered were perfectly cooked. so it's just inconsistent.   the decor inside is pretty cool. tv's litter the walls with sports memorabilia everywhere. i cansee why his place gets packed when important games are on. i usually prefer to sit outside during the day when it's nice. overall not a bad spot."
"probably one of the worst bdubs i've ever been to.  there was one bartender working sunday night football and had too much work for himself.he tried his best though.my problem is with the other wait staff. i asked two different people if i could get one sauce of blue cheese. they both said yes.  no one ever came. i saw them talking to other waiters hanging around.  meanwhile there are like 3 tables ready for other customers, only if they were cleaned.  i finally asked a manager, he was the third person i'd asked if i could get blue cheese. he finally brought it.everything feels so disorganized and uncared for. typically, bwws don't have great customer service, but this one was just a bit too much for me.definitely not coming back. peace"
"this place should shut down for a remodeling. the restrooms look like you just walked into a third world country with the sink faucets falling apart when you touch them. the men's urinalysis stalls seem to have been ripped out in a drunken rage. when my wife and i ordered our food, we were given one plastic fork to share. it seemed as though our waitress was more occupied with training someone. the place just looks like it's been abused for a decade with zero interest in repairing anything. the boneless wings tasted good. kinda hard to mess up fried food"
the bartenders were great. the food was cool. just another ordinary chain bar. built for the masses.
"why does it always smell like the sewer outside this restaraunt? i seriously want to know. my friends and i always go to bww for any celebration or birthdays. this place is like an upscale wingstop, only it is way more expensive with better french fries. i would always order snack size wings, basket fries and a beer and my bill alone would come out to $20+the wings are really good and i'll never get over their french fries. service is fast, depends on who you get. bdubs over wingstop any day."
"it's sad that we've come to expect slow and disappointing service every time we're here. we only come back because we enjoy the food.parmesan garlic and asian zing are our favorites. when we want to switch it up, we get honey bbq, thai ginger, or teriyaki. we prefer the potato wedges over their fries. i like the seasoning that's on them. their onion rings are good as well. i've always seen deep fried pickles on their menu and wanted to try them. maybe one day.i don't know why service here is always an issue. no matter which waiter or waitress we get, they do basically anything except tend to their tables (like gather in a corner and talk to one another, check their cell phones constantly, or completely disappear altogether). once we even waited about 15 minutes before someone came to our table to greet us. they're never around when we need water refills or napkins and food takes forever to arrive. empty tables from guests that have left stay piled with trash for long periods of time before anyone decides to clear them off. dine-in service has gotten so bad that we don't even eat at the restaurant anymore. we call our food in and take it home. yet, even that's not much better because the food is never ready when they say it will be.if not for their food, we would never return. but it's getting to the point where enough will be enough."
"im a huge bww fan as i used to go every week, the food doesn't taste any different in regards to location. however, i had the worst bww last night at this location. walked in, lady who looks like a supervisor perhaps does not acknowedge us (her and 3 other employees standing around leaning over counter. finally she says ""i only have hightops available at the bar, seat yourselves"" and turns back, no hello welcome etc. we are seated and wait 5+ min before server comes. this was at 10pm on a sunday night, they were not busy at all. we send in the order and about 25-30 min later the food comes all at once - including appetizers. the mozzerella sticks had dried out...the fries were cold and stale...the wings were hard. the food tasted like it was sitting for a while, even the sauce on the side that we had asked for had dried out under a lamp, there was a little film layer on it! the only photo i took was of the carrots that were forgotten and received​ last. our server was not necessarily the problem, her and the busser did not stop moving and working. the other 4 employees were still standing around in a circle chatting and on their phones. upon exiting, we pass who i assume is the manager -wearing a black bww shirt- he makes eye contact but does not say goodbye, thanks for coming, etc. i understand why the restaurant​ is run poorly after seeing the lack of customer service from management. do not recommend​ this location and ive been to them all from la to sd."
"why would this place be a 1 star you ask? can it be that bad? yes, it is that bad. the area outside smells like a sewer leak first off. probably not their fault. who knows. but i'm sure if they cared enough they would address it with the property managers.the wait is intentional. even though they have empty tables and booths. they intentionally do not fill them and force every one to wait at least 20 min before seating. this is to accommodate the waiter/ress. when we did sit our waiter was very nice. he deserved a 5 star hands down. but the wait and smell and overall dirty everything puts you in a bad place. we order simple things. medium traditional wings. snack traditional wings and small traditional wings. a poe boy. three kids meal with chicken tenders crispy. mozzarella sticks and fried pickles. 1 hour later. we get the food. we asked a few times what was taking so long. two groups that sat at the same time as us ate and paid and left before we got anything. not even the appetizers showed up. food did arrive hot and fresh. so idk what to say about the delay. the carpet is super dirty. and the seats and tables were sticky. asked for a rewipe of the table.the worst of all of this is the bathroom in the end. you go thinking you want to wash your hands and clean up. wrong. your better off with a hose out back. the sinks both are broken out of place entirely. just flopping around and busted. the mold and mildew all over the place. a very strong smell of urine so the ventilation is probably broken. tagging all over the place etched into the toilets. that's how bad it is. poop on the floor besides the toilet because the toilets are so bad that people would rather poop on the floor then touch the seats. yes the women's side was just as bad with also poop on the seats as well. we  all addressed this with the manager. he said they are working on it. hahaha. yeah maybe on a cold day in hell you will address it. corporate if you are reading this. either close this place down and renovate or be ready to deal with the health department soon. stay away my friends. far, far, far away."
our server was great but very else was bad. as soon as you walk into the restaurant it smells gross. the wait to get seated was 15 mins although the entire restaurant was empty. there was a pool of water by the soda machine and no one was cleaning it up. large hazard here that could of potentially been a lawsuit if someone slipped and fell! the carpet is gross and nasty.... there was crayons and food on the floor....the bathrooms were the worse. the toilets were yellow and dirty. there was toilet paper all over the floor. don't order the nachos. the meat on the nachos was cold!!! asked for the check and it took forever! one of the worse dinning experiences i've ever had :( this place used to be amazing!
the two guys serving us were incompetent. i get way better service in bay area.we were seated and no utensils at the table. asked the guy for utensils and there's 5 of us and he gives two sets of plastic wear not the silverware. too slow and didn't bring the carrots and celery that comes with the wings orders. no patient to ask. never coming back to this location again.
food was good but service is sooo slow when it comes to food. waited over 40 minutes and it was empty inside. drinks came out quickly and our server was helpful.
"torrance food crawl #242wings and sauces are the thing here. a great time to get wings here is on tuesday or thursday when they have some specials. on tuesday you can pay for 5 wings and get 5 more for free, or pay for 10 and get 10 free. on thursday boneless wings are 75 cents each. however, today i wasn't in the mood for wings and tried one of their burgers.the buffalo blue burger was labeled as their 'signature' burger. aside from the normal burger ingredients it came with a 'medium' sauce and blue cheese dressing and crumbles. the sauce was mild but good. there was an average amount of blue cheese on the burger. i believe that most people who want cheese on their burger are satisfied with one slice of the american stuff, but people who want blue cheese generally don't want the kitchen to skimp on the cheese portions and appreciate lots of blue cheese. the burger was fresh with a nice crunch from the vegetables. however, it was also a mess to eat with everything sliding off the bun. a fork and knife weren't provided so eating with my hands was my way of attacking the burger. fortunately, the server provided a lot of paper napkins, something probably appreciated much more by wing eaters but also useful for burger eaters.the french fries were a little on the thin side, not quite shoestring size, but good tasting. they didn't need any ketchup to cover-up the taste.the restaurant is a little dark indoors. there is a good sized patio outside that is a nice option if the weather is cooperating. on a relatively quiet tuesday afternoon it was relatively noisy, mainly from the design of the interior which has been designed to bounce sound around. service was a little slow when i first got there, i got the impression that servers were changing shifts or responsibilities when i was there, but everything eventually arrived."
"shady establishment, overcharged my credit card.  i won't be back--not worth it.  even worse?  the food.  and the booths.  and the restrooms. servers are friendly, but that's about it.  i should have listened to all the 1- and 2-star yelp reviews...big mistake!!"
why would you be okay with serving something that has obviously gone past the expiration date? that's a bad move. you've lost me as a customer.
i didn't have to wait one hour for my drinks or food!! :)this has got to be the 1st bww that i am satisfied with. i don't know if it was because we went on a tuesday but the service was perfect!! our waiter was very attentive... he came to check up on us every chance he got.. hell even the manager or supervisor herself was making rounds around the place making sure everyone was good. if that's not good service i dont know what is. my girls & i will definetly be back!!! i just hope the service they provide remains the same!! b.t.w shout's out to justin our waiter! you are one of a kind!!! keep up that amazing attitude you have!! super chill guy!!
"thank you abril for your awesome service this past monday night , it was a very pleasant experience! keep up the great work , she definitely should get a promotion"
"zero stars actually and a total fail... watching the warriors versus houston game and not 1 server came to our table for 45 mins.+ this is my first real-time review as i sit here hungry. a complete half of basketball has passed. it's halftime now and yet, no service at all... bar area self seating. party of four still nothing...no one to take our order or even ask us for our refreshment order. we asked several waiters to help us and they all pointed to someone else as a responsibility to take care of us... may 20, 2018, 6:06pm, we left, walked and are never coming back to this porous location for b-dubs! so don't come to this location if you're hungry cause no one here wants to help you... gm must not know what he/she is doing because it's obvious that the oversight is lacking. no hustle looks to me like everyone is hiding in the back."
"i dont know how many times i been in here i never experienced something bad about this location but today was a little different and after today every time that i go back i will ask for karen waitress she is the best very efficient always asking if we were ok or needed something i asked her about a game that i wanted to watch and immediately took care of that, like i said ask for karen she is the best!!!!"
"this was our first time at bww, and we were pretty disappointed.  the service was okay, we had a new server, so there were a few mix ups, but he was pleasant and did his best to make sure our order was correct.  the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the food however left a lot to be desired.  the first thing we noticed on our way to our table was that the floor was so dirty that our feet were sticking to it with each step.  once we were seated, the game box at the table was so filthy with food and fingerprints that there was no way i would have touched it.  it was truly disgusting to look at while eating.  as for the food, i ordered the buffalo chicken ranch sandwich.  the bun, vegetables, and sauce were good, but the breaded chicken had a weird, chewy consistency to it.  :(  i'm sure we won't go back."
i would give this place a zero if i could. it was a was a wednesday night not very busy. it took an hour to receive our order. within that hour our waitress wendy never paid a visit to advise us that our order was coming up.  never offered a refill on drinks. terrible service. i we t to take my 3yo to the bathroom and i held her over the toilet. it was so disgusting and dirty.  the restaurant itself was pretty dirty. we will never go back... that is for sure.
"so i received a buffalo wild wings gift card for christmas two years ago and decided to finally put it to use. over all the venue is cool. it's the perfect place to catch whatever spot is on. it's open, has plenty of comfortable seating, a large bar, and lots of massive tvs. they even have a happy hour! $2 off draft beers & $5 appetizers. the service is okay, our waitress could not have been nicer, but she didn't do a great job checking in with us. after she took our order, it was hard to get her attention for refills and the check. the menu is surprisingly large, but the food is just okay. i stuck with ordering wings, and since i don't love anything spicy, i ordered wings with sauces in the green category. i should have gotten the sauce on the side, even the greens were too spicy for me, and i only ended up eating 3 or 4 wings total. additionally, i thought everything was pretty expensive. i'm not sure i'll be back."
"i was in this past saturday for the first time in years with a small group for a birthday dinner. despite being a party of seven we were greeted and seated rather quickly. unfortunately that was the last instance that this location would excel. service...our server seemed overwhelmed by his section or he was really forgetful. he took our first drink and food orders really quickly but unfortunately it didn't all come out correct. certain condiments and sides were forgotten yet we were charged for them. he never came back to see if all was well, we had to get up and ask another server for silverware and more drinks.food..the food was average. the general consensus was that it was ""ok"", nothing really stood out. we ordered apps, a couple entrees and a lot of boneless wings and the best i could say was meh. we all left some food behind. overall just a really average experience. i'd hesitate to return."
"we've been here a few times but this time was so disappointing.  i believe our servers name was brian. we ordered our drinks and told him we needed more time to decide what we wanted to eat. he must have waited till we finally ordered our food to put our drink order in because they were not busy but took way too long for our drinks to get to us. and it wasn't even our server that delivered them to our table. once i ordered our sampler, i asked for boneless wing yet he brought out regular wings. not sure if he was new but definitely needs some more training."
"for being such a popular chain restaurant, this was my first time at bww! came here on saturday night with my mom, dad, and boyfriend for a last minute bite to eat. my mom had also never been here before but we knew that getting wings was a must! even though we didn't have a reservation and it was 6:15 pm on a saturday night, we were able to be seated right away. our waitress samantha was very sweet and patient the whole night. she didn't rush us as we tried to make decisions on the different dry rubs and sauces for the wings we wanted. for a starter, we had the sampler which included wings (your choice of grilled or crispy), fried pickles (so good!), chili cheese fries, and spinach and artichoke dip. there was more than enough food in the sampler for the four of us although if you had been with a group of 6 or more, i would opt for two appetizers. for an entree, i had the buffalo chicken salad and it was spicy! to cool off the hotness, i had ranch dressing. overall, i would definitely recommend this bww location! it's a great place to catch sports games, meet up with friends, and even just get some apps. i took away a star because our food took a little longer than usual to come out and the restaurant wasn't packed."
"service was very good and the place was spacious and laid out better than the one in sicklerville but they both had the bad food in common. my ""fast break"" lunch was indeed out in less than 15 minutes but the tiny honey bbq chicken salad was lukewarm and tough and for the price of $9 i could get a chicken salad 3x the size at chick fi la. the side of chili had big chunks and was actually good. my gf's boneless wings were half cold and the side caesar salad was a chore for her after only one bite.all she could taste was water since it didn't seem like it was rinsed at any point before being served.   even if free we won't be frequenting any bww again."
"stopped here for lunch on a thursday and ordered a beer and boneless wing special. locally available ipa, nothing special, was a very pricy $8.25 for a pint! it's not that expensive in downtown philly. and we were wondering why the place was empty! a few months ago it was packed for lunch when beer prices were reasonable. we won't be back, instead will eat at reasonably priced beer down the street at pj whelihans (and tastier wings).hard to believe that this chain is owned by roark capital group, the same people who operate miller's ale house, another great place with reasonably priced beer and food."
"this is the first bww i've been to in years where the food was piping hot. also, i've had a craving for hot wings and decent ones are almost impossible to find in philly. this location is actually really nice, and well kept...and about a 10 min drive from cherry hill mall which is convenient as well. my tastebuds were satisfied. it's the only thing here that reminds me of home so i'll go back again."
"me and my husband always use online ordering since we both work late. when we have the usual guy (kaleb) who is there when we go along with 2 other girls (not sure of their names) we have absolutely no problems. anytime someone else is there it's the worst experience. from not getting the correct order/ missing part of our order to paying almost a dollar per dressing cup and it not even being a quarter of the way full it's pretty annoying. if it weren't for kaleb and the other two girls if it were our first time there and we got the other ""fill ins"" we would've avoid this location all together and we'd drive a little farther and go to the sicklerville location. when you're paying for something you expect it to be there and when i'm paying 60 cents per cup of dressing when i can go buy a full bottle for $2 they need to be more cautious of what they're serving."
they get 5 just for customer service! dude that was working the the take out counter was super nice and helpful! the wings were actually delicious when i ate them at home! full of flavor and very thick! i'm certainly coming back for football season! i only wish they offered breaded wings as well!
"hosted our league fantasy football draft one year at this location. there was a minimum food/drink amount for the party which wasn't an issue. we were just ramping up slowly, however, the waitress was rude in conveying this information to us as if we were some group of cheap skates. we'll take our business elsewhere."
"i used to be a fan bww...but i am no longer a fan. this was my second trip to a different location bww hoping for redemption. sadly the food will not be redeemed by service here was actually really good for the time we went around 1:30-2:00. i ordered the 15 minute lunch special the boneless wings and a side ceased salad. wings tasted fine they were at least hot unlike previous visits to other locations. the salad though....was not good. how does one mess up a salad? it's lettuce for goodness sake. it was just way to watery, it's almost like i got water as my salad dressing lol. our server was very nice and attentive never had to wait for a refill. however later that night my boyfriend and i both got sick...for the second time after eating at a bww coincidence? probably not."
"how does this place even stay open? the wings are horrible. they're  chewy and all the sauces are super salty. on a good note, the chicken soft tacos were good.the service was fair, he kept coming to the table over and over again while you're trying to eat.  bottom line, do not waste your money on this place. head over to the mall and eat at the yard house, firebirds or distrito's"
i came here for their veteran's day special in the evening. i sat at the bar and ordered wings with fries and a beer. the bartender was friendly and timely with checking in to see how everything was. the food came out timely and tasted good. the people around me at the bar were friendly as well. we enjoyed light conversation here and there. i'm not sure why so many have had such a poor experience.  i have no complaints on my experience. there are a ton of tvs here to watch games. i mean a ton. if there is a sports game on and you can't view it here i don't think it's televised. that's how many tvs they have.
"so i was in the mood for wings and opted to stop in here for lunch.  i had the chipotle bbq and mango habanero.  both were very tasty.   afterwards i had the ice cream overload - kind of thought there would have been more chocolate/caramel sauce. overall the restaurant and restrooms were very clean.  the only issue i had was inattention by the wait staff.  i will say when i walked there was no one at the front desk, and i was one of 2 or 3 people in the place.  the wait i had came by so infrequently that i was there 1.5 hours just for lunch. once food was ordered it came out quickly, but the wait between sodas and the time i finished my wings and ordering dessert seemed a bit extreme."
i have never been to any of the other bwws and it was a solid experience.  nothing out of the ordinary to write home about but wasn't terrible either.  good place for a drink if you live close by but i would not travel far.  portion size is good.  everyone left content.
they discontinued the half price traditional wings on tuesdays. i still come here occasionally but not once a week like before. wings are still pretty good.
we ordered takeout from here and it was terrible! the wings were cold and the food seemed like it had been sitting for hours! when we got to the takeout desk the to-go host let us know that the food just came out. hmm i don't think so! the best thing was the fried pickles and that's why i am giving 2 stars. please do better. i don't think i will be dining here in the future.
"came in with my sisters and dad. we sat down table was a mess. so far hating it. we sat right down though. table was messy and dirty. we had ask for it to be wiped down. this place needs some improvement. so i just got done. i got a plain cheese quesadilla. it was ok but not the best i ever had... my dad got the wild wings. they were ok but not as great as the c-view.  my sister was ok with the burger but you know, she's 5 so who knows what she thinks. anyways it seems like my sister hates the pizza. the only thing that was good at this place is the sodas,beer, and our waitress. ( my dad got the beer) this place really deserves 2 stars. the stars go to the waitress."
"really enjoyed this place. lots of tvs so you'll definitely be able to watch your game no matter where you sit, also really like the spacious booths for seating. if anyone in your group is tall or big, you won't have to worry about being cramped in. we came on a saturday early afternoon, not super busy. our service was just fine. we were pleasantly surprised! enjoyed the sampler appetizer - onion rings had a favor nice gentle flavor, nachos are surprisingly good and mozzarella sticks are just right. i had a grilled chicken wrap which was exactly as expected, no frills, a nice lunch. finally, our waitress was informative but not annoyingly pushy about anything. would definitely come back."
my favorite place to get cheap wings. sorry bonchon. they're cheap on tuesdays for their traditional and and thursdays for their boneless. come thru during happy hour for good drinks as well. don't forget to order the nacho dessert which is so heavenly. ugh. now i'm craving it again.
"i've been here a couple times and i have to say the waitstaff is nice. however, the wings here are just ok. i've tried almost all the flavors and dry rubs, but they just seem to be bland overall. the wings come in 4 sizes i believe, the large being around 20 wings. it works out to be more than $1 per wing. in my opinion, that price is only justified if the wings are amazing, however the food here is far less exceptional. its a decent place to get drinks/apps if you are watching the game and they are offering game time specials, otherwise they are a bit overpriced for they bland and/or super salty food..."
the worst take out restaurant ever! first of all it looks like they legit threw the fries from someone else's plate and just put them inside my container my burger was all over the place i had like three mushrooms on it the onion wasn't even on the burger it was under it !!!! horrible ! i had better service from wendy's or mcdonald's then here . i will never pick up food from here again . i understand the food on the website looks perfected by a filter but sheesh what is this !
"came here for lunch. i saw the house appetizer as i was walking to our table, and it looked sooo good, so i ordered that with the honey wings. my husband got the 4 piece wings spicy with a house salad.  we had to return the house salad because the lettuce was not fresh(some of the veggie was turning brown and wrinkle), the waiter was very friendly about us returning the salad, and replaced it with french fries. the appetizer came with mozzarella sticks, loaded nachos, onion rings and wings. the wings were good. the loaded nacho was a little sweeter than i would prefer, the onion rings could be a little more deep fried, and i asked for marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks which took forever to come(there was only a few tables at the time). i will probably return just because it's so close to walmart and lowes when i am craving for some fried food."
i enjoy my wings and sports. i've haven't had a issue there yet and i've been going the past 3 years 8x a year easy. if sunday is a bust then go here drop $10 on wings and rock out the whole 1pm football games or the 4pm games
"stopped in for lunch. place was slow but clean and well lit. sat at the bar and was served by a gent named william. he was prompt. placed my order. garlic parm wings and fries lunch special. food came out in a timely manner. wings were delicious!! nice, big sized wings might i add. the garlic parm sauce was immaculate. i recommend this place."
this place has great service. it just always smells like a wet mop for some reason. the quality of the projectors are pretty low compared to the tvs. the food and drinks are a bit over priced for the area .
"i went to buffalo wild wings for the first time after wanting to go out, but also needing to keep my food low carb. we chose this place because they had wings and so many sauces, which would make us feel like we had ample options. we got the large traditional wings (18 wings) and chose 4 sauces (mango habanero, blazin, garlic parmesan and thai). all of the flavors were true to their description. the only warning is that they really aren't playing with those blazin wings. i've had ghost pepper sauces and spiced wings in the past. typically, they are toned down and mildly spicy. these things were hot!!! i think that my max was about 2, but i'd still order them again since i like spicy food. i'd also recommend requesting that these be extra crispy. we made the mistake of not requesting this at another location and the wings turned out a bit baked tasting (so we sent them back). overall, though, the food at this location came out quick and the service was really prompt. i'm not sure how their other food tastes but their wings are amazing!"
"overall, i like buffalo wild wings. i think some items are slightly overpriced for what you're getting, but other items are pretty fairly priced. i've never had a bad waitress or a negative experience. last time i was there though, the hostess was no where to be found. it wasn't a busy day, and it took about 10 minutes before she headed back. our waitress was great and so was the food we ordered."
"this has got to be one of the worse restaurants in philadelphia. my experience there was terrible. this restaurant years ago had refills on flavored lemonades (now that's a thing of the past) not to mention the ice machine was broken (luke warm soda doesn't taste very good) . the service was terrible after not having compensation for a warm soda. the best part of boneless wings was the sauce, the chicken is tasteless and dry with the aftertaste of grease. wouldn't recommend this particular place for anyone looking for good food and service"
didn't even get to eat here because the staff rather just look at us instead of seating us. stood at the front for about 5 minutes to only see staff members walking by and looking at us. decided to just get up and leave seeing that they only had probably one or two tables seated at the moment anyway
great place to watch the game. had no wait on a friday night around 8pm. service a little slow at times but not horrible. waitress let us enjoy the sixers game without bothering us too much. wings and fries always good.  great choice of many sauces on the scoville heat scale. not a gourmet restaurant so don't expect anything too fancy.
this place doesn't earn deserve a star. horrible service the waitress do not care for their job at all. my friends & i came to watch the game and we asked to change the closest screen to us and she said its already requested by someone else... okay fine but let me know why the 4 hours we were there the screen didnt change from the bdubs advertisement? our food was cold and disgusting and ontop of that we got our bill split and when we got our credit card back she added $10 more (still do not know why) & thats before writing/putting a tip. this place needs help asap.
great food and service. i don't think i've ever not enjoyed a meal here. staff is always friendly. every sporting event that is being played it televised so everyone can enjoy their favorite game.
"street tacos please  with salt & vinegar fries ! asian zing wings , yes ! i am too excited about happy hour and the times (even though a waitress told me it started at 10 ) signs say 9pm !"
"waited an hour to be seated in an empty dining area. waitress took forever to bring drinks, food, and anything we asked for. only giving the three stars because the wings are always good."
"every time i've gone to this location, the service has been prompt and all the servers have been friendly. food is consistently good, even when we get take out!"
i love love love wings. the service was excellent. we arrived there very early so there was no crowd. the wings are amazing. they are all evenly cooked and they are a nice size. very clean. not too noisy.
"so i went to buffalo wild wings in downingtown, pa. me and my sister and the biggest turn off for me was our waitress dropping a whole mess of to go containers on the floor than she placed them back in their original place. you don't know what kind of germs are on the floor and that was so super gross..we actually watched her put them back up. other than that she forgot to bring my sisters water back when asked than she didn't even offer us a bag when we got our food to go. it was like she was done with us before we even got up to leave. needless to say our to go food got thrown in the trash. the food was good though. but i'm not sure i want to visit at this location again."
great experience this time around. our bartender ashley was very attentive and very pleasant. i recommend this bww at the rosevelt boulevard. worth every penny for a good experience on a football night. keep up the great work.
plenty of beers on tap and the food is always good. wide variety of wing flavor options and plenty of parking
