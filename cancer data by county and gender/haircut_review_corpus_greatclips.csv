"i walked in with a lot of ""hair baggage"" - heavy processing, regrowth, etc. i needed to get damaged hair cut off while retaining as much length as possible. stacey nailed it. she was easy to talk to and understood what i needed pretty quickly."
"if zero stars were an option. checked in on line, when we arrived i explained that my daughter needed a shampoo/blow dry. the girl that came up to the counter began to act strangely and rudely said she could do a shampoo and 'i can do a finger dry"".apparently they didn't have time to dry hair with a brush because they are having a hair cut sale and ""customers for haircuts might come in""i have never heard of a business that didn't want to take your money for services.my daughter spent almost 2 months in a burn hospital and is unable to wash and blow dry her own hair. this was the most ridiculous display of customer service, i have ever experienced. wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.maybe they should display a huge sign on their door and on line...stating....""we are only able to do $7.99 haircuts right now even if no one else is in here...because they might come in at any moment!"
"this review should be negative stars! do not get your hair cut by the older hispanic lady with the glasses, she will butcher your hair!!! she messed up my kid so bad he had to buy a hat just to cover what she did to him  it was such an easy cut..smdh! this lady cut half of his head bald, honestly she should not be cutting hair! she should be fired!"
"crummy service.  seems like every time i come here they shorten the time they spend with you.  hurried cut, leaving hair all over your clothes, face, forehead.  don't even think about going back to work or anywhere after this cut except straight to a shower.  pathetic.and now let's talk about the actual haircut.  crappy to say the least.  shoddy job, crummy uneven cut by all stylists, not even a fraction of what a true barbershop could accomplish.  simply put don't go here unless you want pure garbage."
bad experience. i went there because i had a coupon but apparently they don't take electronic coupons. we live in an electronic world. would never go back
some new girl just gave me a crew cut. said my customer info said that was my cut. week before big business. trip.  i am not a vain person but this is ridiculous. never going here again.  told girl i get it cut every month of 6 weeks.  can't she tell i don't get a crew cut.  ignorant and inexperienced.
"crappy place, does not take expired coupons. doesn't state on window about there coupon policy. will not go there again"
"if i had known that i was going to get my hair chop-chopped  by edward scissorhands then i wouldn't have even entrusted my precious hair to them.  i realize, of course, that by going to great clips i wasn't going to be getting a grade-a  haircut but then again i wasn't going to great clips for anything but a trim.  a very minimal trim that should have been anything but difficult...instead i got a hair trim where way too much length was taken off and the cut itself looked too, top choppy.  my hair now looks as if i had taken a pair of kitchen scissors to my hair and just started cutting away.  when i went in i specifically asked for a teeny tiny trim so that my dead ends could be done away with and i also specified that i did not want any thinning or layering of my hair.  what did i get?  an inch and a half cut off of my hair and the most choppy layers imaginable.  the cost of the haircut was $14 and for females (who, sorry guys, need much more effort and acute attention put into our hair) you get what you pay for.  if i'd known they'd be so incompetent at simply trimming the ends i'd never have step foot in here. i'd never have come for an actual haircut and i guarantee that i never will.  however, for males, great clips is a good option and in fact my fiancé comes here and gets his hair cut regularly and it always turns out well."
"been coming here for years and love this place. so much so that even after i moved to the city i still find myself coming back to them. go see ross, wait for him if he's busy with another customer. he is absolutely worth the wait. i promise you that you will not be disappointed."
"stopped in today for a haircut. i have been to great clips before so they have a write up on how i like my hair cut. things seemed to be going smoothly when the lady cut off a large chunk of my hair. it was late and dark, so i paid for my haircut, tipped her and left. i get home to better light...the lines around my ears look like an impressionist painting. it is basically a buzz cut because she left so little of my hair long on the top of my head. i will never return to this location. waist of time and money. guess i have to wait for my hair to grow back."
went for a quick haircut during lunch and got a great one from ross.  he was attentive to exactly the haircut i wanted.  made sure the top was the length i wanted before he actually cut.  i would definitely come back here for another cut from him.  in and out in less than 30 minutes too!
"horrible service. checked in online, arrived on time, and was asked at the counter if i checked in online to which i confirmed. then sat there and was repeatedly skipped for 20 minutes beyond my time until had to ask why i was being skipped for people walking in without appointments and i was blamed for not checking in at the desk when the lady obviously failed to mark it after asking me initially. what is the point of an online app if you ignore those that use it? and where is the customer service to ask why 1 guy has been sitting there for 30 minutes while the person walking in now gets helped."
"great place for an inexpensive but decent hair cut. bill (owner) is very friendly, and makes sure his service standards are kept high whether he is there or not. a great plus when the place is open long hours for your convenience. most stylists do decent with my frizzy, thinning hair. as with most things, some do better than others.a great option is to sign up online to save your place and cut wait times! you can't pick a stylist, but can save 15 minutes by getting in line before you leave the house!also check for coupons. great deals in the mail! tip well if you like the service, too."
"went in to have about 2 inches cut off the bottom of my straight long hair. i asked her for a perfectly straight even bottom line cut. also stated that i absolutely did not want the front to be any shorter then the back & that i did not want a curved look. started with a shampoo which was optional by the way, and a conditioning treatment to detangle. the shampoo job was ok but i didn't think she rinsed much of the conditioner out. the stylist didn't organize the hair very well as she was cutting it, and literally she finished in slightly over 5 minutes. when she was finished she showed me the results whilemy hair was still wet. well , you can't tell anything when the hair is still wet. i guess at that point i was done and expected to leave. so i asked if she was able to blow dry it and style it which is pretty easy with straight hair that's all one length. she used the blow dryer and tossed my hair around with her fingers a little bit and then asked if that was ok. now it was worse and even harder to tell if she cut it straight. my head was still very wet so i asked her to finish drying it. i think she was bothered by this because now a couple people had come in the front door and were waiting. she never used a brush to assist in the drying process. when she said she was done the 2nd time, i still had wet sections throughout my hair and it wasn't even brushed or combed to lay flat so there was no way to tell if this was a good haircut. once i got home i rewashed my hair because it felt like there was still a sticky layer of conditioner left in it from the stylist, and i wanted to check and see if my hair was cut straight. after i dried and styled and smoothed my hair as i usually do i saw that the haircut was a disappointment and a fail ... it is not a continuous straight line, the front is shorter then the back and there are areas that are jagged throughout. so, skip this location if you're looking for a nice simple straight line . mine turned out crooked and the overall experience was not great . the conversation she initiated was a downer too. all she talked about was cancer... i should probably go back and ask someone else if they'd be willing to correct my cut, but i'm reluctant thinking the place is really centered on the ""quick get em in and get em out"" business mode, not quality. i'm not sure why i even gave it a 2 star rating . it did however appear to be clean."
friendly and clean in and out 30 min no appointment just walked in. they did a great job. i've used them every time i'm at the all state arena doing a show. i've used great clips all over the u.s. never been dissatisfied or disappointed!!
"so i just witnessed one of the most rude customers in my life at this great clips. i was patiently waiting for my haircut when this lady starts yelling at the one of the employees about how she's getting screwed in her prepaid haircuts. i don't know the background and whole story why she was so upset. it doesn't matter. there's absolutely no reason to yell across the store when the person you're speaking with is two feet away, especially when your children are with you. what a wonderful example to set for you kids. throughout it all, the employee was professional, helpful and kept her calm. at one point she did end up tearing up, excused herself and walked to the back room to compose herself. the customer then complained and yelled about how she just left her and didn't resolve her problem. ridiculous and embarrassing. she should be ashamed of herself, but she won't. she never will. she's ignorant to the world and will always think she's right no matter what and will teach those lessons to her kids. let's continue the cycle. as for the employee? thank you so much. you are an amazing person to be able to put up with people like that. i couldn't have done it."
"i respectfully disagree with a previous comment, this place was over priced and not a good haircut.   i actually went to another barber shop after leaving this place.   this was easier than to keep on trying to explain what was wrong."
"been here twice. i had different styists each time but i don't mind not having the same stylist every time i get a hair cut.  service is always super friendly and courteous. the owner/manager (guy who greets customers) is always friendly & accomodating. super clean place. hair on the floor are swept/cleaned right away. called ahead to set up appointment but owner said no appointment necessary for a hair cut. service is straight-forward, quick, no muss/no fuss, and affordable (i believe approx. $15 per hair cut).  keep up the great work!"
"ross cut off my long hair into a short style on my lunch! when i got back to the office everyone complimented me on the beautiful cut. 5 stars for ross talented, professional, personable ."
"if i could put no stars in i would. i went in here today with my mom. both of us have been in before and had good and bad experiences. after today though, my entire family will never return. i was there a month ago and the man who cut my hair did not really do what i asked. when i got home, i wasn't too happy but i decided to wait and see if it would grow on me. it didn't. and everyone i talked to about it said my hair looked uneven and everything i did didn't help. i went in today and started to explain how unhappy i was and the stylist began arguing with me about it. she told me i was wrong and that it wasn't uneven. i told her i had even consulted with another stylist before going in today and that the stylist said it was uneven and needed to be fixed. she continued to say i was wrong and i decided to get up and leave without a haircut. i'm not a big believer in ""the customer is always right"" but i do know that i am the one who has to style my hair everyday for work and no matter what i do it looked horrible. my teenage students could even tell that it was a bad cut. my mom received a haircut that was way shorter than she asked for and it was uneven as well. we will not ever return to this salon. we are currently at another place altogether and getting our hair fixed; we will go here from now on."
they cut extensions!! hair cuts for purchased hair (lol) is getting increasingly difficult to find. stephanie cut my hair and did an amazing job. very happy.
my hair is pretty simple to do. and mike took all of 5 minutes to do it. the top seems ok but the back is asymmetrical and with a weird invected half circle instead of a straight line. maybe at 9am they are still a little groggy.. dunno. i expected a little more attention to detail. disappointing.
"mike is my absolute favorite stylist in chicago. i've gone to other places to get my hair cut and even sat in other stylists' chairs at this great clips location, but nobody listens and cuts like mike.i'm growing out my hair right now so i'm a relatively ""easy"" trim, but it makes such a difference when i can walk out the door still feeling like my hair is long. mike is also great at evening up my bangs and layers each time so i don't look too scraggly.i've loved coming here for the past three years and will continue to stop in no matter what neighborhood i move to!"
i came here right when they opened at 9 am to get about 4 inches cut off my obnoxiously long hair. they offer a special where you can get your haircut for 10 bucks between 9 am and noon on weekdays. stephanie was my stylist and she was amazing! very kind and gentle with my hair. the salon was clean and the service was amazing.
"i always come here to get my hair cut or trimmed because of it's convenience and also because it offers a great student discount. i've never been one to pay $20+ for a trim so great clips is the perfect option. i never check-in online (their version of an appointment) but there never is much of a wait which is nice. the hair cut itself, since it is a trim usually lasts pretty short so it's quick and easy! however, last time i was here the hair stylist was so rough with my head by the end i was sure he had pulled out more hairs than cut. i understand my hair may have been tangled but he was really going at it with the comb to get the knots out and i feel like it could have been done a lot gentler. in general he was rough during the cut as well and while the final look ended up fine it wasn't the most enjoyable hair cut i've had.the venue is nice and clean but this experience really caught me off guard and i will have to check who is working next time before i walk in so as not to experience the same thing."
"walked in this morning and was seated immediately! just wanted to leave a review thanking stephanie, you did a great job with my fade and it was really nice chatting with you about school and chicago!hope to be back soon if i'm in the area. good luck with your upcoming internship too! thank you stephanie!"
"mike, the manager here, is the only person that i go to for a haircut.  there are 20 other places to get a haircut that's closer to me, but mike is the absolute best so i go here.  the overall vibe here is very lively and very friendly"
"we recently moved to california but i needed to leave a review for the wonderful, fabulous mike at great clips. he cut my family's hair for the 3+ years we lived off clark street in lincoln park. he is a wonderful person and a very talented stylist! we miss you mike!"
"they dont know how to cut hair, i literally asked for a trim. how hard can that be? its uneven its a wreck. they are not professionals."
"i have been to this salon before and generally get a decent cut, but tonight i am unhappy because i explained that i was growing out my hair on top and i just wanted the sides and back cut with as little as possible cut from the top. it looked fine when i left the salon because my hair was still wet. when i arrived home and it was dry, it was much shorter than i wanted. i am very disappointed since i have been growing out my hair for months. i think i will start looking for a new place to get my hair cut where they actually listen to you."
"stephanie is easily the best hair stylist i ever had the pleasure to go to.she likes her work, does it to perfection and has an awesome sense of humor too.i, personally, have a kinda weird style statement and i mostly don't listen to stylists, etc. but stephanie definitely understands what i look for and gives me perfect suggestions, which i listen."
"this great clips is alright. the staff is friendly but the few times that i've visited, they made mistakes. the first girl that cut my hair was excellent, so i came back. the next one gave me a slightly uneven hair cut but it wasn't anything i couldn't touch up myself. the most recent experience was embarrassing because the stylist said my previous haircut didn't look great, which i agreed with but after she gave me a trim and tried to fix the uneven sections, she said she still didn't like it but there was nothing else she could do. i let her know that i didn't mind losing length as long as the mistakes were corrected. my hair at the time was mostly all one length so i thought it would be a fairly simple correction.i decided to pay more at another salon to receive more consistent cuts. i hope to return in the future because it's so close to home and reasonable in price but unfortunately it's not an option at this point in time."
"this shop just relocated but i went to their previous location on diversey several times and i've always come out with a good haircut at a great price. this may not be the place if you have some complicated haircut that you're anal about but for a basic haircut they get the job done.  they usually have three or more people working so there usually isn't much of a wait.  if you can get in weekdays between 9:00 a.m. and noon, a haircut is only $9.99. otherwise, it's $14."
alex is a real star:) she is amazing! i went and had an up-due for a very important event with her and for a fraction of the salon price she absolutely knocked my socks off with her creation. please ask for alex and you will have blow out of a lifetime... love love love my experience!
"i love this salon! i have a boyish pixie cut that i am very particular about, and a fear of haircuts has had me cutting it myself for years. this is the only place i've been to with stylists who seem to really listen to what i want and give such satisfactory results! i've been seeing stephanie here for months (by coincidence! she always ends up the one cutting my hair) and she's incredibly sweet and funny, and so easy to talk to! she always does a great job -- i know i'm going to have a great day every time i see her! she's really respectful of me trimming my bangs and sides in between haircuts, too, which i appreciate! she cuts off the extra bulk, but leaves my style exactly the way it is. i am so grateful for this great clips!"
"definitely a great deal. i was paying double + tip for a great haircut nearby so decided to try and cutback on expenses and check out great clips. the shop is clean, the price is great (i had a coupon but weekdays 9-12 are $9.99 and usual price is $14) and my barber joey helped alleviate some of the usual awkwardness of a haircut by adding some decent conversation!"
"great haircut, great service, and what a clean shop.  mike gave me one of the best haircuts i've had in a long time!"
"great new place- they just moved from their old location on clark/diversey.  this new place is very clean, nice, and the service was great.  i was in and out in under 15 minutes with a great haircut."
"checked in online way before noon, braved the - 25 windchills to get there, ended up arriving due to traffic and weather at 12:02, and they wouldn't honor the early bird special that ended at 12. the former store on diversey would have honored it as long as i was checked in, and in fact did so in the past. not the way to treat a regular customer, so they lost this one."
"i went in for a simple 1inch trim of my hair and ended up loosing about 4inches. i had long hair with a slight angle, i don't think the girl knew what that meant because before i knew it i was missing half of my hair in the front. it was a waste of money and now i'll have to wait months for my hair to grow back out."
never too busy when i come in. they always have great staff and a cheery demeanor. the cuts i get are always what i want and they have no problem fixing up anything i want touched up. consistently great men's cuts!edit: after waiting 20 minutes a couple who had called in were bumped in front of me. i was not told they might have someone in front of me and they didn't let me know what was going on when they took them instead of me until i asked.
"i wish i can give this salon a zero stars but i can't. walked into the great clips on elston in chicago; i asked for a haircut. first of all they stylist both were so rude. one literally screamed across the salon to get the attention of the other person who would eventually cut my hair. so few things about this stylist who serviced me, 1. she had dirty clothes on and just messy ( the insoles on her shoes were out and flapping as she walked )2. she took literally 5 mins to cut my hair. i asked her for a bob i even showed her pictures. she split my hair in 3 and cut all the same length. i've gotten plenty of bob haircuts and no one has taken that approach would not be back to any great clips. even that 15 $ i paid was too much."
"the owner of this location is garbage, and so is the staff. hence why it shut down quickly after new ownership. it's sad how they tarnish the name of a big company simply because the owner of this specific location puts zero quality into it's establishment. zero customer service whatsoever and terrible haircuts all around."
i receive by far the worst hair cut i've every had and will never go back to a great clips ever again. this women should not be allow to cut anyone else's hair. beware!!!
wow these people are terrible. they closed to early when online it says 6pm. and when you call them they literally hang up on you. i understand it's sunday you want to go home and rest but do your job right. especially if it says open until 6pm it's 4:28. stop hanging up on your customers.
5:34 on sunday store closes at 6:00 but the guy won't cut my sons hair . doors are locked and he is cleaning . thanks great clips i
"this place is busy,but i understand why.. lydia is very nice. she was able to cut my daughter's hair with no issues. very friendly staff. if you want to get in on time, use their app. you can schedule your cut. nice touch..."
"sometimes this place gets really busy and the wait can be 45 minutes.  but the workers are friendly, and the interior is clean.  they do give out these coupons for savings off of cuts and since it is next to me i been going here.  shares the lot where i work so it has huge parking, and if you do have to wait, there is a subway and a starbucks walking distance."
being a huge fan of great clips i went by and picked up a haircut. this seems to be a new location. the lady who cut my hair did a great job and i have no complaints. the store was clean and service was fine. i'll probably go back here again since it's kind of close to where i live. nothing else really to report. just another great clips.../shrug
lydia the manager was very friendly & helpful after i had a bad incident there. since then i only go there to get my haircut now & i always make sure she is the one to do it. i am quite satisfied.
"went here for a haircut two weeks ago, it was my second time. i say, wasn't too crowded. was called and said that i wanted a shampoo and wash. so, i have very thick and wavy hair. i had rose who was nice.  went out to dinner with my friend tonight and she informed me that my hair is completely lopsided and uneven.  i was mortified.  she took a pic for me to see and since i wasn't offered a blow dry with the haircut i guess that's why it wasn't noticed. i wish i never wasted my time or money here, and i wish i went to gallery of hair instead.  more money,  but at least i would have been happy the first time.  now i have to go get it redone and even shorter than what i wanted.  on my job interview tomorrow i have to wear my hair down, but not with this embarrassing haircut, that looks like i did it myself."
"friendly staff, clean atmosphere, quick service and extra coupons to save you a few bucks!!! i get my hair cut here regularly and i use the handy app to check in... in and out in approximately 20 minutes with a great haircut!"
"i never actually got my haircut here...i was in the shopping center and thought i would get a haircut. when i walked in a women from behind the counter barked out ""phone number?""  i was the only person there so i knew she was talking to me. why does an off-price/chain hair cut place that doesn't take appointments need my phone number? what happened to the canned chain store greeting? ""welcome to our mega company""i quickly realized why i was the only person there and left."
"i love this place. you can get a great, top notch haircut for under $20 including tip! eyebrows trimmed/cleaned up for free....as a guy i am not good with my eyebrows! parking is also very easy as it's located in a strip mall type setting with lots of available spaces ... the stylists (espcially lydia) are very knowledgeable and friendly.... all of the information about your haircut is saved in the computer for next time...for example the number buzzer you need, length on top etc...i also was told you can check into the waiting list online to save time.....(though i've never waited that long ). and they also have an early bird special and free haircut after ten cuts...... really happy with this place and location!!"
"well .. walked in about an hour after they opened. one stylist working .. one client in the chair .. on in the waiting area. she checked me in, and told me to ""run an errand for 20 minutes."" .. no worries , i was a walk-in, and it was only 20 min. ran my errand , came back .. apparently, when i was told to ""run and errand"" .. 4 clients before me were also told to ""run an errand"".. waiting area was full, still one stylist, and i was 4th in order .. translation , and hour and a half / 2 hour wait for a basic cut. if the stylists would have been more honest upfront , or a bit more welcoming , perhaps i would have stayed or tried it again.. i know it's a cheap, assembly line haircut. you get what you pay for ..thankfully due to the one stylist and several clients , i didn't even get the chance to pay for anything."
"very good customer service, usually in and out pretty quick. i've seen them be very understanding in tough situations and i've never had an issue."
"very friendly service, open minded staff who is open to anything i want adjusted in a haircut. always clean when i come. or stylists are cleaning. love the clip notes, they know what to do before i sit down unless i want to change it!"
horrible! rose cut my hair. she was rude and chopped up my hair like one of the previous reviews on here. it was not busy when i went. she was complaining about previous clients while she cut my hair to the other hairstylist that was there. she complained because of my online check in. she did not let me check my hair. stating it was all even. never again. i should have checked yelp before coming here. do not let rose cut your hair!
"force of habit:  i've been using great clips at home in california for years, so i naturally gravitated to the one in my temporary chicago neighborhood .  no surprises.  not busy at 10:00 on a monday morning; two clippeuses on duty, tending to two clippees, out of a total of five barber chairs.  i sat for just a few minutes in the seven-seat waiting area rather grandly referred to as the lobby.  i'm a pretty un-fussy customer; ""lob six weeks offa this"" is about as persnickety as i get.  and the lobbing proceeded quickly and efficiently.  i noticed that my clipper made more use of scissors than most great clips personnel.  i walked out fifteen minutes later and only fourteen dollars lighter (senior rate).  not bad."
"third bad cut here. are we sure they're licensed? do i need to explain what a pixie cut means? first time the dude left it misshapen. second time, lady left one side longer than the other. that grew out ugly. just left the place, i've got the worst haircut i've ever had in my life. i sat down and she reads the notes from last time which should say a 2 and 3 on the sides then finger length on top. she goes so ""so it's a 2 and a 3? i said yes because i thought she was just clarifying razor lengths. she used a 3 on the whole thing and it took 3 minutes. i know it's a cheap haircut place, but when someone comes in with an overgrown pixie wouldn't you ask twice before giving them a buzzcut? don't just look at your ""last time"" notes. talk it thru with the customer. that's my dignity you're messing with. god, i don't know shit about grooming but do i really have to hold miss beauty school's hands thru a haircut? at least i wear a hat at work and don't have to get another for like 6 months.and the thing that's been an issue the last 3 times, they're not paying attention to you because they're chatting with their co-workers the entire time. they just want you in and out. sometimes it baffles me how much people in customer service don't care."
"debbie = avoid. do not get your hair cut by debbie. i love great clips and have been going for years (and still plan on going) but this is by far the worst haircut i've had as an adult. debbie sat me down, and asked me what i wanted. i told her ""i normally have a combover on top but i just want it shortened and thinned out a little, and that i normally do a 3 on the sides faded nicely into a 2 near the neck"". interestingly, she wasn't paying attention to me while i was talking, but i just assumed that she was experienced and she was listening. apparently not. of what i said, the only things she seemingly heard were ""top want shortened"" and ""sides faded"". so the end result is i have essentially a buzz cut on top like someone had gone over it with a 5 or 6 razor (combover completely lost), and the sides are completely buzzed as she went over it with a 0.5 or no guard at all. when i put my glasses on at the end, i was shocked at how short everything was, and i told her this is not what i wanted. debbie responded ""you asked for a fade, this is what a fade is"". i told her that i said i wanted a 3 faded into a 2 on the sides and neck, not a straight up fade. debbie said ""well nothing we can do now"". on top of that, there was essentially a ""military look"" where there was hair on the top and no hair on the sides without a clean fade/transition between the two. when i told debbie that this was way shorter than i had wanted and it's too choppy and not transitioned well, she said ""well you don't have to pay for it if you don't want to"". i said that wasn't my concern, i just wanted it improved or fixed as best as possible in the situation. her response was to turn her back to me, walk away and stand by the register, as if to imply that her job is done and i need to check out. no attempts to fix anything, or improve anything. she literally walked over and leaned on the register counter and started staring out the front windows. of note, she also didn't say a single thing to me during the haircut. no ""how's your day"", ""any plans for the holidays"", etc. she just wanted to get the haircut over with. i believe the haircut lasted 7 minutes total..i still plan on going to great clips, as i've had great experiences in the past. i've definitely let store managers know when their stylists do great jobs and are very personable (i.e. maria at great clips on s halsted is phenomenal). but i felt the need to warn people about this stylist in particular."
"god why didn't i read these reviews first!!! horrible what a joke this place is they should be ashamed of themselves and they're not ""stylists"" there butchers. my hair was beautiful before walking into this place and i should have walked out the min this guy said they don't flat iron or style just damp blow dry. i always go to great clips so i figured this place would be fine. hey jerk off if you don't know what an inch is look down your pants. i specifically said 1 inch not 10. my hair was as long as my arm now it's a little longer then shoulders length. i stopped him 5 times and told him he was cutting it to short and then he wants to argue with me!!! are you kidding me!!!!! then has the nerve to say is it ok do i have a choice anymore.  stay away from this place you give all great clips and quick service salons a bad name"
"want a cheap haircut, expect a cheap result.....i went to see gilma today who gave me what might have been the worst haircut of my life. i don't need much as i'm a 2 on the sides and needed a general trim. my bangs are completely uneven as she chose to cut it without using the brush to ensure evenness. it turned out completely uneven with a gap in the middle. i asked her to please even out the front and she free eyed it again. now my bangs are   short compared to the rest of my hair and still uneven. i'm going to another shop to see if they can fix this mistake as i can't go into a work setting looking like this. if you need a buzz cut, sure come here. if you're a business person, i'd avoid."
"what's so great about great clips, i ain't never goin back againcut my bangs down to the quiff, made me look like a lesbiansittin in that chair with a thousand yard stair, anything to kill timegot a b***** names sally byrd, committing a hate crimei tipped you too, tanya. how you gonna mess up a 4 guard with a 2 guard - unless you're rick pettinos trying to play zone defense.-db"
"luis was fantastic! i was in town for a conference and in desperate need of a haircut, this was open until 6 and walking distance. the staff was courteous and professional, i showed luis a picture of what i wanted and he got it done in 20 minutes, with quick precision. he was a consummate professional and i could not be happier. i've had haircuts that were twice as expensive and took twice as long and were only half as satisfying! would definitely recommend. great quality for a great value"
"less than average. in first place i never felt welcome and was never greeted well on arrival. haircut was decently done - but below expectations. it was a dry experience overall.on review of the recent haircut after the shower, i  noticed it was a cut horribly done..completely uneven on my head and very unprofessionally dealt with..cant believe i even tipped for this..never going back there.."
stay away from luis. he seriously messed up my hair. the couple of other times i am cut my hair here i have had no issues but this time was really bad.
"we went there to get my husband a much required haircut. checked in online beforehand which is great. you get coupon for a dollar off with your receipt so don't forget to bring it next time. they have a regulars card as well where you collect points and you get a free haircut after a particular points value. now about haircut, my husband is hard to please when it comes to his hair but he was satisfied with the cut. we will be going there again surely. i think it's a good place for male haircuts with a decent price of 15$ only. with coupons and points it gets even better."
"went i for a cut before important meeting, the guy who cut it just lopped it off as i wasn't even facing mirror, i always go to great clips in columbus and had to get it recut the next day when i was home. my regular stylist said ""how long did he take, five minutes??? what did he use to cut it??"" she was able to restyle it the way it should look and i will never go back to the one in chicago. had to pay for two cuts in one week but second one worth it."
"the staff was courteous. the experience was the same as any other great clips i've gone too. quick, affordable, and friendly. i was glad that this location was near my hotel as i needed a last minute haircut."
"my hair is easy to cut and i'm not super anal about my hair anyway. the lady that cut my hair never attempted to talk to me, which didn't really bother me but a simple ""hello, how are you?"" would have been nice. she cut my hair exactly how i wanted and was done in about 10 mins. i'm all about saving time when it comes to haircuts. i have much better things to do then sit in that chair and wonder what the hell is the blue stuff the combs sit in comprised of."
they have new staff who i guess are first timers. they are generally good but i had a bad experience last time
john did a great job .. in and out fastreasonably priced  in a good location
"my hair is kind of sad--it's thin, long, straight, i dye it with the same $7 box of hair dye every 6 weeks, and i don't have any layers in it. so i balk at the prospect of spending $50+ on a haircut. this is why i love great clips--cheap, quick, and gets the job done. granted, because i have long hair and i just get 1.5inch trims, there's a very low likelihood that someone can mess it up. i'm not sure i would come here for anything more complicated than that. i went for the first time today to this brand new location, and i'm glad i did. there was actually a 40-minute wait, but they happily took down my name and i left to go shopping for a bit. when i came back, i got right in. amber was a great stylist--extremely friendly and helpful. today they were running a $9.99 special--i'm not sure how long that extends. one of these days, i should probably realize that i'm a ""professional"" and should pay good money for my hair. until then, there's great clips."
debbie was great! i'd gone way too long without a cut (months) and needed a quick cut before an 11am gig. i didn't know anywhere else i could get a quick walk in so i apprehensively went here. so glad i did! i've gotten $60 cuts routinely in the past but debbie made my cut look just as good for $15! plus! i checked in on fb as a newbie and got $5 off! so boom: $10 hair cut and a new go-to stylist.
"needed a quick haircut so i walked in without an appointment and was assigned to this guy..he was so unskilled and clumsy with the razor/scissors, he must have at least grazed my neck area 2-3 times!  at one time, he even grazed my ears so badly that it started to bleed..no apologies whatsoever and he didn't even bother cleaning up the blood..haircut was pretty bad too..wasn't happy with it at all..reminded me why i avoid places like this...i did't catch his name, but he's of hispanic origins i think...avoid!"
probably the worst salon ever. i tried three different people at this place and they are sucked.
"you get what you pay for at great clips.  i've been to them twice and they either cut it too short or too long, and don't bother asking me if i like it or not.  i realize they're one of the bargain basement hair salons, but i've been to hair cuttery many times, and they've always done a stellar job.  the difference is communication, which the great clips stylists need to learn."
"i went to joe's barbershop in chicago for a few years, and while i appreciated the great work by joe and his cadre of barbers, i got to a point where i didn't have 2 hours to give to wait in line for a haircut.i have been going to this great clips for over a year now. it's close to work and i really like being able to check in online and then jump in a chair right when i get there. i've had quite a few different women cut my hair and all have done a great job. $17 is fair price and they have haircut sales now and then, which is nice. highly recommend if you have easy to cut hair and need to get in and out quick."
worst haircut i've ever had. i'm not sure the lady that cut my hair could be trusted with a steak knife.
horrible is the word. a young lady did the haircut. no sectioning of the hair just snipping from any directions. without a doubt it turned out asymmetrical. never going back.
"i been coming to this greatclips for over a year and it's always been a great experience. online check-in is useful, it will save you time! my stylist ariana is absolutely amazing! she is super friendly, professional, and she understands what you want. i will definitely recommend this great clips to a friend."
had a great experience at the great clips at presidential towers. the staff was very friendly plus the cut was great. this is definitely going to be my go to spot for a haircut!
this is my second time coming to this location. great experience both time. first time i had monica and this second time i had ariana. both great! will definitely come back again.
"i'm a huge fan of this place for a three main reasons: 1. the location is amazing for those that work in the area2. checking in ahead of time via the app or their website is incredibly convenient and a huge time saver3. in my experience the stylists there do an amazing job and are super friendlyi typically go after work on thursdays while danny and/or sam are working - one or the other has been cutting my hair every few weeks for a little over a year now and i am always satisfied with how their cuts turn out. i'll switch my hair style up every now and then and they are both very good at hearing me out for what i'm looking for and translating it into a finished product. danny actually cut and styled my hair in the weeks leading up to my wedding in march 2016 and i will forever be grateful, i received numerous comments on how polished it looked. as long as they are working at this location it will continue to be my go-to hair cut stop!"
"efficient check in process with their online app. they get super busy during peak times, like lunch and 5pm, so definitely download the app and check in online. at times they will sell their ""great card"" where you can pre-purchase haircuts for $9.99. if you are regular customer, this is a great value."
"super convenient location. really nice people, you can tell the owner really cares and it flows from there."
"ok seriously all these chain haircut places are the same right?  super cuts, great clips, hair cutlery?  yes!   well, usually...that is, unless  you visit this particular great clips.  i feel these chains all hire the latest licensed stylists right off the hair-u bus, the good ones get experience and move to a  fancy salon.  if thats really the case, this location has amazing campus recruiters b/c all the stylists are awesome!  but, what is more likely realistic is here you have quality experienced stylists and not newbies.  thankfully that means you won't have the roll-the-dice after check-in and hope you get the good one experience - here they're all great!!!  disclaimer:  i'm not 24 anymore and wearing the latest bieber or whatever is trending hair style, nor do i have the same amount of hair i had when i was 24 (damn you propecia side effects...) so all i require is a pretty simple cut and they do an amazing job.bonus: near work and open early and can check wait time online?  score!  did i just get excited about a chain haircut place...? don't tell anyone, mmmmkay?"
"i have low expectations for any kind of great clips, super cuts, sport clips, or any other mass-produced high volume places where guys can get a haircut for 10 bucks. and, yeah i still only go to those places.   but, seriously, this is the worst great clips i've ever been to.   both times i've been there, my hair came out looking totally uneven, and the salonists who work there were super spacey and bordering on rude.   only redeeming feature to this place is that it's close to work. even the great clips on elston ave is far better."
"hair cut was ok however the hair dresser messed up my side locks as she was in a hurry to finish up & attend to other customers. this was my second time so i would not recommend this place to anyone. the first time experience was just fine, hair dresser was a bit curt but i guess it has to do with the fact that this is a big chain so they do not really care. now the second time they have really messed up big time - went there the second time only because i live in pt.will not recommend this place to anyone."
"i'm a fan. great value haircuts for $16, and the barbers are friendly. this venue fulfills both location and speed, with very experienced salonists. on a weekday evening, most of the customers were male. i wish i remembered my barber's name.will be back."
"where do i start. i'm on a student budget and have been going to this establishment for years because the prices are under $20. today was the last time i step foot in great clips. the hot and ready of haircuts has officially pushed me away. over the years i've had a few minor issues but i've always gone back because mistakes happen (and i'm broke) but this is it. my hair is pretty easy to cut. 2 on the sides and leave it longer on top. they save your information in their system because turnover at these places are higher than 2012 gas prices. this lady called my name and right away i knew i was f*****. she was dressed like we were at underground on a saturday night. she confirmed what i wanted (2 on the sides and longer on top) but said ""eh that doesn't look good, i got you"". she didn't ""get me"" guys. this chick went ham on my head. cut the hell out of it like she was salt bae and i was some lean sirloin fresh out the grill. i kept telling her over and over to please keep it long but she wasn't listening. all she was hearing was snip snip snip snip snip. i couldn't jump out of the chair because i didn't want to walk out with half a hair cut, but now i realized i should have done that. i started to give in and looked into her eyes noticing that my displeasure was kind of turning her on. it was as if she took a lawnmower to my head.  i don't know what i did to deserve this. finally she stopped cutting my hair and she ran to get hair gel. i told her ""no please don't i'm about to go home and shower"". she didn't care, she dumped a bucket of pomade on my head and made me look like a jersey shore character. at this point, i wanted to cry. i was about to jump from the seat but she held me down and started shaving my eyebrows( no joke). i started laughing uncontrollably and i begged her to stop. ""nope, i'm not letting you leave here with these eyebrows like that"". i finally escaped fearing that she was going to shave my legs and arms. paid with no tip and ran out. i currently look like a circumcised penis but i've learned my lesson. spend $20 guys. god bless."
"yup i am giving this review 5 stars - as good as it gets. before i moved back to chicago i hadn't paid for a hair cut in over 2 years. my friend was a stylist. she would cut my hair every two weeks if not every week and never charged me for it. i cringed at the thought of someone else cutting my hair - screwing it up - and having to pay for it.well i went to a few places before i visited the west loop great clips. i originally had danny cut my hair. he was good, had great conversation, and was pretty consistent. life wasn't so bad. then one day i met sam. she cut my hair since danny wasn't available. i was immediately in love with the cut. she was great, easy going, and best of all took the direction i gave her and made my hair look awesome.however, its not just her talent that is making me come back consistently. her customer service is exceptional and it shone through during my last visit. my last visit i decided to take a sunday run to do my errands. before i got to great clips i severely sprained my ankle but was still able to hobble to the store front (barely). sam went above and beyond during this visit. after she cut my hair she took a break and assisted me to wal-mart. she insisted i rested while she got the appropriate aids to take care of my ankle.  she went above and beyond and i am forever grateful.thanks again sam! you made a customer for life!"
"lately i have been choosing businesses that are conveniently located to either work or home. this great clips fit the bill and they are synonymous for affordable haircuts. i gave them a chance and i was very pleased with my first trim. jasmine put my previous 30 plus dollar haircut to shame.this recently opened location on madison sits a street level connected to one the presidential towers. very clean as one would expect, brand new build, and welcoming staff. you can check-in online and arrive within 20 minutes and you get to hop the line. almost like an appointment but different. if you can't check beforehand your name gets added to the queue when you arrive. i haven't had to wait more than 10 minutes at this location after work. the stylist keeps notes on each visit so there is no guessing the next time you come in. they pay attention to the details and provide you with what you want. this is important when providing a service and they do it well.men's haircuts run $15.99 and they seem to hand out coupons on the street often. first time at his location? your next visit will run you $6.99. they also offer a prepaid gift card providing 5 cuts for $49.99 and you get that haircut free when purchasing. you do the math it's a good deal."
"i found this gem about a block away from ogilve transportation center, where i work. i walked in and was immediately taken care of. my haircut was fast, cheap, and exactly aligned with my specifications. i am pleased with the results, and will make a return appearance!"
"the hairstylist sam is great here.  she understands what you want.  she is careful, efficient, and friendly."
"i passed by at saturday and asked about something they told me it called "" outline trimming""i went there today and asked for the "" outline trimming "" and told him i don't want to cut my hair cuz i want to grow it tall but he gave me a haircut. i kept telling him that i only want the outline trimming and he kept saying he have to cut a little bit so it blind in. then he called it a misunderstanding and wanted to charge me for the haircut ...i think this is my last visit to them"
worst salon ever !! you would rather not visit this place !! only this store at presidential towers is bad other great clips stores are better !! the staff come up with lamest excuses not to take up appointments ... bad customer service !!
"environment: (1/5)only one employee at the time. there was a man sitting directly behind you in a small room with security cameras, staring at you and the stylist the entire time. very awkward and i felt very uncomfortable.  very small space and felt cramped. service: (4/5)stylist was great.  gave me recommendations based off my style and the products i use. very helpful and was very thorough. appreciated the time she put into giving me a haircut that i liked. pricing (2/5)with tip this cut cost me around twenty bucks. i'm sorry but if i'm going to a greatclips, then i'm going for affordability."
"terrible experience, maryan golzanez a name like this...she ruined my hair!she cut my hair so bad i am very very very very sad with her work. dont go there"
"walked in with no wait. hair cut with alex started immediately and went really well. she was professional, nice, and made me very comfortable. the hair cut looks good too! will definitely be going back."
"i've been coming here for about 4 months and usually they're pretty consistent. however, today is the final straw. today, i think they have a new hire and she completely destroys my hair. i had a combover look and in 5 minutes she turns it into a fohawk/mohawk. wtf?! i told her i wanted a one on the sides and thin out the top keeping the same length. literally i can not emphasize how simple the cut can be. i give people the benefit of the doubt but she just uses the razor and shaved away. in my mind, i knew i wasted ~15 dollars. maria is the only best stylist for men's haircut, but i was never fortunate enough to actually book an appointment with her. but seriously, bruh do you guys hire ladies who says they know how to cut hair and they actually don't? do you even train them? my hair legit looks almost like puck's hair from glee! how can you mess it up!!!!! how?!?!?!?!? peace out great clips."
"terrible. short latino lady cut my hair and literally the entire time would not stop critiquing my hair! yes i know i have split ends... which is why im here. i never once asked her her opinion yet from start to finish she kept making rude comments about my hair cut, dye job, and apparent damage. like calm down, thats no way to treat a customer.horrible experience."
"i didn't even want to give one star. i never do bad reviews but the ""workers"" here didn't have the courtesy to greet me at the door. she insisted on engaging in her conversation rather than assisting the customer. i see why there was no one in the facility. you would think they're closed because the barbers are not working. terrible service. matter of fact i can't even say that because i wasn't serviced. they probably would have jacked me up anyway."
"i highly suggest you make an appointment to come here because you'll find yourself waiting 40-60 minutes after lunch hours. you can make an appointment online and it's super easy. all of the barbers are great and they all have their own ways of cutting hair. my hair style is super easy, i usually just get the fade with a scissor cut on top and these guys do an excellent job with it. it's $13 without tip. you can walk over from uic, or meter park on halsted. make sure you make an appointment otherwise you'll be sitting their bored for an hour."
"bad experience!i have been coming to this great clips (our family) for years and the experience we've had worsened throughout the years (it is close to home). we purchased a great clips card (with discount) and each time when my teenage daughter comes in for a haircut (twice),the card machine does not work. first, they don't tell you that it does not work when you come in, when her haircut was done they told her the card machine is not working and my daughter felt so embarrased (the staff were all just standing around her talking to each other that she should be charged full price without consideration [she can hear them talking like she was not there- rude and without manners]) and they insisted that she pay the full price. second, they have poor choice of staff (beware!). the people who have been working here definitely lack customer service. we will not be coming back. we would rather travel a couple of miles than go back to this salon in halsted st. it won't be missed. i would not recommend this place, you can find other salon with reasonable price with ""fine"" customer service."
"i generally review after a few times to get a better understanding of a business. in general they do their job, simple and quick. i recently had two haircuts there and found one of their employees to be racist. this is a very bad way to treat customers. there are other employees who are mexican who treat customers better. i would suggest great clips management to better train employees on social diversity as they clearly lack experience in communication towards a multicultural group of customers."
"this place is a total joke! check-in online only to arrive and have them take walk-in after walk-in ahead of us. brought my three sons in for haircuts and it took 20 minutes of arguing because i would not register them under their own phone numbers. who the hell are they, the nsa? the woman told me that they need it ""to monitor their haircuts."" i told them they do not need my childrens' phone numbers nor do they need to monitor my childrens' haircuts. then today was the last straw. i checked in online and arrived only to have them take walk-ins ahead of me, again. bye, felicia."
"dont go to this place, one african american woman fucked up my hair.... donot go here, and donot deal with her.peace"
"very nice job. i am actually very particular about my bangs and length. based on the reviews i was hesitant at first but given my budget and the convenience of location, i gave this place a shot. honestly, if you want ombres and the fancier services then go somewhere else. for $13, i was delighted that i could get the same quality and style cut i paid $35-50 at my regular salon. even if it's just a trim and style cut. i had julia and she was great. i waited about 5 minutes before being seen and julia took less than 20 minutes to finish my style. quick, simple and affordable place. but be aware that their services and capacity are limited."
i needed a haircut and found this place while driving by one day at about 11:00am on a weekday. my hair is curly and i wear it medium length. i did not have a wait. fern spoke to me and asked me what i wanted. she took the time to show me some pictures. she gave me a great layered cut. she had good suggestions and was very attentive. i paid $13.00 for the cut. i also bought a good product she recommended for my frizzy hair.i advise anyone who is on a budget and needs a decent haircut to give this place a try.
"i have short hair. i don't need to spend more than $15 for a haircut. came here on a weekday morning where they have a $10 haircut deal if it's before noon. if you come here after then or during the weekend, i believe it's $14. since i'm a guy and my hair is short, it was done quickly and efficiently. if you need a fancier cut and you believe you're high maintenance, go to paul mitchell across the street and do all that head massage and such. how do you if you're high maintenance? one way to tell is check your bottle of shampoo and see if you paid $50 or not for it. if you have a family size head and shoulders from costco because you thought it was a good deal or your mom bought it for you, then this place is for you. fyi, my wife buys my shampoo.   if you like to keep it simple and short, walk-ins are welcomed. it's a haircut. it will grow back if you are unhappy with it. i was happy with after my first visit. as long as they don't spit in my hair, i'm good. i will see all you fellow head and shoulder shampooers here in the future. all others, i'll see you crossing the street to the paul mitchell. who the heck is paul mitchell anyways? he's madonna's stylist or something?"
"for the last 2 years i walk down to this location about every 10 days to get a buzz cut, very simple and quick. the last 6 times i have waited close to an hour and have had at least 3-4 people go ahead of me that checked in online. if you don't appreciate walk ins then take it off your advertisement. additionally i always get a hair cut and shampoo and can't remember not paying at least 25 bucks, because they work hard. they are way to under staffed and i will no longer be coming here. the manager obviously does not care about customers"
i've been very happy with my haircuts from cecilia here.  she listens and cuts my hair better than much pricier salons. and i've had terrible experiences across the street at paul mitchell.
"first of all, why the heck are you looking at great clips! there is a wonderful paul mitchell's *right across the street*. if you need a haircut more complicated than a buzz, call up paul mitchell's and book an appointment with their level 2 trainees (about to graduate). it costs 15$ and will be one of the best haircuts you can get in chicago.so why do i come to great clips? because i'm lazy and don't need to make an appointment. i get a 4 on top and a 2 on the sides and i'm done with it - 20 to 30 minutes on a saturday. even that can be a bit dodgy though (how can you not cut my hair evenly using a freakin' buzzer!)."
"great clips is, as a chain, nothing special.  but today, i was in the neighborhood, and needed a quick haircut.  cecilia was friendly, efficient, and left me with a respectable looking haircut.  here's a hint for folks-- don't expect a $100 haircut for $13.  you get what you pay for.  these quick mchaircut places never promised you a $100 cut.    but, if you're fairly low-maintenance, are looking a bit of a beast and need your 'do' trimmed, this great clips will meet your needs."
"i come here every 2-3 weeks to get my fade or faux hawk done by maria or whoever is on staff.  the girls all have their different methods of giving fades, but the end result is normally pretty good.  they keep your ""style"" in their computer so when you come back they already know what kind of hair cut you normally get.  while the price of $13 for a haircut is high for a fade, they do a good job overall so i can't complain.  depending on when you arrive, there could be a 15-20 min wait, but again it depends if you come after work which could be busier, or just during a weekday (9-5) its not so busy.overall for the type of hairstyle i get, they do a great job."
"just took my nearly 3-year old boy in for a haircut and was very happy with the result.  his hair is fine and curly, and i wanted to keep the curls but shape it up.  the woman (leticia?) was nice and patient and she did exactly what i asked her to do.  she also trimmed my 1-year old's bangs. total cost was $11. i should add that i've always taken my boys to snippets or kid snips in the past (yeah, i know), and this was just as good.  will definitely keep coming back."
"this place is great. i use their app to reserve a spot for my haircut, and i never have to wait more than five minutes after i get there to get started (frequently i don't have to wait at all). the stylists are great at what they do, and they're always friendly. the affordable price is great, too!"
"style: mid-long face frame with long layers, rounded back, and point cut. when i was checked my hair at the end of the cut, sue assured it was beautiful and perfect for me.  once i got home to check again with better lighting, i noticed the back was jagged, the layers were choppy, and no point cutting was used.  so i went back to get it fixed.  sue assured me she did it correctly and used a point cut method.  she kept defending the cut, and saying it was fine.  thankfully, edith was kind enough to fix my hair.  she apologized for sue's attitude, and did exactly what i asked for.  edith made nice conversation and wanted to make sure everything was the way i wanted it to be.  my hair looks great now.  she also gave a coupon for the whole mishap.  next time i'll be requesting edith to cut my hair."
so i came in for a hair cut for my son for school pictures tomorrow. he grew his hair for the past 4 months to be able to get it styled the way he wanted. this lady went took it to about 2 inches from his scalp! i'm so livid! the ugly hair phase he had to go thru just to do it all over again. uugghhhjoel's hair cut came out great. the white haired lady does a great job.
"hi, i visit to great clips once a month. you cannot beat the parking, there's plenty of it.my stylist this time was kristina. i had never had her before. she seemed to know a lot about cutting hair and gave me plenty of interesting advice. in the end i walked out with a haircut that i really liked. you cannot beat the price of a cut here and you never have to wait very long. i liked kristina and would sign up with her again."
"sloppy cuts, don't go. uneven neck line, got one sideburn cut higher than the other. also i've never been able to see the same stylist. there's always new faces. other than that they're fine but won't be returning."
"samantha cut my hair well, chatted up the bristol renaissance faire, video games, and the angst of adulthood. friendly staff and good value. other favorite stylists are sue, diana, and esperanza (hope i spelled that right)."
"my new go to place for haircuts since i moved to bridgeport. everyone is always nice, i always get served quick, the quality of my haircuts are always good, i def recommend!"
"one of the worst great clips in the states. the inexperienced stylist does not even care about what customer says. the just want to finish up early that's it and go home. she didn't even spend 10 minutes for hair cut, according to them greatclips is supposed to work  very fast. she even told me don't tell me what i have to do and don't argue."
"my last visit about a month ago i arrived before 1pm was told i could get the early bird price.  sue cut my hair and when i got ready to pay, she said i got there later & charged me the higher price.  i also heard her whisper to the other stylist to charge customers the higher price.  i thought that sounded rather unprofessional,  especially since i could hear her.  she used to be customer friendly.   she will never cut my hair again.   she always seems to like to use the shaver without asking if it's okay.   it burns my skin."
"i had such an awful experience here yesterday. i have been growing my pixie out for the majority of the year, so all i needed was the back trimmed and i wanted it thinned out a little. i had gotten my hair cut here before by this stylist, i wish i knew her name. she told me very rudely that thinning it was wrong, and i politely told her i prefer how it lays when it's thinned out. long story short i walked out of here with the back 3 inches of my hair shaved and the top left long. i was literally in tears when i got home and saw how bad it was. i was forced to go to another salon to get it fixed and the stylist laughed and said it looked like a mushroom. the only way she could fix it was to cut in back into a pixie. all the time i spent growing my hair down the drain..and stupid me still tipped this woman. the other stylists are very nice,  but i will never come here again after yesterday."
"it's last minute on sunday at 5pm and this was basically my only option. i think this place is only good for simple haircuts. i went in there with hair up to my butt and the shortest length past my shoulders. i specified that i wanted it cut shorter in a simple v-shape, no crazy layers, to have the length at about my bra strap and the shortest starting below my chin. i got off the chair with the length i wanted but the shortest was above my chin. there were basically two noticeable layers-nowhere near v-shape and was not even. i'm not one to complain about a haircut but as soon as i walked out of there i cried my eyes out. never have i ever had such a bad haircut experience. i was told i didn't have to pay and was offered to come back the next day to have it fixed. honestly i'm going to pass. i'm not going to chance it and rather go to my usual stylist. i thank the lady for spending so much time on my hair because there was so much of it and it's thick. but i will never go back to any great clips again."
"the older lady was so rude! my boyfriends haircut turned out soooooo ugly. i asked politely for her to trim the bangs and she questioned if i was a stylist and if i even know about styles. i'm like can you trim it? she raised her voice and said no no no no no no thats the style. idk what style that is, but the haircut is ugly. when she was fixing my boyfriends haircut, she was so rude and kept on instigating an argument. i don't even know why!!! the chinese lady cut better hair."
"this place is unprofessional.  the manager eddy is a thief.  she will take your money for a gift card and not give you credit.  she is dishonest.  the owner marylou pretends not to know that the staff is stealing, but won't do anything to change it.  don't trust these people with your credit cards."
i was not at all satisfied. first- i only went here because it was close and i needed a desperate trim. i got there and the wait was fine.. the staff was friendly and the facility was clean! i checked in at the front desk and asked for a wash and cut. when it was my turn - the last took me straight to the chair without washing my hair at all! (at the time it wasn't a big deal because i had showered the night before.) my haircut took about 5 minutes (which is unusual because i had hair halfway down my back and it's super thick). at the time it looked fine but who really knew.. i got home and went to put my hair in a braid and bam!! my hair is uneven and all these hairs stick out and aren't long enough to complete the braid. the next day i straightened my hair and could see the unevenness and physically had to take scissors and even it out. needless to say i will never be going back here and i suggest you just stick to a salon that you know will provide you with a great service.
"walked in and was immediately attended by sammi. i had a great experience and will be definitely coming back. i had curly thick hair that was hard to manage, especially with a toddler running around. sammi took in what i felt and she worked miracles on my hair. she gave me a long bob cut and made my hair soft and easy to style. it's so light weight and fun. she made great conversation and made me feel very comfortable considering i was cutting my hair short for the first time. she attended to my every concern and answered all of my questions. thank you sammi for my amazing new hair!"
"paid $12 for a cut and wash which turned out to be great, listened to exactly what i wanted and gave me the perfect haircut! thanks josephine"
"alma rocks! not all listen and are as talented, but now i ask for her exclusively. i'm a regular at this location."
"love this place!!! all of the barbers are outstanding and fast, especially edith! overall, this place is nevet busy and always consistent no matter what time you come!!!"
"online check in available. very nice hairdressers. quick quick service. just the way i like it. i also love how they have my last haircut details saved in their system. definitely use the app. also, great price."
"i have curly hair which many stylist have a hard time cutting because they are unexperienced. at great clips i love going there because sue the stylist knows exactly what to do with my curly hair. she understands maybe because she too has curly hair, lol. that helps also i can tell she is an experienced hair stylist. i only go when she is there, keep up the great work sue!"
"the stars aligned on my first visit to this great clips location in lincoln square. i got a good quick haircut from a stylist who was professional, friendly, and polite. and it was cheap.random factors worked in my favor. susana was the stylist on duty. her work was efficient and correct. clearly, this young woman has good training and experience. she's is also friendly, personable, and bright. i happen to like smart people, especially when there's no escape. you know what i mean, fellow yelpers. you're a prisoner in that chair while the stylist works. being forced to listen to a someone's inane chatter, especially when it's punctuated with ""like"", ""you know"", ""basically"", or any other filler words, will drive you nuts. susana was articulate, bright, and personable. i actually enjoyed chatting with her.things that could go wrong with a visit to great clip went right with me. susana was on duty by herself, and she had no customers when i arrived. that was great for me, because i didn't have to wait. but i imagine it could be a different situation if several customers come in around the same time, and there's only the one stylist working. there could definitely be a serious wait.susana mentioned that business is slower on a cold day, and the day of my visit was frigid. also, i went on a weekday morning, a time that typically is slow. i can't speak to how busy great clips is at other time, but considering that there are six work stations, the place must get busy.i paid $13.00 for a cut and blow dry that i liked very much. there is an additional charge if you want your hair washed. it's rare for me to give any business a 5-star rating, but i don't have one single criticism of my great cuts experience.just one thing, which is not the fault of the business -- the parking lot is metered! you do have to pay for parking. that's one thing that has always annoyed me about visiting the businesses in this small strip mall. as a long-time chicagoan, i hate hate hate paying for parking. i parked on a side street and walked a block. no biggie."
i went in with my 11 month old baby today. and he has serious hair growth every few months. wanted to give great clips as try. i normally get it done from another local barber. i understand my baby will cry his lungs out and hates getting his haircut but never has my kid ever had a horrible haircut. the lady at the counter told me how the stylist was a pro at cutting baby hair. my baby's first birthday is around the corner and i dont know what to do. the front is uneven. and has huge dents. the sides are unevenly faded. its a disaster. had another guy complaining while i was there that the stylist went too high .
"i went in spur-of-the-moment because i really wanted a haircut immediately and no one else was open or available before 10 am. the haircut was pretty bad. not quite even and with a chunk of hair shorter in the back. i pointed this out to the hairdresser, who insisted it was just layers. i didn't make a big deal out of it because my hair grows out pretty fast and i never stress about it. but she knew -- she couldn't even look me in the eye when i paid. on the upside, the shampoo included a very nice scalp massage."
"i desperately needed my long hair cut, but my regular salon was closed. i wanted 4"" cut off in long layers and bangs trimmed. i searched around for salons that were open after 7pm. i called ahead & was told i could walk-in. hours are super convenient! online reservations are available. i walked there, but there is ample car parking. extremely clean & bright. very friendly staff. i discussed what i wanted with susana. she skillfully cut my hair exactly as i requested. i could not be more satisfied with the result! i highly recommend susana at this salon. i was regularly going to a small, independent salon for many years, but it closed permanently. i work late, and needed a salon with hours that fit my schedule. i have had my haircut at a franchise salon once or twice in my life, because of convenience, but it's not my preference. i was so happy with my experience here that i have decided to make this my new regular salon. why would i pay boutique salon prices when i can get a beautiful style and great customer service for less?convenient & affordable!"
"great price, nice hair cuts, talented employees. if your hair cut is pretty straight forward, this is the place to go!"
had a great haircut yesterday. my haircut is a bob style and its actually never looked better!! thanks for the great haircut and excellent customer service.
"been going here for a while. really like the girls that work there. they are friendly & accomidating. my hair dresser's name is belkis. she really knows how to cut hair. even thou i moved to the burbs, i will make the trip in just to get my hair cut here. prices are reasonable, place is clean. love it."
friendly staff and bekys took care of me. very professional and very experienced. also friendly and made me feel welcomed. great haircut!!
"stopped in yesterday and had a boy's cut by susana. she did a terrific job, was personable and really knows what she's doing, would give 6 stars if we could! will definitely be back!"
"a perfectly fine place to get in and out for a hair cut.  employees are kind and somewhat efficient.   prices are inline with the going rate for a chain haircut in the area.  place is clean.    you can check in online to avoid the wait, but there is usually not much of a queue even on the weekends.   no free parking, which is a bit of an annoyance."
took my daughter here today for her first shampoo and cut. sonia was great made my daughter comfortable. franchise that feels like neighborhood salon. love app with check in.  parking lot with meters available
"what a great, friendly neighborhood spot for a haircut."
the lady was very nice. she did a good job and i was taken care of promptly. we're good here.
"okay, let's start with what you're probably thinking -  it's a great clips so the cuts aren't that good. and maybe you're thinking that this is just another chain coming to take out the independent shops in lincoln square.and to you folks, i say - you're probably right. howeveri rather enjoyed the cut i received at this location. the shop is brand new, so everything was fresh and clean. the service was excellent (they brought in stylists from other great clips to easy the transition) and the online check in was actually pretty cool. instead of sitting there waiting for a cut, i checked in online and showed up exactly when it told me to and i was escorted right to a chair in front of other people. it's a time saver. as for the not so good cuts, i think if you like your hair cut a particular way or want to pamper yourself a bit, this wouldn't be the right place. but for me, a guy who just wants a short fade cut, it's perfect. i was in and out in 20 minutes, didn't feel robbed when it came time to pay, and left knowing i'd be back."
"i only gave 3 stars because matthew was an awesome person and great customer service! i was a walk in and no one was there so was taken promptly. i gave him a great tip for him being so good at asking what i wanted; however, he cut my hair waaaaay too short! i can tell he knew he messed up and tried to cover it up, but by the end of my haircut, my head looked like a tennis ball with how he styled it. completely way off from what i wanted which was shoulder length hair with texture at the bottoms and swept bangs.  he's an awesome guy and probably cuts men's hair better since he said he has a lot of experience cutting men's hair. i should've listened to my intuition and stuck with my salon with the high prices but great results. the good thing about hair is that it grows... but never again going to a great clips!"
i have nothing but raves for this location!! i walked in and got the exact cut i wanted by jj. he is awesome!!! thanks for my new look! i will be back!
i was in the area running errands. i dont know why but i finally wanted to get my haircut. i walked in and debbie took me right away. she is so friendly and did a great job on my hair. it's a bit of a drive from home but i'm definitely coming back to have debbie cut my hair.
"they have been amazing with my severely dd son. he is cooperative but it takes a few tries to get him to understand basic instructions, and he tends to like to look around and sing loudly with the radio. they are so patient and kind yet his haircut takes no longer than anyone else's and ends up perfect. he loves it so much there that he's become brand loyal and won't go anywhere else. he has specific stylists that even want to work with him now which is so sweet, and they all do a fabulous job.they also did an amazing job with my teen daughter as well, who showed a photo on her phone of some funky cut. i wasn't sure a chain was the place to go - it was so specific and she's very particular - but it ended up amazing, took like 20 minutes tops, and she was so happy with it. she's gone back for variations and every time, it's just what she wants. there is a little section of the waiting area set aside for kids with books, a few toys in decent condition/clean, and the online check in is definitely the way to go if you don't want to wait long or want to check times before you go. i cannot recommend them more highly. just pay the parking...it's pay to park although great clips has nothing to do with that, be aware, that lot gets checked."
not sure what the $9.99 advertisement is but i was told $13 when i asked about $9.99?free parking on sunday yea!
"nice lady to cut my hair! highly recommend if u need something simple and cheap, even a bit complex"
"i got my haircut here once. the people were nice and the woman who cut my hair did a good job for a great clips. if you want a great clips haircut, do not hesitate to come to this one : )also, as always, they accept walk-ins. it's the perfect place for when you must get your hair cut immediately or you'll find yourself streaking or stabbing the person next to you at that cafe with a plastic fork. you're going to be okay."
"three weeks ago, i got a haircut here on a whim and was underwhelmed. the stylist got both my first and last names wrong, even though i spelled them. i asked her to give my bangs attention, but she missed a spot altogether. and something wasn't right about the back...she'd chipped into the sides but left the center long. after pinning up my hair for three weeks, i was tired of compromising. i got a corrective bang trim elsewhere today (which ended up becoming a full-fledged cut), and it was then that i really saw all the mistakes in my hair. my stylist today had to take at least an inch off the back to fix it. i see a lot of good reviews here, so maybe i caught her on a bad day. but two haircuts in three weeks is too costly to take that chance again."
"good haircut but this is the second time i went in there and was assaulted by why trump is better than hilary.  i'm seeing ads everyday and so i don't need it from the stylists to.  and the stuff they are saying isn't even factual. just cut my hair, ugh.  two people left saying they would never go back, and i would make the third in a row.  i have always known never to talk about politics or religion with clients.  these two have no clue that they are running people out of the store with their attacks on hilary and unprofessional political vomit that is completely misinformed.  if any of my employees talked about politics to my clients it would be an automatic write up.  if three clients said they wouldn't be back because of them, they would be fired.  sportclips is just down the street, a little more expensive but i won't be assaulted be political ads."
a big thank you to the hairdressers who were there on 5/13! i went in to shave my head for medical reasons and they handled it such poise and understanding. had to leave quickly with just thank you because tears were coming fast.
"do not come here. i read the reviews on this place, and they were mostly bad, but i just get a simple cut--trim, long layers--so i figured i'd give it a try for a quick cut. the woman who cut my hair was nice, asked how i was, typical small talk. then, her phone rang while she was in the middle of cutting my hair. 1. why can i hear your personal cell phone ringing while you are at work? 2. she stopped, mid haircut to try to pick up the phone call, but she missed the call. 3. she called the person back, and had at least a 5 minute conversation. i was shocked. she came back, and apologized, but i didn't want to say anything until she finished cutting my hair. then, while she was finishing my haircut, the other stylist went in the back and was talking on her personal cell phone, which i could clearly hear the entire conversation.then, more customers walked in, so the other stylist came from the back, still on her phone, and my stylist told her in spanish, to hurry up and get off the phone because there are customers. the other stylist continued to talk on her phone for another minute before she greeted and helped them.my haircut is fine, but that kind of service is obscene, especially when the cut itself did not take longer than 10 minutes, but their conversations were obviously more important than their customers."
"i have used these guys a couple of times... never again. each time i come into this place their first questions/statement is not ""hello welcome to great clips"" or ""hi how are you today"" or ""haircut today?"" rather it is ""did you check in online?"" thats all fine and dandy. and its perfectly ok if you adhere to your own rules. the last times i have been there the person who checked in (person or online) was first. i checked in at home and it said clearly ""zero minute"" wait. i rode my bike and was there in under 10 minutes. i saw two people freshly sat down and their haircuts just begun. i also saw the normal ""check in"" monitor ominously turned off. then the stylist took time to help a customer by hairgel mid-haircut and their day went on. oblivious to their own rules for their own convenience. so two can play at this game. you have lost a customer for life. i will never return to this great clips again."
i've been coming here for years. never gotten a bad haircut (been to over 5 of there stylists). i started coming here when i lived in oak park. i have lived in lincoln park and now riverside and style get my hair cut here. thanks gclips oak park.
"i have been coming here for my 3boys for the last 5 years and the service has always been mediocre but this was the last straw. i checked in at 4:30 from home and the website allows me. i loaded my 3 boys into the car in the snow, arrived by 4:45 and they wouldn't take us for our haircuts!! their website specifically stated that i would be taken if i arrived before 5 which i did. so frustrating. so even though this place is in a convenient location, i won't be coming back. great job losing a 5 year longtime customer great clips oak park."
"i've gone to great clips at a different location and have zero problem. i came to this location after i moved and never again. the staff was fake friendly, and barely greeted me before asking if i wanted a cut. the other location asked what i wanted, if i wanted  a shampoo, and were super friendly. the woman who cut my hair didn't listen either, and cut it way too short. when she was done, i had to tell her that it was uneven. she evened it out, all the while saying it was how my hair was styled so it looked uneven. she also took two phone calls in the middle of my haircut! terrible service."
"finally found my hair stylist in oak park! for some reason all the barber shops in the area charge $30+ for a men's haircut. i get mine done about once every 3-4 weeks and a cut as straightforward as mine doesn't warrant an insane price tag. i found great clips through yelp, went in at 5:15 on a monday and was in a chair having my hair cut no more than 5 minutes later. my stylist, mary, was super friendly and cut my hair with zero effort. normally when i get a trim done, it takes a few days for it to look half decent even with globs of clay and pomade, but miraculously it looked great the moment i finished my post haircut shower. the haircut for a male is $13 so with tip it cost me $16. i have had few better haircuts than this and for the price, it's a serious bargain. hope i can improve this place's rep because it is definitely deserving of it! will be coming here again and again."
update: have since been back and gotten my hair cut by 2 other hairdressers and they did a great job!
"groupon users beware.  i'm a regular.  the cut is usually good- but this one time with a groupon- completely horrid. presented my coupon to the hair stylist- and blam everything changed.  here's what was completely different. 1- did not use the white tape around the neck to prevent hair from getting into shirt2- used a razor to trim sides, and trimmed off top by hand.  however did not trim edges around once, offer to even out my sideburns or use a mirror to show the back of my head. 3- total time for hair cut ~10 min.  previous visits were 15-18 min. 4- barely trimmed the top- i had to ask her to do a little more, which she did haphazardly. 5- did not offer hair gel (usually does). 6- at the end i was going to tip her as i always do- her response - ""oh, i'm sorry i didn't know you were going to tip.  i don't even know how to charge you for a tip"".  another 5 min later after getting another stylist to the computer she was able to charge me- at that point i was ready to give her zero. now, my previous visits- i'd give them 4 stars easily, they were solid cuts.  but with a groupon everything changes.  buyer beware."
i just received a haircut from mary (she has tattoos). the haircut is not bad but the experience was bad. she pulled my hair and gave off a cold rude vibe. don't get a haircut from her unless you're a masochist.
"i've been coming here for about a year and a half, and ana has been my stylist basically the whole time. she always does a great job, and i typically receive compliments whenever she cuts my hair. i would definitely recommend her."
"really like that you can log in from their app. never have to wait. all their staff are very skilled. i'm impressed that they keep track of how you like your hair cut, so your cut is just how you like it no matter which stylist cuts it. never had a bad haircut."
"honestly, i'd give zero stars if it were an option. brought in two 3 year olds for hair cuts. we've been before and have always been very satisfied. stylist didn't take her time, doesn't know how to communicate with children, both boys ended up with horrible, uneven hair cuts, the stylist took less then 10 minutes on both cuts combined. fall family photos have to be postponed because the cuts are that terrible. we will not be going back."
it's where i take my kids for their cuts.  it works.  i wouldn't my haircut there though.   they are quick and friendly.
mary just did me.  she pulled my hair jusst righhhht. ;-)
"is this the best haircut you can find in the op?  no, it is not.  however, the next better haircut costs $35 before a tip.i get in and out of great clips quickly, i don't need an appointment, and it costs only $12!  i pay $15 and i feel like mr. big shot big tipper.the women working there are a little quiet and shy (in my experience), but they don't mess around.  they are efficient and respectful.  they check in with me to make sure i haven't changed my preferences since my last visit.  and if i feel that something needs to be fixed at the end, they keep at it until it is done.one note about the great clips system...  it appears that they store certain information about how i like my hair, such as what length to set for the trimmers.  however, this isn't as effective as the great clips overlords probably think it is.  so many other aspects go into a haircut than you could easily store in a database in a retail environment.  you still need to hire skilled, experienced workers who know their way around many different heads of hair."
"wavered between 3 and 4, nothing fancy, but nice personable folks who give you a good value for the money.  my wife and i both have been here and we think it's a good place for a hair cut.  i would go back."
"america - great mens stylist! why spend $40-50 on a mens haircut? i've been seeing america regularly for about the last 1.5 years. she's the general manager, and is great and super friendly. i sometimes bring in pictures of what i want for a new style, and she goes right to it and does a fantastic job. price is unbeatable, $9.99 if you get in before noon on weekdays, otherwise it's $13.99. i go about every 2.5 weeks, so to me it makes sense financially. also, if you download their app, you can put your name on the list ahead of time and it's much easier to predict your wait time. of course, if you request a specific stylist, the wait can be a little longer than the estimated wait time they give you."
i usually have becca cut my hair (who is fantastic) was not in this evening so pierre had cut my hair.  he very friendly and professional.   i am very hair with my service that i had received from him  i would recommend him.
pretty much the worst hair cut i've ever gotten. i asked for an undercut and specifically told my stylist that both sides should have a part and not be blended. after taking off my glasses and letting her for her work for a while i out them back on to find that the top of my hair is blended my the left side to the right side with the left side being about an inch and a half longer. i pointed it out to her and she proceeded to try fixing it my cutting the right side even more. absolutely horrible cut. no questions were asked while cutting and no affirmation of what she was about to do was asked for. go somewhere else if you want anything more than a very simple trim.
"i go there sometimes for a blow dry. my hair is shoulder length and wavy. most of the time i'm pleased but today i was disappointed.when i got home after running around doing errands, i looked in the mirror and was so embarrassed when i realized i walked around the city with my hair looking like ""i"" didn't know what i was doing. i noticed a big portion of my hair looking frizzy so i put my hand through it to smooth it out when i realized a big portion on the side of my hair wasn't blow dried (straightened)- it was wavy and poofy underneath. my whole head was fine with the exception of one part, which was sticking out.today, i can honestly say my hair didn't look like i just stepped out of a salon. i had to finish straightening it myself. what did i spend $33 plus tip on? very disappointing."
received the worst haircut of my life. this cut is choppy and uneven all over my head. when she showed me my hair was soaking wet and i couldn't tell anything. i'm embarrassed that i waked around in public before i got home and realized this is what my hair looked like drywould give zero stars if possible.also want to point out that my husband got his hair done the same time and his looks great. so when i find out the lady's name who did mine i will be reaching out to corporate and posting it here.
"i had a horrible haircut experience here. i hate how expensive haircuts are, so i figured i'd give great clips a try. my stylist's idea of layering was just chopping off the front half of my hair (i think another reviewer posted a photo that looks pretty synonymous to my hair). if you want anything other than a buzz cut, i would go somewhere else."
the cut was well done.   i'm happy with the price and the good job the stylist did on my hair.   i'll be back.  :)
"to say i had a horrible experience at this salon is an understatement!!!!! i was in the chair about 45 seconds and during that time the hair stylist chopped 6 inches off my hair before i could even let him know that i wanted a litte trim. when i proceeded to stand up as i was extremely upset he pushed me back in the chair and told me he was almost finished (this was 60 seconds in to the appointment). when i starting asking ""what are you doing""  his only response was ""all your hair is dead"". as seen in the picture he not only cut my hair completely off he also cut it wrong, as one side is visibly longer than the other. the worst part of this entire experience is, i have been growing my hair to donate to a child i know who is desperate need of a wig. not only was this hair stylist rude and unprofessional, he robbed this little girl of a beautiful wig.  i have been crying now for a solid 24 hours due to this man's lack of kindness, professionalism and overall respect for his customer.  shame on this establishment."
i got a haircut from elia. it was the worst haircut. she probably doesn't know to do a proper haircut. my hair was cut so unevenly. such a frustrating experience
"hairstyler told my son he supposedly had lice, when he just had flakes from dry sculpting gel. very unprofessional and very loud he started saying he needed to sterilized the chair and his hands. i search my son hair and scalp and nothing, no lice! he ashamed us in the middle of the salon and in front of other clients. we left, crossed the street and went to another salon, they washed my son hair and cut it with no problems nor lice. definitely not coming back."
"elia gives the worst haircuts in the world! stay away!  america (yes, name of another stylist) is very good. go to her!"
"so sad to learn that luis is leaving the shop and going to the old town shop.  he wouldn't discuss why, but this site is losing my favorite hair cutter.  for the price you can't beat great clips.please bring luis back to broadway."
"employees are nice, but act like robots. they won't give you helpful suggestions and won't let you know if something is going to look bad. if you want a simple cut, great; if you actually want a specific cut or style, they will not do a good job. they are not paid to make you look good. they are only paid to cut hair."
"i've lived in the city for a while now, but never ventured out to find a place to get my hair cut. i visited gc a lot when i lived out in the burbs and being on a very tight budget, decided to give this one a shot. i'm very happy i did. first off, there was a promotion for a 5.99 haircut. it boggles my mind people spend over $40 for a cut, but must be nice for them. anywho, rebecca was the one cutting my hair and she did a wonderful job. i brought in a picture of what i wanted, she complemented the style, and went right to work. she asked be how short i wanted it to be a few times, and giving some recommendations along the way. when i've visited other gc locations, i felt as if the haircut was pretty rushed, and while she did get it done in a quick time, she also made sure it was turning out the way i wanted it to. at the end of it all, she also recommended me products, but didn't push me to buy anything from the salon, which is always nice. my hair feels and looks great and i'm very happy. i'm definitely a repeat customer now."
been using them for years. i think i stopped using supercuts across the street because they pissed me off at one time and i wasn't crazy about the hair cuttery either. i never have too much of a wait here either - especially with the early check-in program they have.i'm usually in and out with a simple buzz.
"what a mistake! i went in just to get  my long hair trimmed about an inch, and walk out with the shortest haircut i have had in the last 10 years from a stylist named ""elia"".  i just will never understand how asking someone to cut off one inch of dead ends translates to......cut my hair that is almost to the middle of my back  to about my shoulders, and add layers to my hair that was all one length (shortest layer now being to my chin).:( i cant even bring myself to wear it down because it brings me to tears to even look at it."
when you go ask for katie! she is awesome. the reason for my two stars is generally i have good experiences but i don't know if now i will be back because i went in today and showed the person (not katie) who was cutting my hair exactly what i wanted. thought it was going to look nice because i have a wedding to go to this weekend. the person cutting my hair waited until after i was done to tell me that he couldn't get it to look the way i wanted it to. um hello!? why didn't you say anything?!? i showed you exactly what i wanted and you said you could do it and now i have to pay for a hair cut that i hate and doesn't even look the way i wanted it to. definitely left feeling like i got ripped off.
i would like to take a minute to thank this wonderful stylist names elia. i was so proud of my hair looks in front of my family in this thanksgiving dinner. everyone liked my hair cut. and i promise myself to go back there again... feeling excited :)
i went there yesterday and the left side of my hair is three inches longer than the right!!! besides i had a nicethree layer haircut and i asked to trim the ends keeping the same hair cut.. i have like 50 layers all different lenghts and loos like my hair got chopped wih a machee!! never going back!!!!
i go there if luiz is working because my hair is long & i want it to stay that way. he is great hair dresser.
"was working in coppell last week and needed a trim and the folks at great clips were wonderful. very friendly and fast. i stopped in shortly after they opened and was in and out quickly and my haircut was done well, grant it i just do a quick clipper cut, but it was still done well."
"my normal hairstylist at another store wasn't working today. i went back here to get a haircut. i had to ask her to fix several spots on my head and she tried her best. as usual, i had to fix my hair when i got back home."
"probably won't ever come back to this location. kind of a long wait, and whenever people come in, instead of saying something like ""i'll be with you shortly"", they take time from cutting your hair to walk over to the computer. about 5 people walked in while i was there, and my haircut lady decides to walk over to the computer. just didn't seem like the right thing to do. maybe use a sign in sheet or something?other complaint was they didn't allow me to use my online coupon. so a little disappointed there for paying $19 for a marginal experience. i could have used my coupon at sport clips! get the mvp treatment lol.but really though, i don't care about my hair too much, so i am just going to wait around til the next $7.99 sale."
been going to great clips for years in different states.  this place is okay depending on the stylist the good ones are always busy and the bad ones are really bad.  couple times the stylist had to stop and bring another stylist over  to see what to do next.  sorry not interested in being a testing dummy anymore.
"quality of the cut depends upon the stylist, but is generally okay (not great, but not terrible) for the price.  the last time my son and i tried to get a haircut there we went in about 30 minutes before closing.  the chairs were all full, but no one was waiting.  we were told it was too close to closing for them to take us.  i pointed  out that there was no one waiting, they didn't close for 30 minutes, and our haircuts typically take about 15 minutes, max.  no luck.  i guess closing early for the day is more important than taking care of regular customers.  we won't be back, ever."
i just needed a quick trim so i decided to come to my local hair salon to check them out.  i have another friend who has long hair like mine and who just likes to get a few trims thru out the year just to clean it up.  why pay $40 for that!  great clips was perfect for what i needed done.  i was in and out within 30 minutes and i left a happy customer!  i highly recommend this place.
"first time here. kwi was excellent. this place opens at 10am on sundays, which is a huge differentiator from local competition. waits can get long right when doors open so make sure to do online check-in."
nice clean location with online check in. always get a perfect cut with miss kwi..she has been cutting my hair this last year and always does a great job.
today was my second time to have my hair cut here. the first time i had juan. he was great patient and very knowledgeable. the second time i came i had kwi. she was a lot of fun very talkative and easy to get along with. i am fairly simple when i get my haircut take an inch off six players leave as much on my head as possible. both times have come here they have honored my wishes and i have left happy! enough to the point where i purposely came on to you out to leave a great review for them. i'm not sure who the woman at the counter was who answer my phone call but she was very sweet and nice and talk to us as she was also cutting another man's hair. it was like a big party lots of fun. i left being charged only $14 for haircut so i left a pretty decent tip. i definitely will return and recommend this place to others.
"terrible! not only incompetent hairstylists but no concept of customer service and rude managers! bad haircuts followed by refusal to fix a bad job with an attitude that you are just one less customer. maybe this place is fine for kids or men who just want a trimmer run through their head, but certainly not for women or anyone wanting a decent style."
"not accepting gift card bought from another locationbought gift card (5 hair cuts for $55) from lewisville tx and used for 1 hair cut.tried to use at coppell tx location - was told the card is not valid, so paid by credit card.called customer service and was told the card is valid at coppell, tx but had to pay full pricecalled the salon again to check and was told that the card is valid, but still $15.called customer service back and was told it is valid at coppell and they should be charging only $11don't know what is going on with great clips@coppell."
they do a decent job here for my done who is 9. just don't be afraid to speak up and tell them what you like and don't like. juan is the best.
"i have been going here for a little over 4 years now. by now, most of them know me pretty well. they are all very friendly, and in general cut my hair pretty well. the thing i love the most about this place, besides the people who work here, is the fact that they have an online reservation system. that way, i don't really have to go there and wait for too long. let's just say that i like this place so much that even though i don't live in coppell anymore, i always drive to coppell to get my haircut."
"great service. never disappointed. may be a bit pricey than the other locations, but it's worthy of every extra dollar you spend."
"poor customer service.  would rather try mutt works (yes a dog grooming and specialty store) located a few doors down,  than come back here."
"most of the people that come here are regulars, and most have preferred stylists.  i am one of those that found a favorite stylist.  the staff turnover is extremely low, so a great feeling of ""family"" exists when visiting.  everyone is extremely friendly.  another deal that can't be beat for regulars -- you can buy a $50 gift card and get haircuts for $10, a savings of $20 ($4 off per haircut).  it's like getting 1.5 free haircuts!  the online checkin is also a bonus.  yup, there's even an app for it!  i can see what the wait time is and check in before i leave work, often arriving in time to walk right into a chair."
"went back again for another hair cut. got the same stylist, and everything was amazing again. very quick and i got exactly what i wanted: shorter hair. highly recommended. best place i've ever been for haircuts."
please if you are going here do not let anyone cut your hair but enrique. the other workers just flat out don't know how to cut hair and they look at you and say it's just your type of hair or it's a cow lick. you've been warned. if enrique is not there walk away fast before they butcher your hair. managers and owners should be paying attention to what's going own in their businesses. i won't be going back again.
"check in two of my nephews to get a haircut. bethany came up to the counter and called out a donald that was already being assisted then she announced my 4 year old nephews name. once she realized that he was a little kid she made a nasty expression like she didn't want to cut his hair. she took about 3 minutes to ""cut"" his hair. she didn't even bother brushing his hair nor wiped the bit amount of hair she cut off that was all over his face. extremely disappointed in the service, bethany shouldn't be working there if she doesn't know or want to cut hair. we had to leave without my second nephews hair cut because it was such a bad experience. never again going here."
the only person i see here is kate.  why?  she is always sweet and always cuts my hair right.i like this place because it's pretty nice and not old looking like the other gc'sthe only reason they get 4 stars is kate.  so she better not leave.  it took me a while to find her after my last hair girl got pregnant.
"when he started looking like a girl, i took my teenage son here for a haircut and when we left, he had locks that had been missed.  they were one-three inches longer than the other hair next to them!  when he got in the car, he ran his hands through his hair and handfuls of cut hair fell out.  apparently, they didn't comb his hair while or after cutting it. i've never seen such a thing!  it was horrible.  we went right back in to have it redone and they played it off like all haircuts have handfuls of loose cut hair left in them (as a cook, i'd estimate about 1.5 cups of hair).  someone else fixed it, but no one ever apologized or offered anything extra for the trouble."
"sabrina did an amazing job on my hair.  she truthfully gave me one of the best haircuts i've ever had (and trust me, i've had a lot - from both chop shops like great clips and professional salons like t & g).  she kept my layers long, framed my face perfectly, and even showed me all the spots where the last hair dresser messed up.  sabrina also gave me some really good product recommendations for my hair type, and took the time to double-check her work when she was finished to make sure everything turned out perfect.  i will never go to another great clips again so long as sabrina works at this one, and, if she ever leaves, i'm going with her.  no joke.the other woman who cut my husband's hair (i think her name was darlene) did an ok job, but could have done better.  she left it somewhat longer than we wanted, and it looked a bit choppy on the sides.  if sabrina is there tonight, we're probably going to go back and see if she can fix it up a bit.(update - 05/01/15)sabrina is now the only person my husband uses too.  i think it's fair to say that i'm very picky about my hubby's hair, and she does it perfectly every time.  we never go to anyone else."
"i went in to get hair cut and nancy was assigned to me to cut my hair. it hair cut only took 10 minutes. literally. overall experience was never good, i actually thought she never learn how to cut hair.i told her how i wanted my hair to be done and even in the middle of cutting my hair, i gave more instruction. all of them was taken lightly by her. she never took my request seriously and went ahead with her own perspective of my request. she pulled my hair very hard that it hurts my scalp. also, while she's making a conversation with me, she would hit my arm. she tried to be nice and everything but little did she know that she hit me too hard for a friendly gesture.hair cut like this cost me $14 (excluding tips). i can get it for $5 (tips included) in some chinatown. it's not the level of service i expected. very not recommended."
bad experience today. she did not even clean hair on me. i wont give even a single star if there is am option.
"i walked in and eliza greeted me warmly, knew what style would look best, and kept great conversation with me while she did the cutting.  great customer service! i'm definitely coming back."
"i would not recommend this place to be honest. i have gone twice and have had mixed reviews. the first time i went one of the ladies cut my hair and did a pretty nice job (i get a fade and have them go from a 1/2 to a 3 and 1/2, standard guy haircut). it wasn't anything special but she cut my hair right.the last time i went was terrible. i was greeted by a girl who sat me down and asked what i wanted. when i told her, she walked away and a different girl came out and moved me to a different chair (i guess the first girl didn't know how to cut a fade?). i told her what i wanted and she didn't think my hair was long enough for a 3 and 1/2 on top so she ran the clippers through my hair with the bit on it, but did not turn on the clippers. as the clippers yanked out my hair, she figured out that my hair was more than long enough. after cutting my hair the first time, i found that there were several spots that were very uneven and it looked patchy. she said she noticed it but didn't do anything about it until i saw it (did she just want to see if she could get away with me not noticing?). she cleaned it up a bit more and when she was done the haircut looked ok at best. i used to cut my hair on a regular basis and what she did was at the level of what i could have done on my own. i go to a place to get a great cut, not just something that i could do at home.i would not recommend this place. after 2 times there i won't be going back for a 3rd. good thing hair grows back and i can get this redone somewhere else afterwards."
"$14 a cut?! great for ppl on a budget, like me, and i have been to other locations and have had great stylists every time."
kate is a great stylist been seeing her for over a year now. i have been in on days she has been off gotten a cut and regretted it. giving this place 4 stars and they are all for her....
"a decent haircut... will work for me.  i'm not very picky.  problem i have is the price.  this is going to sound odd... but i've never tipped people to give a haircut.  it doesn't make any sense to me.  charge the fee that you want to charge, and don't expect more than that.  restaurants should do the same, but especially hair salons.  great clips charges $14 for a guy's haircut (mind you, that's without a shampoo before hand, which i got for $16 in georgia).  but i'm not complaining about the haircut.  so if they would have charged me $20, i would have paid it (that would have been $5 cheaper than other salons in the area), and it would have given the stylist $6 extra dollars and he wouldn't have to worry about people giving tips. probably won't go back, as i'm not a fan of strip-mall salons like this.  i'm used to a more homely atmosphere, not so professional... warmer.  (since i'm from georgia... southern, if you like. )"
"the stylist that was doing my 4 year old daughters hair quit working at great clips. went back to have it done by someone else and they completely messed it up. i had to ask another stylist to make it better and she  helped it a little. now we will be waiting about a month for a bad inverted-bob haircut to grow out, then go somewhere else to get it fixed."
"just went in today and got my kids hair cut. fantastic service. the ladies did an amazing job on their hair. my kids are extremely happy. also, super quick service. we were a walk in and were helped immediately by the staff. they are extremely sweet. i will definitely bring my family back to this location. the lady named tina cut my son's hair and a lady named maggie cut my daughters. amazing jobs ladies."
new rowlett location off dalrock...went there with a style in mind showed it to the guy and it went down hill from there. did not realize how bad it was till i went home to blow dry it. i called up there and was told i could see maggie and she. would fix it. i went up there today to get it fixed to walk into the location to hear the original guy that cut my hair talking trash about me. i was super pissed and just walked out went some where else to get my hair  fixed. but because he took so much off i still could not get the style i was originally going for.
"just wasted 30 min of my time! i just wanted a shampoo, blow out, and straightened was told $30 by one girl( very friendly). then when it was my turn the lady who was going to do my hair said it was more like $45. so now my hair isn't done and i am super annoyed!"
"7/23/17 to great clips corp. please consider removing the online check in tool, it's diluting the great clips brand. i have had many situations where the posted online wait times are extremely understated upon arrival and i'm afraid this is becoming the norm. very frustrating."
"the store is okay. never go to crystal she has no idea what she is doing. she can't read the notes previous stylists use. she screwed up my hair. she us d the machine where it's clearly said to use the ""scissors"". i look like i just had a head surgery. she was in a rush to get me out of these. didn't even blow the hair properly just wiped my neck and let me out. i have been going to this location for more than a year. everyone i dealt with were experienced and knew how to read."
"had haircut here for a long time. regular stylist left, tried a new stylist here.  she used an unclean pair of clippers that gave me a scalp infection.  tried to contact the owner and they never called me back."
"i've only been here once and i'm never returning. yes i was greeted warmly and helped promptly but those were the only good things. none of the stylists there were either cleaning or sterilizing their equipment. that's how infections and parasites get passed.and the lady that did cut my hair went way too fast, as well as put in a fade after i specifically asked to not get one. and she left the right side of my hair an inch longer than the other. overall, avoid going here at all."
i checked in online and went in with no waiting. my stylist today was khammy. she did an excellent job; very detail oriented.
"within about 10 seconds of walking in, someone got my name down and told me i'd be taken care of as soon as they could get to me. i literally walked over to the chair, sat down, and sat for about 10 seconds before brandon let me know he was just cleaning his station for me. he cleaned it up quickly and got my name and after that he actually made the effort to call me by it. he made double sure i was ready for the haircut (i've been growing it out 5 years and asked for a shorter inverted bob) before cutting my hair. now, folks, i have a lot of hair. he probably cut about 8 to 10 inches off in most places, and my hair is crazy thick. he got my hair cut the exact way i wanted it and did it in about 30 minutes. not bad. not bad at all. plus he never complained about how long or thick my hair was. he made a comment that i had a lot of hair, but never once did he complain or act rude to me, even when telling me about the screaming kids before me he wasn't dogging on them, he just told me the story and didn't talk bad about the family at all. when i went to leave he said, ""see you in about 8 weeks!"" i will definitely be back for a haircut here. i've never gotten such a great experience from a generic hair place. brandon definitely made it worth the short trip over there!"
"you just created a loyal customer! i walked in here with no appointment (because no appointment is required) and got seen within 10 minutes. my stylist asked me questions that i've never been asked before. at first i was a little perplexed as to why i was being asked so many questions, but then i realized that the stylists are systematically trained to deliver the perfect haircut each time. i've been to expensive hair stylists before, and the cut that they delivered is right on par (and even better) than most. it was executed so quickly, too. my stylist recommended some hair strengthening products to address my concerns of thinning hair. the cost for a hair cut is something like $15, which is a great deal. the best part about this is that they have a system that takes visual notes on your haircut so that every time you come back (to any location in the world), they can deliver the perfect haircut to you. man. i'm surprised i have not heard about you all sooner. this is great!"
"have been going to this location for a few years and have always been pleased for the most part.  today was horrible.  the stylist that cut my hair hurried through the haircut asking no questions about what i wanted, etc.  the hair is cut way up over one ear and the other is down and uneven.  sideburns are just as bad.  there are long hairs everywhere.  she cut way up on the sides and back in the temple.  didn't even ask about the neckline.  it is so bad it is too bad to go out in public!  i don't think she cared and certainly didn't act like she wanted to be there.  horrible stylist!!!  the salon is ok but i will wait an hour before i'll let her cut my hair again."
"my 2 year old daughter wiggles like crazy when i try to cut her hair.  i totally messed it up, but gigi fixed it for us!  she did a great job and was very patient when samantha tried to move from the scissors.  i asked adela to trim up my neck while i was there, and she ended up giving me a great haircut!  we had coupons for a haircut for $5.99, so for $11.98 plus tip, my daughter and i look great.  we will be back!!"
"my husband and son get their haircuts here and they alway do a great job. and, i'm a picky wife and mom about my guy's appearance. they keep a record of the type of haircut that they get, so it's easy for them to walk in and always get a consistent haircut. also, my husband loves the online check in app. it's so helpful because they walk in and are seated in a timely manner."
cheapest place around - there are lots of choices - and quality is ok.  little concerned about the cleanliness - you never see anyone clean their scissors between customers.
"i'm standing in front of the great clips at 9:03 and there is no one inside - what's the point of store hours if you don't honor them? i'm guessing a staff member overslept but the manager/owner has to be all over that. hope to hear from the owner and get an apology.update: someone came at 9:10 and told me to be system was down so they couldn't cut my hair. if they knew it was down when they closed, the least you can do is put a note on the door or something."
"this ls the worst place, they do not care about online appointments at all, the staff is rude and careless"
i have been here few times and found out that hair stylist don't cut hair as instructed. i am planning to change the salon.
my 88 year old mom got a great haircut from sue. she cut my mom's hair just like we asked. we love it. sue was so very kind to her.  we waited less than 10 minutes. next time we will use their app and check in on line.
"owner commented below my review,  he put his spin on what happened,   i have used the online check in system many times before with no problem.   it could have  been faulty the morning this situation happened. i don't know, but  i checked at the right right location and arrived within the time the online system alerted me to be there.   it looks like as i read the reviews, much time is spent disputing the reviews.  it seems the reviews tell the real story,  my review stands.  i was treated horrible by the manager, screamed at by this person and was treated in a very poor manner showing no respect what so ever no matter the situation.  owner commented that its a busy salon, should be with a huge population/economic growth in this area, but as always what goes around comes around, good luck, it will be needed. my original review stands:place a total disaster.  manager screamed at me because when he did not see my name on list of people that check in online.  i checked in online at the right location on time and arrived on time.   rude  rude rude rude,  call 800 number for great clips,   owner did contact me with a less than sincere apology, but spent more time attempting to justify manager's actions and attitude and trying to put all the blame on me the customer.  .      no way,  beware.."
i love virginia !! she does a great job all the time since i sat in her chair 4 yrs ago i am always satified and she is always listening  to my crazy stories and takes her time to inform me about products !!
worst cutting i have done before. i never visit this place again i recommend don't cut your hair
"i was a walk-in, first time customer and they were able to help me almost immediately. the lady that did my hair - carmen - was very professional and friendly. i'm pretty picky with my hair and usually think stylists cut too much of my hair off when i ask for a quarter inch trim, but she did an excellent job. will definitely be going back!"
"this place is really helpful if you are working on how to improve your patience!you go there and think, aah there is one guy ahead, ok i am after him. then all of a sudden the vips show up with electronic ""check-in"" and you fall back in line. i think they should have one numbering system running sequentially for both electronic or personal check-in and just call the number to avoid all this silliness. it's hair-cutting for god's sake; it won't be long before someone creates an app to check-in for toilets, just to let the vips know which urinals/stalls are empty.i've found a better and cheaper place, so my patience is still a work in progress."
"place was clean, but neither employees there today spoke english very well at all, which i suppose is fine... but it is a bit difficult to describe the haircut you want if you don't speak the same language.when i was leaving, i signed the receipt and handed it to her and she just took it without even looking at me and just called the next person up. which again, no big deal, but it was pretty impersonal.the haircut was average, it does not look bad at all, but it was overall not the most pleasant experience."
"this is the place where i usually go for a hair cut. its clean inside but not enough parking spaces outside. all the employees are friendly i would say, not all of them are good at english but they are good at doing their job. this young guy at the desk, i think his name is edward, is kind of rude. other than that this place gets your job done. don't forget to check-in online before you go there so that you don't have to wait when you reach there."
worst service in this place..no point in checking in online . the guys who cuts the hair just screams at you when asked where you stand in the queue ..horrible customer service..i have been to many great clips locations but never ever coming to this place..he says u can just walk away ..how rude is that!!!horrible horrible horrible!!!
"i was very surprised to see that this location had a 3 star. i have always had a great experience at this location. it is definitely busy, so you need to prepare. i always check in on-line to make sure i have a spot, but once i enter the staff is always very friendly. i am in and out in no time. i will continue to go back over and over again!"
"the employees in this facility do a super hasty job and they don't spend more than 7-8 minutes per customer. i was afraid if the stylist would hurt my ears. i've experienced a similar situation at the same facility earlier and thought it was an issue with only that particular stylist. with this time, i decided that all employees working at this facility do a similar job."
"""if the stylist won't take the time to do their own hair very well, imagine what they are going to do to you!""6.99 special mistake!"
they do a good job but they should designate parking spaces for their store. only 2 people inside getting a haircut and 0 parking available.
"upon entering great clips in irving it was clear that cutting kids hair was clearly not welcomed business by the male manager of the store. whereas as most adept managers would welcome 4 clients with a smile, especially considering the hair salon was empty and they have the possibility of repeat business, instead we were greeted by the man with a grimace as he sat... and sat.. and sat. he had no appointment waiting and when prompted to help with the others childrens' hair he remained in repose. in contrast, the female stylist helen was pleasant cordial, and great with kids. since we were  told that the male stylist/manager would cut the girls hair along with helen we were surprised when helen was left with four kids hairs to cut as he twiddled his thumbs.. let me be clear he is infact a hair dresser. later he quasi pretended to count the money in his drawer. when another stylist arrived she said she could not cut the baby's hair as she had a belly ache. and asked helen to do it as well. at this point i commented that it was not right to come into a salon and two very able employees just refuse to actually do their job. the man, who admitted he was the manager, let us know that he was the manager and he could essentially do what he wanted.. just to be very clear the  children were  behaved the entire time.it was a terrible experience and no matter how convenient it seems and how lucky they are as far as a fortunate location the manager does not deserve the business of moms and dads who want to have their kids leaving with a nice experience from a hair salon.. albeit, helen was the exception."
"the wait was incredible. only two employees were working and they sent the third one home. someone who i assume was the owner was standing there staring at the employees and customers. he was also taking our pictures. for what, i don't know. i had to leave and went to sport clips and even got a discount for the problem here."
i just moved to irving from denton where i was a regular of great clips on teasley lane for six years. since i have received great cuts there i decided to look for a great clips in irving. nidia of great clips on mcarthur blvd. was very attentive to listening to me explain about how i liked my hair cut. she also offered a few ideas in helping me grow out my hair while keeping it well groomed in the process. who says you have to spend a fortune to get a great cut?
this place is great! the staff are very knowledgable and experienced -- they cut quickly and efficiently. the price is great as well. i highly recommend this location!
horrible!!! i brought my daughter here to get a simple cut and on walking out realized her hair was uneven we walked back in and i told the lady and she cut more of her hair to make it even... we left and after her shower we realized it was was worse that i thought... i will never go back here again
"absolutely awful place. i would give this place 0 stars if i could. my boyfriend went in and showed the man a picture of what he wanted. not only was it not even remotely close to what he asked for (he pretty much shaved his entire head), but he cut into his beard and left a bald spot in his beard. these people have no idea what they are doing and we walked out of there with a free ""haircut"". dismal and disappointing. stay away from here. literally, run."
i visit this location monthly. i've only had great interactions with the staff. they are efficient and friendly. the prices have gone slightly up but i'm sure that's a company thing and not just this location. usually in an out in 30 minutes. the only negative i can point out is parking up front. it's a busy side and if you go around peak time you will have to really look for a spot.
"i have been going here for the past 3 years. the service really depends on your stylist. so far from my experience, the blondes (two of them) and one black lady were very professional, friendly, take their time to do the job, pay attention to details etc. very good experience through them. but there are few asians working there, definitely stay away from holly, she is very rude, not courteous at all, unfriendly and just after the tip as she races to get it done for more head counts. i had multiple bad experiences through her and she was consistently rude and unprofessional.  i wouldn't recommend her at all. couple other asian ladies working there are friendly and did an ok job but if you really want to get it done the right way, please stick with the non asians."
i was really nervous about getting my hair cut by someone other than my normal stylist but brianna couldn't have been better! i needed my hair to be trimmed and evened out (the left side was shorter due to my trichotillamania) but didn't want to lose my length. brianna was really friendly and talked me through how she was going to cut it and it turned out awesome. my hair is the perfect length and the cheap price can't be beat.
"diana cleaned up my sons hair so nice. she does a wonderful job. the staff were so friendly brianna made me feel extra welcome. the facility was nice and clean. i am defiantly coming back, and recommend you bring your whole family. they know how to take care of you!"
"my partner went here and loved it.  and if he is happy, i am happy. the 2 ladies working that night were super friendly and helpful.  it seems as though they weren't in a speed race or anything  like most of the big chain places.  he is really picky about his hair and liked the service.  he will be going here from now on.  good thing it is right beside the mall for me. lol"
"my husband and children have been coming here for years. my husband works close and takes iunch breaks to get his cuts. he is actually really picky about his hair but needs somewhere he can drop in on a dime when he is free. plus, my hair stylist charges about double for a cut.there are a few good stylists here. kim is the best, she takes her time. james  and vicki are good as well. we love the check-in app! they are quick and very nice to my children, they love coming to get haircuts. we actually live in rowlett and come here instead of the rowlett one because they are so much better. the value and cut is great. look for coupons, they come about 4-5 times a year. usually around holidays or special occasions."
used to come here until tonight when i found out they dont take a discount card for people at firewheel. super cuts it is for on now.
"a good haircut is as good as the experience. it's not about how many you can churn through in an hour, but the relationship each stylist has with their client. with this said, my wife goes to aveda, and full disclosure, i could do the same, but that's not me. holly at great clips firewheel is the reason i spend my money at this location. and i realize that by dropping my favorite stylist's name may make my ability to see her a little less easy, i strongly feel she deserves the recognition. if the franchise owner is reading this, please know you have an amazing stylist that has the ability to make lasting connections, and keep clients coming back."
always a decent cut. for around $12. son like the cuts here so i get mine here too. the app sign in is awesome! you can look to see what the wait is and sign in. most of the time i walk in and they are calling my name.
"if we could give ""zero"" stars we would. do not go to dennis. it is a bit difficult to find someone who speaks english here, and dennis does not speak or understand english. my son clearly explained what he wanted and even showed him a picture - leaving his hair longer on top. dennis did not listen at all (or just did not understand english). he completely shaved his head all the way around, the same length, the same blade, and just shaved it all off.  this is for his senior prom!! there are places all around here that i would pick before i would ever go back to this place. beware!!"
"so iim not a local, but i needed to get a haircut in a pinch.the asian lady (vietnamese) was very friendly and cut my hair with concentration and took a bit longer than most folks, but this was probably the best haircut i've had in a while. not sure if it's because i'm also asian, so she 'knows' my hair texture and such, but she was really good a blending my hair and texturizing the top. if i lived here locally, i'd definitely make her my long term hair cutter person... stylist?"
"friendly,small 3 salon pros 11 am sat.  yeah it did the trick in a pinch."
"would never visit this place...   called on the phone to get information (because i am new to the area) and was talked to very rudely by the guy that answered the phone.  if that it the kind of customer service they have, i definitely do not want them cutting my hair."
"when this location opened up, it was awesome as we were happy with the great clips off lover's in dallas back when we lived in that area. the first visit was great, husband & son got their haircuts & came out satisfied.after their first visit, i decided to give 'em a try as i'm rather low maintenance. just needed a thinning out & 2 inches off. when it was my turn, i got a guy who probably did haircuts in the army. i quickly remembered that i wasn't asking for much so i'd go with the flow. when i left, my hair looked fine and i was just happy to get so much weight off my head (i have outrageously thick hair, hence the need for a thinning).i get home, shower and realize that one side is longer than the other side of my head. the next day i go back and explain the situation. they tried to fix it, but to absolutely even it out, i'd have to get a shorter 'do and i really didn't want it shorter than what i had already gotten. they gave me a coupon for a $3.99 haircut for when it grew out a bit more, they'd be able to fix it. yay for uneven hair for two months!i've always said, 'you get what you pay for', so i really didn't feel the need to complain and poo-poo this great clips location until i took my son. he's four. he's traumatized by haircuts ever since his 2nd haircut when he was 10 months old. the hairstylist was rough and it was just downhill from there for him & haircuts.my son got his umpteenth haircut at this location because the staff is actually nice. i trusted they would be kinder, and i'm sure they would have been if we didn't show up at 8:40pm one night.i knew that it was 20 minutes before closing, and like myself, they have things to take care of outside of work. i totally understand that. i was planning on giving a good tip just for the mere fact that we showed up around closing time. i remember being a waitress and people would come to the restaurant 10 minutes before we closed... it was a turn off, but worth the effort since they always left a great tip. i was paying it forward, in my mind.we come in and i could immediately tell the ladies were ready to call it a day. their attitudes couldn't have made that fact clearer. i figured if i kept a positive attitude, things would lighten up.the didn't. the lady that cut my son's hair was harsh. she was purely angry at the fact that we showed up at 8:40pm. i'm sorry, but you close at 9pm. not 8:40pm. she was twisting my son's head back and forth, not even using the clippers carefully, and he was on the verge of tears. i mean, this lady was in a hurry to get out of there.fortunately, my son only needed a trim, so the traumatic experience was over in 10 minutes, and all those 10 minutes were spent on me giving her the crazy eye. i would've grabbed my son, given her the finger and left... but i didn't want my son to have crazy hair. i just let her do her thing, all while comforting and telling him it would be okay. but i made a mental note to immediately write an angry email to great clips.we paid, and we didn't tip.my husband emailed great clips, and within the week we recieved an apologetic phone call and a gift card for 3 haircuts. needless to say, we used the gift card at the great clips off lavon(which, btw is waaaay better). we haven't stepped foot into this location since that fiasco.point of story? don't go in at 8:40pm, because apparently that's when they close."
"obviously, i don't need a stylist or barber.  i've been shaving my head for five years.  however, i have a 13 year old kid with hair that grows like mint, so i'm still forced to visit random hair joints when he starts to look too mark twain-ish.great clips is 1) fast, 2) cheap, 3) filled with stylists that speak understandable english.my needs aren't vast and my expectations are low."
"i moved to this area looking for a great clips i've used them in the past and was going to continue to use them, at the location it said no wait! on the door i waited 15 min, once i got in told the girl how i wanted my hair cut and was told no i can't cut it that way because i might cut my fingers (point cut). i the long run hair turned out ok but felt harassed for address and info and probably to drive a bit to go to a sport cuts."
"i was visiting dallas and was out and about and decided on needed,a haircut. christy took good care of me. the place was clean, nothing or no one smelled bad as other reviews suggest. i am happy with my haircut and if i lived in dallas, i'd probably come back."
total rip off. she barely did anything. so uneven that using clippers at home would be better. meanwhile the competent stylist was doing fine at the chair across the room. avoid this location and go to the other one nearby. this attempt at saving time has created more work to fix it.
"we normally go to the great clips in casa linda. went here because the wait was 60 mins there, but this one had no wait.now i know why. rude and impatient staff. had to go to another expensive salon to fix the damage. do not go to this location"
i wish i could show you how horrible my hair looks. everyday i get sad when i look in the mirror
i have been getting haircuts from great clips for many years. i have to say this is by far the worst one. i would recommend whoever that's reading this to not come to this location.
why would i need to give you my phone number and email address for a haircut? maybe you're confused about how this works.... i have money.... you have haircuts... i give you money... you give me a haircut. that's all. we're not buddies. you don't need anything from me but my money. thanks anyway.
"i would have gave them no star if that was an option. my husband got a haircut with covi last night & came home & it looks like a 4 year old gave a hair cut. she didn't cut the front enough & messed up the back so bad, i have no idea how she has a license to cut hair. i'm so disappointed & taking my complaint to cooperate. this is unacceptable!"
"normally use the location near my home (casa linda).  used this one since it was near my office.  at 57 years of age, i have had a lot of haircuts.  hands down- this was the worst cut i have ever had.  i have an appt to get it corrected, as much as can be done, this weekend- not at great clips.  clearly there is a total lack of quality control standards between locations so i am scratching great clips off my list as a whole.  one bad franchise location can give the whole brand a very bad reputation.  great clips needs to check on this particular store location."
this is what i get for trying to save a buck. worst haircut of my life. i am literally going home to shave my head now. i am so so so so mad!!!!!
"devanny was amazing she took the time to see what i wanted, and gave a great cut. wait time was minimal, will come back."
"i've been here several times and it's rare to remember the times i had a good experience getting a simple haircut. i always keep ""trying""and hoping i would get someone good. all i need is a simple haircut and for whatever reason they can't deliver it.  i just can't come here anymore - it's very convenient since i live nearby but it's tough; i will try somewhere else.guys... avoid going late in the evening. the good stylists work at normal hours - the bad ones work more until they close (especially on weekdays). avoid them!!!"
"met a nice lady in the am shift today. i like my hurcut. haha i was laughing out the door, she's really nice. :)"
terrible. uneven cut. a patch of long hair in the back. didn't even take a minute to wipe hairs off the back of my neck. woman even smells bad.
"kid haters (or racist)  at this salon. i went in tonight and waited in line behind a hispanic dad with his three sons. the dad asked the stylist to even out his child's sideburns, which the stylist did. i saw the dad tip the stylist ten dollars then leave. i was then called over to the chair. i reluctantly sat down in a chair that was above piles of cut hair underneath. as soon as the clippers hit my head, the stylist opened her mouth to say how much she hated cutting the hair of the kid before me. she said the dad always calls her attention to the ""stupid sideburns.""  the other stylist defended the father and proceeded to clean her area waiting for the next patron.  someone entered and sat in the other stylist's chair. i overheard her ask the gentleman if he was new to the area and if he had kids. he said no and she said good because he did not want his kids in disd. i spoke up at that point and asked what that comment was about. she said that several of her customers are teachers and that they all say the kids are bad because the parents do not parent their children. she went on an on about how bad the parents must be. i suggest that all parents in the area take their kids for haircuts elsewhere since the stylist at this salon apparently dislike the parents correcting a bad haircut and the stylist must believe that the kids in disd are all bad since they spoke of such with conviction. oh and my haircut - terrible!"
"went in for a trim, and just a little bit of layers. what can i say? you get what you pay for. when i got home, i washed my hair and straightened it. yeah.... it was uneven. i had about five inches trimmed off, and there was a little part that was still not cut off. some parts were uneven so i had to cut it myself. i can always curl it or style it some other way to show less of the uneven. i hate getting my hair cut. it's a yearly thing or when i get a lot of split ends. i've paid more and had the same experience, which is why two stars and not one. i'm just glad that hair grows back."
going to great clips is like rolling the  dice. you never know what your going to get. i can tell you exactly what you can get at this location bad service! bad hair cut! unless you want extensions then you might be fine
this is the worst haircut experience i've ever had in the 27 years of my life. i got a haircut here yesterday and these people razor burned the entire back of my neck when straightening it up. the entire back of my neck has burned ever since and i could barely sleep with how painful it was and still is.i would not recommend this place to anyone.
"i had an absolutely horrible experience here. if ever you have to get your hair cut here, please, please avoid the short black lady. i was screaming inside while she was doing my hair. it took her no more than 5 minutes(not an exaggeration) to do my hair. neither one of her short arms could reach the top half of my head, and she didn't even try to put effort into cutting my hair on both sides. to be honest, a chimpanze can probably do a better job with a couple minutes of training. this is seriously the worst hair cut experience i've ever had."
"i once again had a great experience at this great clips in richardson. be sure to request lisa she is awesome!! very professional, timely, and sweet! lisa always remembers the style i prefer and i'm picky. the staff keeps the place clean and is always so courteous. do yourself a favor ask for lisa and enjoy a fantastic haircut experience!!"
"went in sunday with 5 people to get hair cuts, 3 where great 2 not so much.  the woman i had could not understand what i was telling her and i did not get what i wanted. my daughters hair was not done as i wanted, was told it would look like a boy hair cut, but since she had cut her hair by her self ( the 4 year old ) she needed the shorter cut to even it out so i paid for her to get a trim ( waste of my money).  the three boys where perfect."
absolutely awful!!! i have tried this place 3x. they must be hiring the stylists at the bottom of their class. i asked for a low fade and even pointed out where i wanted the line to be. she shaved the side of my head. i asked her to stop and got up and left
walked in yesterday after going to sweet & sassy at firewheel and getting declined for not having an appointment. had a great experience! thank you for my son's first fabulous hair cut! major looks so handsome! thank you pretty lady with those awesome green nails!!
"we've taken our toddler there several times and always had a good experience, until our last visit.a lady named kiwi or kiri, not sure, cut his hair. she didn't have much patience like the other ladies have had and left our little boys hair so short and uneven that i have no choice but to wait until it grows to try and fix it. just terrible. at that my little guy does very well when getting a haircut he doesn't move a whole lot and cooperates more than the average toddler would. very disappointed. i usually don't write negative reviews but i can't help but regret going into this salon the day we did."
"i informed the person i wanted a trim. bethany, decided to start cutting without clarifying. i felt like a big chunk was taken off and i asked how much  are you taking off? she replied two inches and i asked what, i said a trim. she said that is a standard trim.  far from a trim!!! every other trim i have had is defined by a half inch to and inch. and then she proceeds to tell me it makes your hair grow faster. lie. trimming your hair has nothing to do with the follicles at my scalp. trimming helps it make healthier as it grows. ridiculous. reminds me why i haven't got my hair trimmed by incompetent people at great clips in years but with the time crunch of getting to a wedding i could sneak by with a trim. apparently not!!  i would give zero stars if i could. bethany - next time ask what the definition of a trim is to your customer before you start cutting."
"i went to trim my nack hair into straight line. the stylist, kiwi hiwi, said she need to see my neck so she open the cape??!! the hair was not even long enough to touch the cape yet!! so all the hair fell onto and inside my clothes!!!! i told her kindly that no one does that. she didn't listen. after she said she was done trimming, my hair was still not in a straight line!! i found untrimmed hair like 5 times and told her to trim it. this is the worst experience i have ever had! she felt no shame and charged me full price!"
i like to have haircut at this place. it's a good place with affordable price.
"there is about a 50% chance you will get a great clip here... ive been here 4 times and there has been completely different staff every time i come here. i was here last wednesday,  went in and was told they are only taking cash. i went and got cash, came back and there were 3 people that had just arrived.. one dirty homeless looking guy. the lady i just talked to ( tattoo titties hanging out giant giant hair) put me at the end of the line..i told her i had already been there and just went to get cash.. well she still put me at the end, now i have to wait even longer and go after the nasty guy! no thanksi don't know who manages this place.. but this day in age to not have your credit/debit fixed by 3pm  is just sloppy"
"i've come here a few times now, and they've become my go-to for a good haircut! i've never had a long wait (i always come after work on a weeknight), they keep track of how i like my hair done, and they always do a pretty good job."
"i went here last thursday and it was almost completely empty only one customer and about three workers as soon as we walked in the lady (katherine) asked for our number and since my mom doesn't  know english she said ""huh"" and she yelled ""your number"" ok well that doesn't really matter i kinda just ignored her i went inside to get a haircut and i told the lady ( with purple hair african american )i want about 6 inches cut off and i showed her with my hands about how much i want to be cut off  then she took me to the back and she wet my hair after we came back from wetting my hair she asked me 4 inches right? and i said yes assuming  she knows what she's talking about so she started cutting my hair and i don't even think she tried to communicate with me once instead of her saying ""you have a lot of hair child"" but that's fine so she cut my hair and she cut my bangs the right way ( thank god ) and when she was done she gave me a mirror as soon as she gave me the mirror i had realized she had cut my hair at least about 10 inches instead of "" 4 inches"" according to her but you know what at the end of the day i liked my hair even though it was way shorter then i had thought and i don't recommend this place if you are extremely picky about your hair"
"i am so disappointed in the way this store treats customers. i took my son tonight for a back to school haircut, and took my two year old daughter with me. we stood by watching my son, taking picture to commemorate this occassion. my daughter stood close to me quietly singing or dancing while we waited. three fourths of the way through the stylist gets a call from her boss. apparently the boss drove by and saw my daughter. she told her employee to tell me to ""keep my child seated in a chair and get her under control"" i can not believe the audactity of this store manager to dictate to a parent, when they can not even see or interact in person to correctly assess the situation.i will never return, and i will be quite vocal on how poorly i was treated."
great service!!! fast and friendly staff and i love the clean environment!! all the lady there are nice and the price are awesome!!! it's so convenient for me. this location is right by my house!!!! all the stylists are so helpful when i needed to purchase products!!! i just love everything about this salon!!
"in my quest for the perfect cheap barber in dallas, i've found good & cheap here, but still finding barbers who ask you what you want, and then cut your hair the way the want.the good:  quick service, good basic haircut, facility is clean, inexpensive. stylist was nice. the not so good: i asked that my hair be left the same length in the back, this was basically ignored. hair grows back so no big deal. if you want an inexpensive, good, quick, no frills cut, this is the place."
almost never busy and the haircuts are reasonably priced. i've never had a bad experience here.
"this place can be great, it depends on who you get. i've had good experiences with everyone there except katherin. i think shes the oldest one there. i've been nice about it and let her cut my hair more times than i should hoping she knows what shes doing but i've come to realized either she just doesn't know how to cut hair or shes super sloppy/lazy at it. she really screwed it up this time. if the place wasn't so close and i didn't have a $50 haircut card (which only works at the one you bought it at), than i'd go somewhere else. katherin is also not great at taking criticism or following any kind of directions, she seems like a nice person, but she just doesn't know how to cut hair or wants to be done so she cuts corners (pun intended). when i came home and rinsed and dried my hair i noticed it was uneven with parts of it sticking out all over, i probably would've noticed earlier but she likes to rush you out the door so she can get back to sitting.from now on i'll be sure not to let her cut my hair.  if it wasn't for her i'd give this place at least 4 stars."
"terrible,terrible,terrible!  will never go back.  cut my hair and didnt even blow dry the hair off of me.  just removed smock and said you are good."
"i would not recommend this place to anybody . these people don't have any idea how to cut hair , they did a really bad job to my kids . i ll never come back again. no more that one star is worth!!"
"i had a fantastic experience at this great clips! let me start by saying, i have been going to a stylist in uptown for 3 years who i still really like, but i can't bring myself to pay $80 (with tip) for a hair cut! i also live in northwest dallas now, so needed something closer.i was desperate for a cut and found this location via yelp with good reviews so decided to check it out. i was very nervous and anxious but i had to try! i went on a sunday afternoon and got right in, my stylist was phal (if i remember correctly). she listened attentively to what i wanted and it turned out great! i have naturally curly hair, but soft curls, not super tight curls. if it is cut bad, it's hard to cover up. i have a bob style and just needed a trim and she nailed it. $24 included my wash and cut with tip! hard to beat and i will definitely be going back. i feel like great clips can get a bad wrap from time to time, but if you have been on the fence about a cheap haircut, give this place a try!"
"i seriously don't think anyone here truly knows how to cut hair, my boyfriend and i went in today to get our hair cut. i asked for my split ends to be cut high so they don't grow back, i asked for 3 inches off. i got maybe a half inch trim and still have split ends when i left. they didn't do my boyfriends hair at all like he asked, they practically made him bald around his ears and didn't blend the hair on his neck at all, it looks like half bald to long hair. unless you just want a shitty little haircut that you have to pay 15 dollars for, i'd say go somewhere else."
"great consistent experience with chad. i had my hair cut here by other stylists too and no problems at all.just wish there was an online schedule, so that once you get to know a stylist you can just schedule online or on the app instead of having to call in."
"doesn't deserve a star at all. won't ever come back to this location. i checked in online since the normal location i go to was busy. i went in, they said ""welcome to go great clips"". so since everyone was busy and no one came to the counter, i sat down and waited (my name already on the list). a gentleman walks in, gets taken back immediately. then a lady comes back to the counter and asks if i'm getting a cut and i told her yes i checked in online. she responded, quite rudely, that next time i need to let someone know and not just sit here. to which i stated that when i came in, no one came to the counter so i sat down to wait. she then takes me back. i'm only getting a trim. she makes me stand during my haircut (b/c she states my hair is over the chair) which i have never had to do for any reason!! then she doesn't even let my hair properly. she just pulls it all to be back and cuts it straight across and says ok you're done! i've had plenty of haircuts and nothing like that! i had to tell her to trim the front part of my hair too. to which her response was, oh you want me to cut that too? uh, yes dear, last time i checked it was part of my hair and i came in for a hair trim. i will be going back to my regular location for them to fix the mess this woman made. how can anyone make a trim look horrible??"
"i wish there was a zero star. 1. for the price- hair styling and blow dry is extra $25 versus fantastic sams and super cuts charge only additional 5-10 dollars max. 2. hair cut was worse. shape of hair is uneven both sides, inspire of me pointing out to the guy who did his haircut. another member had a similar experience. the guy who cut his hair has sweaty smelly hands... overall a nasty place with zero stars...avoid this place if possible.."
"went in early on a friday and got my haircut by a complete stranger! julius took my ratchet outgrown pixie cut (i've been calling it my mullet if that helps you get the picture) and turned it into an adorable bob! i didn't show him any pictures, i just said make it look better and he did! amazing haircut in less than 30 mins for half of what i would normally pay!"
"jazmine is amazing the only one in dallas that has been able to ""cut into"" the front of my hair symetrically.make sure to schedule an appointment she only works 2 days a week."
"jeanne the manager is a doll!  she has turned around this location and it shows.  with the great attitude of the staff and the quality of the cuts - you have to do a double take...""i'm at great clips??""  what!?  they remember your name and treat you like a vip.  this is where i'll be going from now on.  kudos to jeanne and her team."
"maybe it was just this location but the haircut was below average and the lady who cut my hair had zero interest in being friendly. i asked her the standard haircut questions, how is your day, how long have you been cutting hair, are you from the area. answers: fine, 30 years, yes. i felt i was an inconvenience to her day. i will never go back here."
i am loving my haircut from great clips!! almost everytime i have tried to get layers in my hair the stylist has never cut it right.  this time however they got it so right!!i had my hair cut by jeanne and she did an amazing job!  i will definetly be back in the future!!! thank you jeanne!!
"quick , efficient service. i went with jeanne. she is very polite , friendly , great customer service. she said hi to everyone who walked in. gave me a nice haircut, did not push me to buy products. would definitely come again. $20 with tip , who can beat that?"
i got my cut from diane. she is really good and understands what you want. i would definitely be coming back.
"solid $14 haircut, i've been looking for a local bargain place to get a stylish haircut for men. i definitely found it here this place is super updated on the inside and staff is pretty knowledgable of what they're doing. i got my cut with darlene i believe, needless to say i was content with my haircut i will be back."
"many people look down on chain places like this. you tell them what you want or if you want it the same as last time they save it. i love the online check in on the app. they always do a good job for a fair price for me and always take time and care with my hair focusing on the details. i love this place and have been using this franchise for a while, but this location is always above and well beyond others. good stylists and kept running this well by excellent management probably goes up to the owner. this will now be my only location i visit. they take care of me well. thank you. please stay around with superb service for a long, long time."
"having shoulder surgery and not able to use my right arm i have been getting my long hair washed and flat ironed.  today, being in a hurry and not able to get to the salon i typically have been going to , i made the mistake of choosing great clips in addison,texas.  i checked in  when i left my house and my wait at that time was 15 minutes. but, when i got to the salon i waited an additional 30 minutes before being served. then,  incompetent stylist, an older hispanic woman, soaked my back while washing my hair and then put the soaking wet towel back on my neck and shoulders. i made her take it off. then unbelievably, she could not figure out how to turn on the flat iron  and had to get help from another stylist.  from there i knew i was in trouble.  she barely dried my hair and started to attempt to use the flat iron,which if you know anything about flat ironing, would have fried my hair. fortunately, i looked over at the manager, darleen, who came over and tried to help the stylist at which point i asked to just dry my hair and let me out of there.  my stylist couldn't even pull that off and the manager again tried to help. at this point i just told them to finish drying my hair without styling. at the checkout counter the stylist tried to charge me a for a shampoo and full blow dry/style until the manager told her that she couldn't do that and only charged me for a shampoo.  i have never not left a tip but this time i refused to. in addition, i have been to several upscale salons in the dallas area and have paid a reasonable amount for the same service. had this experience gone flawlessly, at this low cost chain salon, the cost they quoted me when i got there would have been for the shampoo and then another $40.00 for the flat iron which is an outrageous amount of money!  i plan on calling corporate office of great clips on monday and sharing this with the district manager. awful, awful experience!!"
"i've been going here since 1997, yes, that's 14 years.  why do i keep going here?  because i'm a creature of habit and don't like change.  i know what to expect and my expectations are almost always met, sometimes exceeded.  when i was unemployed and volunteering full time, the stylists wouldn't accept a tip from me, that's probably a pretty good reason too.at regular price, the haircut is a little pricey.  but i almost never pay full price.  previously, they had a $50 gift card that you could get a free haircut, so it was, 4 haircuts for the price of 3.  not too shaggy, i mean shabby.  they stopped doing that and went to the $9.99 unlimited haircut gift card.  buy as many haircuts as you want for $9.99 but they had to be purchased before a certain day.  i bought 10.  recently, they had a card that gave you two free haircuts in april, deeply discounted in may, somewhat discounted in june, so on so forth.  not too bad, plus you can get coupons in the money mailer for $6.99.i've seen many a hair stylist come and go and i'd say the experience and talent of the stylists has remained the same.  some are better than others, but i'm not too choosy.  i'd rather get in and out quickly, than wait for a particular scissor.  my hair has never been messed up, but it has been cut shorter than i wanted.a couple things i've learned here.  cowlicks can only be mitigated, not eliminated.  hair paste is much better than gel (at least for my thick unmanageable hair).  if you come into the shop with a hat and are all sweaty, you get a free rinse!"
"great place to go if you want to get your hair cut and be treated by rude staffhaircuts are ok, staff is about as rude as you will find"
i got a hair cut here yesterday and i asked for a trim. she didn't wet my hair to cut it and i have wavy hair so that obviously isn't gonna work. my hair cut was done in about 7 mins and it is not straight at all
"as with any place like this, you can get good and not so good.  ask for tiffany. she has cut hair for me and my sons for the last several months and done an excellent job."
been going here since 2007. it's going to be my last visit here today. worst haircut of my life last two times. my 'hairstylist' today was someone brenda torres. last name torres for sure. it was 2 pm and not even crowded to think she may have done it to get moving faster. i have attached a pic so you would realize what messy job she did with the sides. my haircut was complete in less than 4 minutes. all she asked me was if i wanted to buy those conditioners and gels they display. i know it is great clips and can't expect anything good - but can you at the least cut the hair like an average grade barber?can't wait to have my hair back and go to a better barber. thanks great clips for ruining it. not giving you a chance ever again.
"one of the worst saloon. the guy who did the hair cut was very fast and started doing in his own style, despite i told him my style at the very beginning. i don't recommend."
"been going for a while.  at first watched and observed who people were requesting.  most ask for cee.  since i've been going to cee, have always had good cuts."
"unfortunately this place is getting very greedy. not only have they increased their prices, but they're now getting rid of both the utd discount and the $9.99 haircut cards. they say they're more of an ""upscale"" salon, so that's why it's more, but as you'll see from other reviews the service is on par with salons like the ones you'll find at walmart."
please don't go to the arab or indian or mexican looking lady there. she just cut off my side burns without giving me opportunity to do anything. i am so furious right now.
i been coming here for years and they are always appreciate me  coming here. i recommend this place to anyone. you can always online check in too since place is always packed with utd student.
i have blunt cut bangs that needed a basic trim. the lady who cut my hair named bunny gave me the worst hair cut of my life. she had nooo idea what she was doing. she tried to layer it? when i really did not ask for that then there are just huge chunks out of my now super short and uneven bangs. she tried to send me on my way when one side of my bangs was a whole 21/2 inches longer than the other side. i politely asked her to even them out. man did i make the wrong move by asking her to touch my hair again because yes she cut the long side short. really really short. . i asked her to leave my bangs touching my eyebrows and they are now half way to up my forehead and too short to even clip back to hide this horrid job. if a little asian lady named bunny tries to cut your hair. run out the door. she is awful.now i have to live with this horrible excuse of a hair cut. seriously didn't even know it was possible to mess it up this bad. i wish i could post a picture. it's almost comical.
it's not too bad as most of yelpers comments. don't forget the price is inexpensive. impossible for you want everything with low price.
"i've been a customer here for the last 13 years, but not any more.  the online checkin app is a complete joke.  it will tell you there is a 1 minute wait, then you will show up and wait for 20 after you checked in online.  i would say my last three hair cuts have been bad, and have gotten worse each time.  today, i had an asian lady (not that it matters... many of the good stylists i have had over the years are of asian origin)...  but this one could not speak english well enough to do her job... i would ask her a question like ""are you making it straight in the back"" and she would answer with ""thank you""...  um... what?   hair cut was terrible, but i couldn't explain well enough what i needed done.walked out frustrated and i think it showed... one of the regular stylists stopped me to ask if everything was ok...  i just asked if i could have a brush to brush my hair (which was still dripping wet), paid (no tip) and walked out.  won't be back.  you shouldn't be back either."
horrible service!!! if your not a man do not go here as they will rush through your hair cut to make more money! they will not even wet your hair prior to cutting it! to top it off when i asked to have someone else finish the hair cut on my child the employee hit me on my hand and began to scream!! when i called to speak with a manager they blew it off! bad service!
i have been going here at this place since last 1.5 years and every time i have returned with a shabby haircut. the only good thing is you get a utd discount. not going there henceforth now!
nothing extraordinary about this place. my hair has been messed up a couple of times. the bald guy is good. you get some discount if you are a utd student (that's probably the best part).
i have been going to this place for years and britney does a great job! most of the staff is the same since i have been going so that's always a plus and they all do a great job! britney is the bomb though she will give some great advice when your not sure what you want !
"i've been here twice and i absolutely love this place! the first time i came in i was 8 months pregnant and had my toddler with me, my stylist was so patient with my baby (she was getting antsy because it was nap time). my hair was so long and i just wanted to chop it all off. she gave me the best haircut, just like how i wanted it. and today i went in to get a trim because my hair had gotten long again. and i had the perfect experience once again. i totally recommend this place. clean place and the staff is super friendly"
"the woman here are so classy and beautiful in their physical and spiritual appearance.shout out to brittany, keisha, ann maria, loren and marlene . they are so kind and loving towards me when i go there. i've been blessed by them. may god continue to bless their business. love you ladies"
fat lady with pink hair was so rude. literally kicked my kid out because he was slightly upset and crying even though he wasn't moving or refusing to be cut. he is slightly autistic and upset with noises and the lady not apologetic and said find business elsewhere. extremely rude. never go to this location.
"the hair stylists are great people but at the end of the day, my hair is crooked. i asked for a three inch trim and normally go to a great clips type place if i'm not doing anything drastic. i ended up with 1.5 inches cut on the left side and 2 inches cut on the right. kind of guesstimating those measurements, but the point is that one side is definitely longer than the other. the hair isn't even on each side either so it's really an all around disappointment. i'm too scared to go back and get it fixed for fear that they chop off more with the same janky result."
i went in for seriously one of the easiest haircuts someone can do... a trim. i have long hair and i wanted 2 inches trimmed off but after looking at it closer when i got home i noticed the guy who cut it wasn't able to cut it evenly. you can imagine my frustration. i wouldn't recommend this place.
"i have been in dallas for 8 years, before that i lived in san diego, ca and had the same hair dresser for 18 years. i have been back to san diego for a visit and returned to my hair dresser but my visits were few and far between. i have tried several different stylists in dallas but none of them seem to know how to cut my hair to my satisfaction, at least until i went to great cuts. the lady there did a great job. she listened to what i wanted and did exactly what i requested. their prices are reasonable and they have a senior discount which is a plus on a low income."
i went for a shortish hair cut but the woman cut literally all of my hair off and made me look like a child. when i asked her what she was doing she said she was going to go as it develops. now i have a hair cut that is nothing like i wanted and never recommend going here. horrorible experience and doesn't listen at all.this woman should not be cutting hair at all. don't go here if you want your hair cut not to go right.
"in and out in less than ten minutes. half of the haircut timing was spent stylist/butcher chatting to another. my hair style instructions said a little on the top, and yet 1/3 of the length was chopped. very unpleased and unhappy"
"worst corporate policies ever.  can't even go in to set an appointment for the person you want to cut your hair, no times for when available and most of their stylist are new and do not know how to properly cut hair.  i want the only person there who has ever cut my hair properly but can't get her standard working hours as great cuts changes them all the time, can't ask for her online as that is not an option, can't go into the facility to make an appointment.  worse customer service by a corporation ever!!!! do not use!!"
"about a month ago, i had posted a negative review about this place.however, they have changed my mind today, and i need to fix my comment. i guess i just got bad luck when i was there last time.the manager not only give me a free hair cut, but she also makes sure that i got the best person in the store to fix my hair, even after a month ago. of course, every staffs are talented and have amazing study hands. they will cut and fix your hair on point ... i don't write this review because they give me a free hair cut. i just thought those hard working stylists should be appreciated and customers should come to this place if they wanna get their hair done in the best way. i wish i had known every hair stylist's names... so, i could list the best ones and prefer to the new clients. as i said, most of people, who work there, are great. so... if you did have bad experiences, like me. don't abandon this place. just come back, talk to the manager. she will fix everything for you and you won't be sorry. i just can't stop smiling at my new hair"
i've gotten a hair cut from every staff member.  most do a good job.   nothing to complain about here.  staff is very friendly. my suggestion is to open up yourself as a customer and you will get great service.  music is up with lots of laughter.  good place to get your grooming on.
my hair was very dry and rough. the lady started off with complaining about my hair. she cut it in like 2-3 minutes. i ask her  to re touch up the sides and she gives me a look like shes doing it for free so im not supposed to ask twice or something. and she does it in a hurry. prices are reasonable but not their attitudes. bad experience uh oh
"the way they cut was pitiable with absolutely no perfection in handling and working with the scissors. i could say that either she never got any formal training in hair cutting or she was totally ignorant. she kept blabbering away with the other stylist who was cutting my boyfriend's hair. his haircut also turned out quite messy with jagged lines and uneven lengths. she was also a little rude and stared at him when he asked her to do make some changes, seemed like she had to run off somewhere. we have got better haircuts for the same price in other salons."
"this review is for matthew keys, not for great clips!it's been a while since i last visited dallas and every time i need my hair done, not just done, but correctly, i always hit up matthew.  he is by far the best that i have ever been to and he knows what the hell he is doing.  he's a rock star, and a god with his profession.  i've been to quite a few hairstylist/ barbers in dallas and i have t found any i like, until matthew came along.  not only is he a great person to do your hair, he will also exceed your expectations.  you'd be a fool to not go to matthew!"
my boyfriend and i went into this great clips on a sunday afternoon after being referred to matthew keys from numerous 5 star reviews at his old salon. we were not disappointed! matthew cut my boyfriends hair exactly how we asked and was so nice and quick! my boyfriend looks for things to be cheap and efficient and this was above and beyond those expectations. we will definitely be back in here to see matthew for future hair needs. you can text him directly to see when he's working- but it sounds like he's in there ~6 days a week. +1 (214) 394-8678
super busy locale but you can check in online for your appointment!
matthew keys is so awesome. my favorite barber and i have yet to get a less than superb haircut!
"absolute disappointment. i took my 13 year old son in and the 'stylist' did about half of what i specifically asked her to do.  not that it was anything special, just clean up and shorten a typically teenage mop of hair.then at the end she just laughed, thinking somehow my comments of specific deficiencies were funny.obviously zero tip and won't be returning..."
"i'm new to town, and when looking for a new place to get my hair cut, this great clips had the best rating in the area. i checked it out, and it's obvious why.i checked in online, so didn't have to wait very long when i arrived. that's an important step to take though, because this place is busy!i told my stylist what i was looking for and she went above and beyond. she was kind, checked in with me as we were going along to make sure that it was to my liking. she was so professional, fun, and overall great at her job.i'm really pleased with my haircut here and would strongly recommend it. i will absolutely be back. also, if you live in the area, watch your mail because i got a coupon for a $6.99 haircut. great price and great haircut!"
got a haircut here about 3 weeks ago. staff was friendly and efficient. will return when i am on this side of town
"wish i could give negative stars or even 0!this place has gone down hill in the past 6 months to year. different stylists at every visit. went in today to only have the absolute worse cut ever in my life. she never spoke, never confirmed what the ticket said, never asked me anything. i felt like a couple of times i thought my ears were going to get cut off. feel certain this was one of her first cuts and had no idea what to do. now i need to find a new place for hair cuts. do not go to this great clips ever. i will report to their hq. today the owner of the location contacted me to apologize and discuss my experience. he assured this issue with the stylist has been resolved. very nice for the owner to reach out to me. i will return."
"took my daughter there for an updo, never had been there before. tatiana did an excellent job with my daughter's hair and it stayed all night!! she made my daughter feel right at home by interacting with her throughout the process. she is such an awesome person! also reasonably priced! if you are looking for a great stylist, ask for tatiana!"
"first off, go see claudia, she's awesome! i have very tricky hair, i.e. cowlicks & wavy, she nailed it! i showed her a picture of the style i was looking to achieve she offered input and the final look sparked compliments since. great personality and talent, what more could you ask for?now besides great stylists, as the other girl working was very friendly and stylish as well, the store is well kept. smells nice, very clean, as well as the tools are well cleaned & maintained. last but certainly not least in today's economy, the price was very reasonable. i will certainly be back and if you're in the area and need a cut this should be your first stop... and ask if claudia is available lol."
"we came here because our normal place, sports clips, raised their prices.  here, they are having a back to school special for kids- $7.99 haircut.  the cut was decent, not fantastic but not horrible, but the woman was a tough nut to crack.  my little guy is a total charmer but this lady didn't want to smile or talk to him.  it was odd.  but his hair looks a bit more clean cut for preschool tomorrow."
"if your normal stylist isn't there, be prepared to get skipped. got there, checked in, waited a few mins (nobody else there, mind you) some other person walks in gets checked in and the lady calls him over. the stylist tried to explain that he was there earlier and left. he was removed from the check in log, so in theory, he lost his place in line, right?? nope, she puts him back on the list and calls him first and decides to skip me. wow, way to be fair! thanks for making me feel like a wanted customer!! bye!"
"only went to check it out because of $6 haircut coupon.  was maybe worth $0.25. don't remember her name but lady in the front was less than friendly , couldn't make any type of conversation during mediocre haircut. 2 stars because it does has reasonable prices. save your $ and get pizza next door :)"
"i am not very particular on who cuts my hair as long as they do a good job.  when you get your hair cut here the first time they record it in the computer and print out that request the next time you show up.  they always confirm that is still how i want my hair cut.  the employees have always been polite, some are more talkative than others and most importantly the haircut has always been consistently good.  the whole family goes here and none of us have ever had an issue.  there is also a military discount as long as you bring some sort of id."
tatiana did a fabulous cut and style for me!!  came in on my lunch hour using online check in and she listened to what i needed and made it happen.  added plus was that she has a great personality and i really enjoyed getting to know her.  price is very affordable too!
"tatiana is the best stylist ever. i usually just let anyone cut my hair but not anymore. 6 weeks ago she cut my hair in a cute short style and even when it grew out i was getting complements. i love great clips and i love my stylist, she is very talented and super friendly!!!!!"
meghan did such an awesome job cutting my girls hair that i came back the next night to have her cut mine! we all love our new haircuts.
"been going to this place for over a year now. i am always pleased with the service and great attitudes from the ladies. tatiana and mystery specifically, are always on top of things. they always do a great job, and are great folks as well!"
i have brought my son here since he was 3. michelle always does an amazing job and she's fast!
"i have been here two times in the last couple weeks taking my kids for haircuts. my little boy was given a stylish haircut that i am very pleased with. i figured after having a good experience and a coupon from my receipt that i'd go again for my little girl.i went in and the worker started asking a few questions about what i wanted to do for my little girls hair. i told her and she kept telling me, "" no you don't want to do that."" she kept repeating that even after i'd ask why not. she kept saying we'll give her a trim which i had already mentioned i wanted her hair cut and even. this was her first haircut. well the haircut turned out horribly. she then goes to blame it on my girl for ""moving"" well, first off, she's two and she wasn't moving that much because i had her on my lap and keeping her pretty still. she chopped her bangs so high and barely touched the part i actually wanted her to cut. i was not a fan of the stylist and i could tell it was not going to end well, she was older and seemed to not be up to date on the styles. let's just say i'll return but be more selective on who gets to cut my kids hair."
"i really like this place because it's so conveniently located.  it is probably a 5 minuted drive down the street from me.  the online check-in app is great... and really cuts the wait time in half, if not more.  i've been coming to this location for about 2 years now, and come in for a cut maybe  every 2 1/2 to 3 weeks.  they def. make you feel at home because they greet you right when you walk in the doors.  they def. know me by now and it's easy to feel comfortable.  i do have my go-to stylist.  they are all very personable and strike up pretty interesting conversations.  only a couple times i have felt a little unimpressed/unsatisfied with the work done.  on one occasion they gave me a taper, but totally forgot to do the other side!  i didn't bring it up at that moment because i did not notice it right away. thankfully i knew how to fix the situation myself with my own clippers back at home.  on one of my more recent visits, the stylist adamantly thought she knew what i should do with my hair, even though it was not what i was asking for.  i ultimately got my way and she cut it how i wanted it but it was just shocking that she kept trying to cut it her way.   with that being said, i now ask for particular stylist to cut my hair. that easily remedies those situations from happening in the future.  i'm due for a cut at the end of this week and let's see how it goes."
very choppy. layers weren't blended and they stick out i have to wear a ponytail until my hair grows out
my teen son got his haircut here. he's very picky and really liked the cut. we will definitely be back!
"horrible.  had a bad experience the first time and returned (shouldn't have) hoping it will be better.  majority of the workers are rude and are not genuine on their ""welcome to great clips"" or their thank u s.  i will definitely not be returning nor my husband."
"hadn't been there in years (since the stylist i liked left), decided to go back and try my luck with it being under new management. my hair was short but wasn't quite how i hoped for (having it cut about a 2 wks prior to this visit). the wait wasn't  long at all, i was actually #8 on the list so about 10 min later i'm in the chair. michelle listened to what i wanted, then did exactly what i hoped the outcome would be..i was so happy (finally). the other stylists there all seem friendly & i enjoyed chatting with them. the establishment is very well kept & clean & they now have an app that you can check yourself in and cut the wait time. as long as michelle will be there i'll definitely be back..thank you michelle"
"this was my first time at this particular great clips. i walked in on a tuesday afternoon around 4 , the wait was about 15 minutes.  i showed the hairdresser a picture of the haircut i wanted, she wavered back and forth on what type of clippers to use.  she did not seem confident in her estimation of the length of hair a particular clipper would cut. after she was done, the hairline was not uniformly even and i asked her to repeat the process.  when it was all done, i found out later that the back of my hair was also not cut evenly.  for $13 haircuts, i will not return to this location.  there are places closer in houston that will cut your hair for $5 and do a better job."
great place for boys haircuts! i use their app to sign in and hold my queue before heading up to the salon. really makes it efficient to take care of their hair between obligations.their hours are convenient  and promotions are a great deal. all with a great haircut by a friendly barber!
"very good salon. i can walk in here and get the perfect haircut for a reasonable price. this is a great place if you want to get your hair styled for not that much money. the stylists are helpful, and they listen. remember to check in online to avoid wait times!"
"i have the worst luck with hair stylists... in that when i find a good one, they leave the salon/move away/quit doing hair within the year. so i'm constantly on the prowl for a good stylist that isn't going to break the bank when i need a cut! i was in desperate need of a hair cut, and hadn't had the time to find a new 'permanent' stylist, so in a desperate attempt to look decent before heading back to work after having a baby, i took myself to the oak forest great clips one night for a quick cut. they do offer online check in, which also displays the current wait time for a stylist. there being no wait (and only about 5 minutes down the road), i opted to not check in online and headed straight over. there not being a wait actually meant that i had to wait for the stylists to finish the customers they had, then clean up, and then it was my turn in the chair. this was approximately 12 minutes after arriving at the shop, which was 630pm one night (30 mins before closing). i'm not sure if there are options for hair cuts, but i wasn't asked anything when checking in (wash and style, just a cut, etc) but i wanted a wash, cut, and style at the end, which isn't what i got. i got a dry cut and left with wet hair- ugh! i hate that, because i couldn't tell how the layers looked. it's stressful enough getting a hair cut by someone new, but when you can't even check the quality of the work until you get home is agonizing. the stylist was also not friendly at all, she kept talking with her coworkers the whole time i was being served. i'm not usually one to chat, but i felt like an intruder in her fun chat time circle, which made me more uncomfortable. being a nervous wreck from the experience and the new stylist, you might be wondering 'why 3 stars then?' the cut turned out to be ok, i wasn't in tears when i got home and dried it out. was it amazing, the best hair cut i've had in years? no. would i recommend coming here? again, probably not... unless you don't care much how the cut turns out and want something basic done. i may not be coming back, but i did get my hair trimmed up and looking much less crazy, and bought myself a few more months to find a permanent stylist!"
check ins mean absolutely nothing here ! i checked in thirty minutes prior and still have to wait while they let others cut in front. very unorganized and didn't even know we were here before or were here to check in.
i need to know where carla went to. she was the best hair stylist there. somebody please let me know some thing. thank you!
"i cant believe that carlita is not anymore with you guys, she was the best stylist ever and she was the only reason that i drive 10 miles to this great clips ,"
i have never gone to get a haircut and had the stylist be so rude as to skip me to get the woman behind me in line because she had requested her. i usually get my hair cut here but this is the worst service i have ever seen. the other stylist even said he is next and she said no she was waiting.i told her to take me off the list i'll get my hair cut else where.
"you can't beat this $13 haircut. my ""do"" is nothing too special, so i trust the great clips staff to trim it up just the way i want it, and even to shape my side bangs. the staff is very friendly. i've had cuts by three of them, two gals and a guy. they're down to earth and i always have a great conversation. this is my ""go-to"" to get rid of those nasty split ends."
these hair sylists have messed up my kids' hair twice! i don't know why i keep coming back.
"loud, rude employees who should be ashamed of their profanity-laden language."
my haircut is easy and can't be messed up.  they do the job based on what i ask for.
been coming here for so many years.  i'm always greeted by name and get great service. love that i'm able to check in through the app for a less wait time.
"this little strip mall location was polite to accept two of us right at closing time!  my cut was done quickly and professionally- my friend said he was pleased but that his stylist was really ""new"" and didn't seem like she was comfortable in the role yet."
"in my great clips has changed with the staff, geslle and tameka were the only people i've trusted and they left and i have fortunately found them if anyone would like to know where they are at message me."
"after coming to this location religiously for several years, it's time to search for another place to get my haircut. the last several times i have visited, the haircuts and shampoos have been sub par. additionally, there is a specific employee who will bother you continuously trying to up sell products. i say no, and she asks. ""are you sure?"" this goes on a couple of times. i finally told her she's being pushy and she replies that she's only joking. pretty tacky. same haircut person today and the photo is the back of my shirt after a shampoo. ugg. she asked if i wanted some product on my hair and i said yes, some gel. she then tries to use a gel product that's new, i tel her i use a specific brand and then she offers an even lesser priced brand. uggh. they have the brand there because i buy it from their shop and there was an open bottle at another station, but i guess she didn't want to spend the extra .15 of product. :(also, two of the stylists were speaking badly about the owner or manager. don't know if they realized i could hear them, but another reason not to return to great clips. the location has taken a noticeable turn for the worse in ambience and quality. recommend sports clips right across the street. they have much better reviews and stylists."
"this place is not the same without tomeka. i've been getting my haircut at this location for 2 years now and i've been able to trust almost the entire staff (dulce, tomeka, and kristen are great) when i drop in for random visits. they must have replaced most of the staff after tomeka's exit because i don't recognize any of the new stylists, and no offense, they aren't nearly as good. so not only are the stylists not as good but now they shove product marketing down your throat the entire visit. very sad day.  you can tell it's new management/ownership... and it's just not good."
"since tomeka left the energy in the salon has shifted, and not really for the better. a lot of gossiping across to each other (sometimes about other customers), and just overall downgrade in customer service with the newer staff. i only go for dulce now. if she's not there, i'm not getting a hair cut."
"on a normal basis i would give this place a good score, but today, only a few flipping days before christmas we made a big mistake by coming to the wrong person! my 15 year old has wonderful hair.  all he wanted was a trim. we told her that!  terrible hair cutter.  just chop chop chop away.  i guess i should have babysat her while she was chopping away. this is no trim. and then. they were like ""well don't pay"".  what?! it is not about not paying!!!!  it is about doing what the customer wants. we specifically told her that he likes it long.  to leave it over the ears...long in the back. look at these pictures. go practice on someone else.  not my son. lady needs more training before she gets paid again to cut hair.  listen to the customer.  not every man wants short hair. and then they blamed my 15 year old for not speaking up?! jerks. manager and owner need to contact me!"
"i just had an amazing hair cut experience with tameka. she was very professional and quick but showed great attention to detail. i felt that she really cared about how my haircut turned out. she mentioned that she wanted my hair to look great because she is ""putting her name on it.""this kind of accountability and pride in work is hard to find these days especially with a haircut under $20.thank you tameka and i will request you from now on."
i've been getting my haircut at great clips for a little over a year since i arrive to houston.the stylist's have always done a good job for me. i've had my hair done by other salon's in the surrounding area and this particular great clips seems to have their act together. the management and staff is receptive paying close attention to my hairstyle even if i don't know what i want to be done with it. and if i don't they provide me with good examples and deliver satisfying results.i've had my hair styled from everyone on the staff. there isn't anyone here that doesn't know what they're doing. i'm immensely pleased and as long as i'm in houston i will continue giving them my business. and the price is nice always falling under $10. can't beat that unless you're deployed. :)
"i've been to many different locations of great clips and this one remains my favorite. even though i have to drive 1/2 hour, i prefer it to the three locations near me. i've had both crystal and jess cut my hair and i'm very happy both times."
"great haircut for a great price! i am a female with long hair and could not believe it was just $13. dulce cut my hair and she did a magnificent job! i would highly recommend great clips to anyone who wants to save money and get a great, fast haircut. i was in and out in less than 20 minutes!"
"the wait time here is not good they need more help. the hair cuts are decent, if you need a quick cut and nothing special this would be a great place for just that."
"how does a chain haircut store get 5 stars?  let me drop some knowledge on you.i pulled into the parking lot and got the spot closest to the door.  when i walked in i was promptly greeted, and did not even have to sit down in the waiting area.  i was led straight to a chair.  this was at 5pm on a week day; when i believe it should be turbo busy.  upon being seated my stylist talked with me about my haircut.  it was not the usual formality, she really discussed how she was going to cut my hair, and what she was trying to achieve.  i appreciated the focus, and i did not feel like a part of an assembly line.  she cut my hair exactly like she said, and i was very pleased with the results.so i got a great haircut with no wait.  that's good.  now what made it five stars?  the price.  it was $6.99!  i haven't had a haircut that cheap since i was a kid and my mom would drop me at the navy base to get my ""regular boy haircut.""  i wonder if there was an ""irregular boy haircut?""  i will probably never know.  either way, i will be going back!"
dulce is the best by far! she always listens to what i want and delivers! always in and out. she is super sweet and i  hope she stays for a while! love my hair!
i stopped by before jumping a flight to dallas for a big sales meeting with a customer the following day. one of the worst hair cuts i've ever gotten. i told the lady to taper the back & use razor #2.5 to fade halfway up then blend it. this b**** use #1 & scalped me. look at the picture...it's uneven & looks like i'm losing hair. i was furious & refused to pay! i walked out & told her it was the worst hair cut i've ever gotten. a customer in the chair behind me looked at me & said - wow that is bad!
"what ever you do, criticizing an employee named jazelle will get you on her bad side. she does not take criticism well and i won't be going back for sure after having her cut my hair for the past couple of years."
"ahh, it's ok.it will grow up again. why?? could be my fault communicating what i wanted.very polite and cheerful girls otherwise!!"
"great experience! checked in online after getting my car washed and upon arrival, i waited less than 5 minutes.i will definitely be coming back to this location.service was great and stylists were friendly and complimentary of my haircut ;)yu"
"they lost a customer for sure. i have been going here for the 2 years i've lived in town. at first, things were ok, but then they start adding notes on my haircut. they never listened to the words i was saying, ""cut my hair short!"" all they did was follow the notes, that were wrong.i've had three of the worst haircuts back to back to back. i tried, but this is ridiculous. listen to your customer, if i say 2 on the side, don't give me a 3-4 crap fade. if i say cut it as short as your finger lengths will go, do that!i cut my own hair this morning fixing this place. don't go here. not worth it!"
"since there really isn't much to tell, this will be quite a short review. haircuts for men are almost $20 and combined with subpar customer service and performance this wouldn't be the first place i send a friend."
called at 8:52pm asking if i could get a quick hair wash and they said they'd take me if i got there before 9. i got there in time and was only $5. lucky they took me and price so reasonable.
do not allow charlotee i believe is her name ever cut your hair. i specifically said i have sensitive skin and scalp please use scissors she refused and only would use clippers. i politely asked if she did not know how to cut the style i've been getting for years at great clips is in my notes with no issues and she only responded it's the same. she severely screwed up my hair. worst hairstylist and customer service ever.
"extremely fast and high quality haircuts and very cheap. their online system makes it easy to see how long the wait is and get your name on the list from home, avoiding wasted time. they also keep your haircut preferences stored in their system making it more consistent. highly recommend getting your haircut with lydia, kim or margerita. i've had experiences with other barber shops where it was awkward to tell a stylist to make a change at the end but here they will ask you at the end and be very chill about anything that you ask to change (e.g. asking for a shorter cut)."
"my husband recently got a haircut at this location from michelle. he has been here multiple times in the past, and has always had a good experience. as soon as he got home i noticed how much care and detail she took on his haircut and style, even slightly trimming his facial hair to match his new style. great job, great effort."
"this location is awesome!!! the stylist are always attentive and genuine. ms. charlotte cuts my hair every week and she is always super sweet. she knows exactly how to cut my hair, but the best part is that she is always asking how i'm doing. i love this location."
"been going to this location for two years.  first stylist was excellent but relocated.  have used my current stylist, named charlotte, for about a  year.   she always does a good job. some stylists listen to you and then do what they want.  she always asks how you want your hair cut and cuts it that way. charlotte wants you to be satisfied with your hair cut and in addition, she has a great personality."
very fast service but terrible haircut. i asked for just the the ends of the top of my hair to he cut and se took of like an inch! awful haircuts
i've been to this location several times now and each time the haircuts get worse. it's safe to say i won't be going back because my hair couldn't take a worse haircut than my last one here.
love the online check in. i drive from katy to this location because of fredia. i only want her to cut my hair. i've been to other locations but keep coming here. the music can be a little louder than i like but not that bad.  i gave five stars for fredia but everyone else here would be a 3 and 1/2 to 4.
"have been coming here over a year.  your experience will vary greatly based upon who you get. as others mentioned, fredia is great. however, they seem to have high turnover because i often end up with someone i haven't seen before with varying quality. the last haircut was terrible. the young lady was sweet, but literally didn't know how to cut my hair and all i get is a buzz with 2, 3, 4. i'm questioning whether she had been through any training at all or had a license. the other lady had to come over and try to help her, but it just ended up being a mess. it's noticeably longer on one side.  i have tried other locations as well and had another bad haircut there as well so i gave this one another try. just looking for some place i can get a simple buzz with clippers, but it seems to be a challenge!"
"don't bother. first time coming here, was not even acknowledged by anyone to be checked-in but two others walk in 5 minutes later and got checked-in.they don't believe in helping everyone apparently."
best hairstylist in town! ask for tamika!  very attentive and receptive for hair needs. will give you constructive feed back! been coming to her for past year!
"sometimes you just need a simple haircut.  my default hair cutting chain has been tgf, because most of the times you know what you're going to get.  nothing too fancy, but they won't totally screw up your hair.  well unfortunately, the tgf near my house sucks! so i had to search for another simple hair salon.  good ole yelp showed me that there was this great clips not far from my house.  i called and they were open until 5 pm on a sunday.  i wish they were open a little later, but this will do.  we came at about 4 pm and they had about 8 total booths and 5 of them being filled with a stylist.  which was a pleasant surprise because even though the waiting room was full, we were able to get into a chair fairly quickly.  they keep notes in the system so that when you come back the next time you can have the same stylist and similar hair cut.  it's $14 for a basic cut which is comparable to most basic salons."
"i don't know who i had for a hair stylist this time, but i normally come here for a trim and i always get the same lady who is super sweet and nice. she always does my hair really well. this time however, i came in wanting to donate my hair and cutting it right below the shoulder. i didn't get either one. the lady cut off 8 inches of hair which left my hair below my shoulders. which isn't enough to donate. i wasn't mad i couldn't donate it, i just wanted her to keep the hair at the same length it was or trim off a little bit (maybe an inch at most) but she cut off 3 inches more of my hair! leaving me with a dora hair cut, that is not only uneven but also unbelievably short. i have picture day at school in a week and i don't know what i'm supposed to do with this mess"
they don't not know how to cut black people hair at all they messed up my friends haircut and only used one kind a clippers the whole time and cut her hair uneven
came in for a simple haircut and beard trim. my directions are always very clear. number 2 on sides and fingerlength up top .. just enough to comb backwards. my hair dresser was difficult to communicate with because she was not very good at english. she was showing me the back and turning me loose. i had to tell her it was to long and that she had forgotten my beard.she makes the top a little shorter and then does my beard with the same number 2 large clippers used on my head. she uses no smaller or more precision clippers required. as a result my beard looks unkept and lazy. i'll have to redo it myself. she was clearly uncomfortable as if she had never done it. i'm not one to start trouble so i paid my bill. tipped and left. i'm not sure she would even have understood my directions to fix it. not sure what i paid for as i'm going to have to do it properly myself. this is the second great clips i've been to that did a rushed sloppy job on my beard.maybe they should just stop offering them?the get it right about 60% of the time and it's 1/2 the price of a haircut. gonna have to find somewhere else.
"i was done with people that either don't speak english and/or only know one hairstyle for men.this place was good for me until my last 2 haircuts. yesterday was terrible as i had let my hair grow out for a ""pompadour"" style only to be mowed down by yet another hair stylist from their never ending turnaround.it will grow back and blah blah blah but what really pisses me off is having to pay $14 plus tip for a -5 dollar haircut-"
"these were the nicest and most professional staff i've experienced since living in houston. i went to sports clips and had the worst haircut of my life. i immediately drove to great clips to explain what happened and multiple stylists gathered around to help fix my hair cut. they truly cared about providing me with a satisfying experience. my hair looked 100xs better when they were done. i will never go anywhere else in houston. if you need a hair cut and want to have a great experience while you get one, go to great clips at myerland."
"so i've had rather inconsistent experiences with this place before, which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to running a business, but this last experience was just inexcusable and led me to vow to never stray from my usual barber no matter how inconvenient his scheduling.this place has done for me in a pinch in the past but the experience of the barbers/stylists (which they don't seem to hold onto) can vary widely.  in my last experience i decided to use great clips app to check in.  50 minutes and the timer starts counting down.  okay, so i can chill at home and check in a few minutes before my supposed appointment (after all, it is a timer counting down to zero - a survey of my friends seems to make this a reasonable assumption).  arrive ten minutes ahead of time according to the counter and take a seat.  after waiting 15 minutes and noticing people walking in and going ahead of me i get suspicious.  look at the app...seems it reset to 33 minutes.really?  this is doctor scheduling.  they overschedule and plan for people to be late/cancel and end up with a waiting room of people sitting around for hours.  i hate it when my doctor does it and i hate it when a business does it.  my usual barber knows what an appointment means and will have you seated within seconds walking into the door.after waiting another 15 minutes i finally get called up.  i sit down and make my request (zero around, clippers up top to style).  it's not the easiest haircut to make look good, but i've consistently tipped well to make up for this.  what do i get?  ""do you mind waiting for another girl?  i don't know how to do zeros.""she wasn't rude.  she was perfectly polite and reasonable.  but, from my understanding, i just walked into a haircut place and sat down for half an hour only to be told ""i don't know how to cut fucking hair!!!!""  if i sat down at a shoe repair place and got this response that would be reasonable.  if you asked me i think it'd be reasonable since i didn't go to fucking school for this career.  but why the hell are you here with clippers and a pair of scissors if you don't know how to fucking use them!?  even if her response was to offer to attempt it but tell me she has never done it before, i would have been fine.  my not having a haircut at that moment would be on me.  but this was just fucking ridiculous.skip it.  go to matt over at bellaire's original barber shop.  he may cut old conservative white dudes for a living but he won't even flinch if you request a hitler youth cut - and he'll do it well."
"haircut days are the best. i love this place. as a low-maintenance kind of girl, i feel totally comfortable and happy coming here. though the clientele is majority male, they do ladies hair just perfectly. i was shocked to be able to walk right in on a saturday at noon, and be immediately placed in a chair. ana did a perfect job, just what i wanted, was kind and conversational but didn't waste time either. great place for a basic trim, undercut, short cut, or more complex stuff. (my understanding is the only thing they do not do is color.) kudos, beechnut location!"
"i can't stand this place. been here several times hoping to think it would get better but apart from a few good experiences, they've all been horrible. the latest experience (12/31/17) was unsurprisingly miserable. the woman who cut my hair interacted with me like a robot and refused to understand how to communicate. i asked her for her thoughts and she goes, ""it's however you want it"". i could go on but i don't really care to and will never be back at this miserable place again."
"i usually use thuy, & she no longer works here and i am so sorry that i asked for a bob with a very long, angled front because i now have a bowl haircut and i have no idea what i am going to do with my hair tomorrow.  i am in tears & my hair looks really crappy.  why didn't i just ask for a trim?  if the lady had not spent all her time worrying that because i had curly hair, i wouldn't like the cut, she would have actually heard me say really long asymetrical front instead of bowl, which i am 100% certain i did *not* say."
online checkin gets you pushed to the front of the line and they have a mobile app to make it even easier!
"i can't comment much because i only use this place about once a year when i am visiting my old home town.  bottom line...plenty of stylists who can do plenty of options (i am a guy after all...how many ""options"" are there really???).  i do make life difficult with the way my hair can be and i have not had any problems from this place (though i have had issues with other places).  they also offer your typical haircare products and the staff is very friendly.there is a reason i always go back to them when i am home and i recommend them if you are in the area."
great clips great place!! amiling faces....i luv this place!
"while driving i tried to find a saloon, the gps pointed out that there is one in the next exit. with doubts i took the exit. it is a neat saloon without any big expenses. i walked out happy and satisfied. i never expected and now this is my to go place for haircut."
"for the price, this is as good as it gets. i always walk out of here symmetrical and well taken care of. their employees seem better trained."
i have been to other great clips and was surprised that they couldn't find me in their system. the other great clips did a great job cutting my brothers and my hair but this location is definitely not worth it. it is like they have not style hair before or be able to visualize how the customer will look if they took too much off on the side or on top. i will not be coming to this location again in the future.
"i am giving this great clips only one star due to the fact that their hairstylist (blue hair) moves at the pace of a dying sloth. i arrived and there was two people in front of me. for your information these two men were getting buzz cuts. i'm not a hair stylist, but i know that it should not take her an hour to complete two buzz cuts. having to wait that long is insane. they also take priority over online check ins even if you have been waiting for over an hour. i would save your time and go to sports clips one block over."
"i've taken my son there several times and the staff had been very nice, and cut my sons hair to our liking. today, we were there for about 15 minutes, someone walked in and was seen before us because he checked in online...which is a bad practice. the perception, because the woman didn't explain the procedure, was that because we are of another race (yeah i know, but just a perception) that those who may be perceived privileged got head of line. so, waited and asked the woman who cut my sons hair what was the practice, and she said she thought walk ins get seen first and checkins thereafter. check in just means that you have confirmed your appointment??? lastly, the quality of the hair cut was disappointing. positives, place was clean and tidy. dr. p"
we walks in to get the hubby a quick hair cut and got right in.  elizabeth did his cut and she did a great job! not too short and she did a scissor cut instead of with the clips.. looks wonderful and all for $14! who can beat that??
"worst haircut of my life, and i'm 57 years old so i've had a lot of poorly done haircuts but nothing like this disaster. now i have total anxiety about ever letting anyone ever touch my hair again."
"my regular hair stylist moved out of town, and i just haven't found a new one yet. however, my hair didn't get the memo that it needed to stop growing and splitting its ends, so in a last-ditch effort i came in to great clips for a trim. i have mixed feelings about this place, but haven't decided if i would go back. to make this review short and sweet, here are the pros and cons: pros:-open late and on the weekends-takes walk-ins-check in online and they'll be waiting for you when you arrive-cheap cheap cheap! $13 for my haircutcons:-i only got a haircut. no shampoo, no styling. it wasn't offered, but i would have taken a shampoo had it been offered. - the lady asked if i wanted my hair blow dried, and i said yes. however, she only blew my hair for about 2 minutes and i left with damp and unstyled hair. -my hair is crooked. since she didn't dry the style, i didn't notice until the next day when i straightened my hair, but the layers are choppy and there are random long strands hanging around my face. would have liked her to go into the layers and make them fall nicer. not like cake layers.i'm not at all pleased with the way my layers look, and she was only supposed to take off 1/2 an inch to trim up the bottom. i didn't imagine it would turn out crooked! i'm not sure if it was just this stylist or i'd they're all like this, but i would say use caution when coming here, and make sure to have them fully dry and straighten your hair to check the layers before you leave."
"terrible.  worst hair cut of my life.  stay away.  rude. asian women chopped off all my hair, talked about her african american co worker being robbed at gun point, and said homophobic statements such as: ""straight men don't take selfies"" and ""you look straight with short hair""....wtf????    the price is cheap -- and now my hair looks like i escaped from a mental hospital!!  she could not taper hair, trim edges, round the top.  no skills.  zero.  shouldn't even be allowed sharp objects.  she's a dangerous to society with scissors!this woman smelled bad and kept talking about how she dresses up as marline monroe and gets sexy for halloween.  so inappropriate. i will never go back -- and i hope you stay far far away from this business!!!"
"this review is for the vietnamese lady, i think her name is kim. don't get cut by her. you will regret it. everyone is an okay hairdresser but she ruined my hair by using thinning scissors without telling me on my curly hair and now you can see big patches of scalp on random places. its been 2 months since then and my hair is still bad. seriously man, i hate this woman."
"i took my 9 year old nephew jordan to great clips yesterday after his dental appointment. the barber named kenny cut him behind both ears. kenny was dishonest, unapologetic, and uncaring. he tried to hide the fact that he cut him then he proceeded to say, ""go ahead, report me, nothing can be done, these things happen."" i just know that in 8 years of getting haircuts jordan has never been cut. he cut him not once but twice...both ears. he blamed jordan then he blamed the clippers. took no responsibility, didn't even apologize. one ear has the skin shaved off and took a long time to stop bleeding. i sent photos with an email to the corporate office. the owner just called and said that kenny was ""talked to"" and is going to go through customer service training. i hope it helps his future customers because we will never go back."
trust the one star reviews.  went to get a shampoo and blow dry.  she charged me for the time she spent and not the service!  what!?  and that is why it took forever for her to dry my hair.
"i am new to houston and have been cutting my hair due to how expensive hair cuts are in this city. i decided to take a chance on great clips as it'd been fine in indiana when i was in a budget.today, i went to gc and was very displeased. first, i was greeted, barely, by an older gentleman. he ended up being the one to cut my hair...in 15 mins flat! isn't look twice, didn't wash it (even though it was very greasy), didn't ask how i parted my hair, nothing. he didn't even brush my hair all the way and was like ""done"". i thought maybe i was just going to need to brush it out and fix it a bit(no big for a $14 hair cut). when i got to my car, it was disheveled, the side swept bangs were not well cut and were blunted.i went back in and had to hold the pieces i wanted fixed, every time, how i wanted them to be cut and he still did not cut there! what?!left with greasy hair, funked up bangs, and the understanding of what women mean when they talk about the feeling of helplessness you get with a funked up cut. not something i want to feel again. that was a disgrace! i have no education in styling and do better cutting mine and my husband's hair than that man...who didn't even apologize and didn't seem surprised..."
"i normally go to the great clips location in oak forest but went here because i happened to be in the area. i asked the stylist for an 8 on top and 4 on the sides and back. unfortunately, the stylist disregarded my instructions and just cut it with scissors and seemed to just do what he thought was right. also, he was very aggressive with the clippers and it felt like someone was cutting into my skin. i won't be going back to this location again."
"decided to come here for my weekly cut and was really surprised. i tend to stay away from big chain places but i'm glad i stopped here. as soon as i walked in i was greeted and put on the waiting list. they offered me a magazine and a water, which i respectfully declined. i got my usual cut (high fade the sides and blend the top) and it was at its usual cleanliness. she kept a small conversion going but seemed bored lol. she was also a little rough when she would grab my head and when she was brushing the hair off my shoulders. still a great place for a good cut. will be returning soon!"
"great place!they accept walk-ins, give lollipops, and when your hair is brushed, it doesn't hurt! i will definitely come back here for future cuts. shoutout to chuck for being an awesome stylist!"
"i'm at great clips now, this is my second time visiting and i'm extremely frustrated. first time i visited i walked in and got taken care of right away and received great service, before leaving the stylist that helped me recommended i do an online reservation next time to avoid a wait. so now i'm here my second time, made my online reservation, waited the 40 min at home and then drove over. when i arrive i find out i still have to wait for two more people -_-.. what's the point of the online check in if customers still have to wait. disappointed"
"we love andrea!  i have been to others here but no one compares to andrea. she knows how to cut a toddler boy's hair and it's only $11.  can't beat her, here!"
"let me preface by saying that my rating is based on the stylist, specifically, and not on great clips. i've taken bradley to many places, but andrea has been our go-to when he needs a fresh fade. she listens and then takes her time to make sure we're  satisfied. i've used other people here, and it's been a disaster. i've never used them for my hair, nor has hubby, but andrea does an excellent job on bradley's hair."
"shocked at the low reviews here. i get a great haircut every time, never wait in a line to get it, and you can't argue with the price. they even have a few dedicated parking places. james is new, he just started cutting here today, and this is the best haircut i've had in years."
"checked in online and arrived to be next in line and they took someone that just walked in, never coming back."
"i was surprised by this location's level of service and quality of haircut for their prices ($13 for haircut, $5 for shampoo). after a few nightmare experiences at common haircut places like great clips or supercuts, i started getting haircuts at pricier salons.my first haircut here was back last year with janel, who was very attentive, careful, and thoughtful with my haircut (asking me whether the length, layers, etc.) were okay, which made me feel a lot better about how the haircut turned out.this week, i went back in and wasn't able to see janel since she was already with another customer, but latasha was just as awesome and my haircut looks great!i'm usually not too good at getting regular haircuts every 3 months or so (because of my past bad experiences), but now that i know i have two hairstylists i can trust, i'll definitely be coming here regularly!two quick recommendations: if you can check in online before you arrive, it should help you be seen quicker since they do not take appointments. they serve customers based on order of check-in (either in-person when you arrive or online).coming during off-peak hours is also a good idea too because this particular parking lot rarely has enough spaces with all the other businesses during busy times (e.g. 12 noon-5 pm on weekends)."
"so this is the place that i take my son bradley to get his haircut. he's only five so i can't justify paying for him at the place that i go to. i have tried a number of places and really didn't like them enough to keep coming back. i think the only reason we tried this place was because they sent us a coupon in the mail and it was down the street from my house. the first time i went, i had aundrea and i thought she did a good job. since she did a good job, i decided to bring him back but she wasn't working that day. i went ahead and let whoever was working cut his hair and they were horrible. after coming home and being real disappointed with the outcome i brought him back a day or 2 later for aundrea to fix it. luckily she was able to fix it. i'm giving them a 3 star review only because they won't let you put 3.5. i wouldn't really rate it a 4 but i would definitely give aundrea a 4 star but based on the business itself, i would have to say it's a 3.5 for me."
"yep you already know i'm yelpn'. i come to this salon every time i get a drastic hair cut. it doesn't happen often but when i do i go here because of what i thought was great customer service for such a good price. unfortunately that was not the case today. came in to get bangs done for the first time in 22 years, so kind of a special occasion. walked in no hello, then as i watch this customer thank his hirdresser for the great job she said nothing. he continued to thank her but nothing, not even eye contact. already put off, and if i'm put off by some hairdresser my ass ain't getting no hair cut. so funny stuff right here, she asks my name. i say brittany, she says, last name or first?? um...lol... my first, don't know many brittany's as a last name, look story short this ginger i think, april or something like that was horrible, just mad at life and wondering why she was cutting hair. the other hairdresser was smart to tell her to stop. poor man next to me was going to get his hair done by her, i told him good luck. $13 is $13. i'm not wasting my time or money on a shitty hairdresser. and one more thing, as someone who is in the restaurant industry constantly dealing with customers i know that if you want a repeat customer, you do everything you can to give that customer a great experience from beginning to end. some people have it and some don't."
"mixed feelings. i come here regularly because it's cheap and i just get a trim, no fancy styling. but when i've been sitting and waiting for half an hour before someone even comes to put my name on the list, and people keep walking in and getting helped immediately because they checked in online, you can imagine why i'd be a little frustrated. i'd be first in line if they'd acknowledge customers when they come in the door."
"i walked in and was seen in 5 minutes. i didn't check in online because i went on a whim. james was great! i guess i expected mediocre, but i received an excellent cut, style, and service over all. i usually go to a higher price salon, but i am just as happy with my cut and style from james. he is a gem!"
"very ridiculous when i am waiting for 15 mins and two people come in who ""checked in online"" get to be served before me. if the only requirement is to say ""yes"" to ""did you check in online"", then i'm going to say yes next time. i don't care if you checked in online, if i have been waiting for 15 mins, you should serve me first. common customer service."
"it's cheap and it's in the neighborhood, and for boys that's half the battle. this location is new (and they sweep your hair into a vacuum thing in the wall, how spiffy!) so i'm going to guess the slow service and computer issues are a new location issue. i still prefer sportsclips over at taylor/sawyer for my kiddo, but there's another option in the neighborhood now for a kid haircut."
"a very clean location. both stylist had a very nice, practical hairstyle that looked good on them. they both were working like busy bees since during lunch time they had a semi-rush. for some odd reason some   customer's walked in and kept on asking for a lady natasha whom i found out is the manager. i don't know her but i think she needs more practice in scheduling so she will not schedule only two stylist during lunch time. i felt bad for those two hardworking ladies."
"came here mainly because i'm lazy and its close/cheap. but i soon learned you get what you paid for. i've gotten 4 haircuts here and only 1 of them was what i would consider a ""good cut"". the rest were terrible. honestly, i almost told the woman to just buzz it all off cause she screwed up so bad. uneven blends and just overall bad. i was embarrassed after getting it cut and 3 weeks later it still looks bad. i will definitely go somewhere better next time and pay a little extra. trust me, don't go here unless you want to look like a doofus. luckily i already have a girlfriend and she's understanding. if not, i'd be more angry cause it'd limit my ability to pick up girls. avoid this place."
came here just to get my bangs cut a and fixed. they came out terribly. now i have to go to a wedding looking like an idiot. you expect people to know how to do their job correctly.
"went in to see adrianna not too long before closing hours towards the end of the month this past november.  i almost never leave reviews on yelp but i wanted to sign in and specifically post this as she gave me a fantastic haircut and we enjoyed some wonderful conversation.  she was a pretty big football fan and had to school me a bit on what was happening in the league!anyhow, i travel very frequently for work so i often have to get haircuts on the run in various cities around the country.  it was refreshing and honestly unexpected to have such tremendous service and quality from adrianna at this great clips location.  please do not hesitate to visit this location and get a cut from adrianna!!  a++++ service!"
"i have been to great clips before and had excellent experiences. i am trying to save money so i came in today because it's cheap. i showed the lady a picture of what i wanted and she did nothing like it. i wanted a bob about an inch above my shoulder. i showed her the picture, it's an easy cut. by the time she started cutting the front it was too late. what she gave me was a very short bob about an inch above my jaw line. it's the worst haircut i've ever had. i don't want to go anywhere or see anyone. i went in wanting a cute trendy haircut for summer and i came out looking like an overweight teenage boy from the 90s. there is nothing i can do to save it or make it look better. if i didn't want to pay for another haircut, i would just go and turn it into a pixie, at least then it would look a little better."
"absolutely terrible, she couldn't even manage to cut the hairs around my ears. there's long hairs scattered on the sides of my head. one side is longer then the other. my fault for going to such a cheap place. you get what you pay for."
i've had monique do my hair here many times in the past and it's always been great.
"before coming to this location, i used to go to fantastic sam's on 1960 and eldridge but then my favorite hairstylist left and so did my favorite hairstyle. now i have had a whole bunch of experiences from oh my god i feel like a million bucks to oh my god wtf happened to my hair! last time i went i got a haircute (yes, i wrote haircute) from matthew. excellent customer service, super hilarious, and oh yes - great haircut! he cut my hair exactly as i told him. if my haircut was based on just this one experience then this location would have five stars but unfortunately that is not the case.one time i came here and there was a guy who i have never seen before. i gave him clear directions on how to cut my hair but unfortunately he used the clippers all the way up to the middle of my head. i looked like i was back in high school and was going for the ""i got my hair cut so that i won't have to go get it cut for the next two months"" look. fortunately though he managed to make it all even and in the end it was not a totally awful experience.over all, really friendly staff and mostly great hairstylists."
"adriana at great clips did a great job cutting my daughter jade's hair. she took her time, and was very pleasant. thank you!"
"i haven't had a problem with my hair cuts here, but i am disappointed that i received a coupon on yelp when i checked in and they wouldn't honor it. nice job great clips."
"always such a great experience here,  i love it.  everyone is nice but best of all this place is the best haircut i've ever gotten.  and not pricey at all.  i would recommend this place to everyone in a heart beat."
"don't bother coming here.  i literally just got a haircut here, and i felt compelled to write a review.this lady named evelia cut my hair.  i just asked for a trim on the back and my sideburns, and that's what she literally did.  took all but three minutes.  went up to pay, and they charged me for a full haircut.  i was flabbergasted because all i wanted was a trim, and that's what i got.  still, she stood her ground and charged me $13 [they advertise $5 for a trim]  for 3 minutes of her time.  i'm furious about it, and i will never come back here again.  they rip you off and charge you for something more than what you asked for and received.so word of advice....1) never come here again because they will charge you for more than what you receive2) if for some reason you feel really passionate about coming to this particular great clips location, don't ask for evelia to be your stylist3) people that nickel and dime you like this should never receive anyone's business"
"nice barber shop. the barbers in there were very social, entertaining and professional. i'm so used to going  to a barber shop where the barbers talk amongst themselves and i'm just a number.. the barbers actually talk to the customers and seem to enjoy what they do.the quality of work was good. i got compliments on my hair."
great price and great haircut. plus it's super-fast!
"i usually go to great clips because its a decent price and haircut. i went to this location right before christmas and got a middle 20s girl as a haircutter, her name was kerstin or kirstin. she was on her phone more than half the time, appeared to be under the influence and slurring her words. she did a horrible job on my haircut and i let her know it was not the cut i asked for and she was directly rude back to me. i will never return and great clils needs to revise their hiring requirements."
"i started going to great clips a few years ago when i lived in michigan.  since then, i've been to several great clips salons in various part of the country.  i tried gc-ashford center after moving to the houston area and have been very impressed.  the staff is very nice and they've always done a great job with my hair.  i have never had to wait more than a few minutes to get in a chair and the stylists are usually very efficient with quick haircuts.  the price is extremely reasonable."
"i made my first visit to this salon back in july.  i was greeted as soon as i walked in and didn't have to wait long to get my hair cut.  i was very happy with the service and the quality of my hair cut.  the price is right and the service can't be beat.  if you're in the area, i would stop by."
"doesn't matter who you get to cut your hair here. they all will do you right.  if you don't want to wait , make sure you check in on line before coming."
omg... the best customer service and quality on their hairstylist. everyone on the salon have the same standards but tammy (the mgr ) is my girl... #1
"my first time going, didn't know you could check in before hand but it was still a quick wait. very happy with the way andrea cut my hair."
"as others have mentioned, use their app to check in ahead of time and avoid the wait.  i checked in on a busy day where the wait was over 45 minutes, and when i arrived 45 minutes later, i was attended to within 1 minute!"
"this is my first time here, and i loved it. i haven't been able to find a good hair salon ever since i moved to the us two years ago but kathy was a joy to work with. i will definitely be a frequent customer here."
"fast, friendly, fun for kids and great stylists, especially ms kathy! thank you all for your patience and consideration with our kids!"
"i checked in on the app, is easy and fast. when i arrived the lady was waiting for me. silvia did excellent!! i definitely go back"
great place to get haircut and shampoo or conditioning treatments. our family favorite salon!
"my daughter went to get a trim - just keep same style and trim layers.   when she came home and flat ironed it - we saw how bad it was.  choppy layers that don't even make any sense, random pieces of hair sticking out.  no way to fix it right now unless she goes really short and cuts off 3 inches.    i was very surprised because my  younger daughter has gone there and always had a good haircut and the older one went once too and was happy which is why she returned.  but won't be going back again."
it's a good place to have a quick haircut. most of the staff in the store are very friendly but there are some people who have attitude but if you're lucky you'll find a good one.they have a online check-in app make sure you do that so that you don't want to waste you time sitting in the saloon.
"very friendly! great customer service and attention to detail. i go here a lot to get my hair shampooed and styled and they always spend a lot of time and care on my hair. they don't rush at all, each and every single one has been really friendly . i complaints, i am very happy with this place!"
"my whole family uses this location.  great, friendly, hard working employees. you can check in through their app to speed up the process and decrease waiting time. highly recommended!"
"my kids begged me to go somewhere else for haircuts and they'll finally get their wish. i just received horrible customer service after giving them years of business. their stylist and haircuts provided are mediocre, not a quality cut. i went there mainly for convenience and it was cheap, always goes back to the old saying, ""you get what you pay for""."
only came here because i had a coupon and just got the worst haircut ever. i echo brian z's comment that the staff only cared about getting through as many haircuts as possible. i won't be back.
got hair cut by rosa she's super sweet and knows how to cut and style.  check in online it works wonders especially since i brought my 2 year old in. i didn't have to sit but for a couple seconds. very clean professional place.
"actually, the whole reason why i remember this place is because they greet everyone with ""hi welcome to great clips!"" i get exactly the service i need for a price i'm perfectly willing to pay. if i'm quiet, the staff is totally respectful of that. idle chit-chat really helps me connect with the staff. you know what? i'm completely content with my experience every single time i come here, even if there's a little bit of a wait."
"they always do a great job for my son.  i really needed a cut today, so i went today for myself.  dora did an excellent job on my cut! love it!! will be going back! thanks dora!"
"walking in i wasn't even greeted by the lady at the front desk like i normally am at any great clips location i visit no mater what state i'm in. the lady at the front didn't even ask if i've check in online or anything. if you ask me i think she was overwhelmed with the amount of people already there and people coming in the establishment. you can tell the lady had an attitude. when she asked me what i came in for i proceeded to tell her a hair wash. she asked me how long my hair was and if i needed a style. i said no, just a hair wash and finger blow dry (which is free) she then told me that they can't dry my hair all the way without charging me an extra $30. as confused as i was, thinking that every location was the same. she said that if i wanted a round brush dry or style she wound have to charge me an extra $30. i told her i just needed a wash and finger blow dry. this lady had a bad attitude. i don't know what crawled up her butt but this is clearly not good customer service. as i met my stylist, keisha, who by the way was super nice and very friendly, she helped make a change in my mood about this particular location shift to the brighter side. keisha was wonderful. she did a great job with my long hair and her scalp massage game is on point!!! lol! while i was talking with her i found out that the lady in the front was in fact the manager. tammy is her name. i couldn't believe that such a person in her position was so rude. ugh!!! anyway, keisha did half way dry my hair and she did show concern for my shirt being a little damp which she did dry with her blow dryer. all in all i rate this place a two stars. the people who work there seem nice but the manager should have better customer service and show show a better example for her co-workers that maybe one day they would become manager... just a nicer one."
"they're always very sweet here when we come in. my hubby checks in online whenever we're on our way to the salon, so there's never a wait when we walk in. they always remember us. very polite, very friendly, and very efficient when it comes to cutting hair."
"tammy is the best stylist!  knows exactly what you want from your description. very professional,  must ask for her when you come for an awesome haircut!"
"was nervous when i saw that all the hairdressers were women, but it turns out that a barbershop down the street had recently closed down and many men were coming into this great clips instead. my hairdresser (didn't get her name) was very patient, asked lots of questions and seemed dedicated to giving me exactly what i wanted. i'll be coming back!"
"last week i took my son in for a haircut and the stylist cut it uneven, it has no shape either.  i'd rather spend 20.00 at a local barber shop than to come back to great clips."
"i went in here the other day do one of their $6.99 cuts. i wanted a trim. she cut off 3 inches. i wanted a ""v"" not a ""u"" and she did that but she didn't make sure all the ends were matched up. it was a terrible experience. i cried when i got home. everything people say about great clips was confirmed. not going back. ever"
"got a chance to stop by this great clips location during their opening weekend and i am so glad i did. i thought great clips was mostly for men, but to my surprise they offer blowouts and my stylist was incredibly experienced and skilled with women's hair. i got a style done for a wedding i attended and was so happy with the quality, speed, and care of my stylist. i'll definitely be coming back for a cut or another blowout!"
"yadira cut my hair november 24, 2017 6:30pmshe did an amazing job!!!!she shampooed and conditioned my hair so well!!!!!! it smells soooooo good!!!!!!she trimmed my hair!!! i loved her technique. she was very professional. i was in and out she did such a good job!!!!!"
"i am so done with this place. i have been coming here for over a year but no more. they have this b*llsh*t system where you ""check in"" online and it tells you the wait... 15 minutes, 40 minutes, 90 minutes, whatever. i work very nearby so i can monitor when it gets down to 0 (zero) minutes and i check in and go. every freakin' time, it's not zero minutes. it's 10, or 15, 20 minutes. so infuriating, and completely unacceptable. typical corporate franchising nonsense. and then while you're waiting employees sweep up, use the restroom, fraternize... all with people waiting there like sheep. see ya' not-so-great clips."
"stop by to see yadira, one of the best at doing fades for sure. she takes the time to check your haircut and she can style it as you like it. it seems that she has years of experience doing men's haircuts. highly recommended!!check in is easy, i usually stop by around 8:00pm or so when there's hardly any people and there's no wait. premises are clean and easy parking up front."
"i went there to get my ends cut. i told the lady to only cut the ends because i am growing my hair. she literally chopped my hair. it took me a year and a half to grow it as long as i had it and in less than 5 minutes she chopped it. i am so mad about it. unfortunately i forgot the name of this person but someone that can't listen to what you are saying when it comes to cutting your hair, should not be working as a hair dresser."
"if anyone who is inspired by bangs on pinterest, don't go here. and if so please ask them if they know what ""fringe bangs"" are, if they say no never heard of it. leave. i should of known that first red flag. i am seriously disappointed, mostly because i consider $20 a lot for a damn haircut. anything over $20 is ridiculous unless the person has inches of hair that needs to be cut and styled. i went in the other day and asked the guy if i can get fringed bangs, he didn't know what it was called and i showed him a picture on pinterest. they were light longish bangs with a gradual length on the side if you want to put your hair up. he first grabbed a few pieces of my hair (another red flag) like wtf is that? i said can you get a little more? and i was hoping he would style the sides. he didnt. he probably didn't pay attention to the length of my bangs. he sprayed alot of water all over my hair, i got a cut for a trim on the layers (he barely touched them) and left me with damp messed up hair. soon as i got home, washed and dried. i was pissed that my hair still felt super dry that i had to come back and do the layers. but i should of asked someone to fix the bangs. when i posted an ig story, i got comments saying i should of gone somewhere to pay $60 for stupid bangs!! because i got what i paid for??? $20 should not mean leaving someone with a terrible cheap ass cut. it's supposed to be a professional salon! not a training beauty school. a friend said he butchered my hair and she can't do much and to wait it out. i can't believe this guy left me out of my chair looking like that. i wish i can get my partial refund back. one star for the girl who did the extra trim. please pay attention to the stylist if they aren't focused on your hair or needs. it may just be hair but it looks ridiculous and a waste of money. i really don't understand this industry when it comes to spending a fortune for a decent cut. and the bangs was really nothing hard to do for someone in his position. age and gender has nothing to do with it either. he's hardly anywhere near what i called old, he can keep up to trends and this is not a difficult one. i'm just so upset i have to deal with this for months to it grows back!!!"
"my boyfriend went in for a hair cut and he told the lady how he wanted it and when he came out, the back of his head was uneven and cut too short..not at all how he wanted it..he says he's never going back and wish he went somewhere else. don't recommend."
"i always got my cut with kim when i have coupons in the mail.  as of october 2017 prices are 17 bucks for haircut.  coupons in mail give you 3 bucks off.  this review is for the torrance location at hawthorne and torrance blvd.  i like how the computer system already keeps my style profile in place and that i can check in online.  no more guessing games and walking out due to the barber being fully committed for the day! unlike some barbers expect to shower on your own to get rid of stuck hairs.  shampoo and wash is extra.  no such thing as razor shaves for the back unless if you pay extra.  photos were taken the day of the cut, 5 on top medium fade with 0 on side."
"got my cut today from angelica. i showed her a picture of how i wanted the cut and she went ahead and did her thing...totally different from what i  wanted.  asked her about using the scissors instead of the trimmer and she responds ""not this time"" !!! so what's the deal here??? a major disappointment and did not find her polite at all...$17 for a shitty haircut with rude behavior, never sitting in her booth again!"
"recently, great clips started giving preferential treatment to customers who give them a higher tip. these days, it's always a long wait there. so when you go there ask for a particular stylist, they will say 10 or 20 min or will say 1 or 2 people ahead. when you sit and wait, they will call someone who just showed up. if you ask them, they would say the other person checked in online, but that person's name was not there in the check-in list (as per their computer screen). if you ask them, they would say, it's the system that shows the other person was ahead. you could clearly tell this is a false claim by monitoring the way that they try to manage. finally noticed the other person paid a way higher tip than usual tips. this clearly shows if you start paying a higher tip, you could cut the line."
went for a hair cut last week. very disappointed. feels like i didn't even get a hair cut. i think the lady was too into talking with other stylist than to put focus on cutting my hair. had asked for front layers and looks like she didn't even touch the front. bangs were still long and had to get one of my family members to touch it up after going in for my hair cut. what a waste of $20. defiantly won't be returning. san pedro location is better.
"recently i decided to cut off at least 4+ inches of my hair. mobile check in is a super cool feature! i typically spend almost $150 to $200 for a haircut. both my boyfriend's haircut, and my hair cut plus conditioning treatment came out so cheap and both of us loved out haircuts. we will be coming back for sure! great service, prices and haircuts! only downfall is that their parking lot can be a bit crazy during busy times"
"went for a small trim and i actually got that. everyone there is super nice, took the time to understand what i wanted when i said 1in  she cut 1in. i forgot her name started with a y, i would recommend anyone to this specific great clips."
"i have been coming here for over three years. i am a satisfied customer! i really like how karla cut my hair; i have seen it grow fast when she handles it. she's nice, won't rush. just one reason i gave them a 4 and not 5 is because they will try to sell you products but you can find these items elsewhere and cheaper! overall, i like it here."
"worst experience ever at this place. my 11 year old son literally got the worst verbal abuse ever by the lady veronica who cut his hair. for example when my son said he felt like a robot she came back with robots sit still better. also when hair got down his shirt she blamed him for taking his arm out of the apron and when she tried to pull his shirt out to blow dry it she yanked it telling him that he needs to let go in a rude manner. i have never in my life experienced a hair dresser that rude!!!! never will i return to this location again!!!! to add on my son hasn't had a hair cut in over a year because he grew it out to donate it and right off the back she said it wasn't long enough. i have the ponytails and when i got home i measured them and they were more than long enough. i honestly think this lady just doesn't like cutting kids hair. my daughter and i were taking pictures of the process not for youtube or social media but for his journey in life and memories and she asked him ""do you get recorded a lot?"" of course he said yes. she came back with a comment saying ""well i don't!"" it's the next day and i'm still upset about this experience."
"nice place to get hair cut. i've always come here to get my haircut. it's best if you check-in through their website to get an idea how long you wait before you are next. staff is friendly. i get buzz cut which is really simple for the employee to do. depending on the employee, when they cut my sideburns it's uneven or its cut too much. i wish they can be a little more cautious or caring when cutting hair so it's symmetrical"
i have been getting my haircut from yadira for 6 years now and i follow her wherever she goes. thank you for always giving me great haircuts and for introducing me to tapers. you are very friendly and very clean.
"ive had many great haircuts at this place. they are fairly inexpensive but do a high quality job. the manager is great, they are always very friendly and they work hard."
"i've been coming to great clips for the last 6 haircuts. so 5-6 month. i guess i got the luck of the draw my first time by getting greg to cut my hair. greg does a great job and he's a nice guy as well. the shop is busy, turn over is fast enough, it's clean, staff is always friendly and the price is right.if you don't want to wait the 10-30 minutes, download there mobile app and make a same day appt! just remember to set your appt within 15-20 minutes of your planned arrival!"
"my wife and i have been coming to this great clips for about a decade.  at some point in the first year or 3, johanna made an impression on us and became our regular stylist.she always does a good job shaping our heads and her fun and friendly personality just make it that much better.to be clear, everyone at great clips is great and we have used other stylists on those rare occasions when johanna was off and we simply had to get a cut right away.  always a good experience.as my household has grown a bit in the last few years, johanna remains our regular stylist and she now also does my little girl's hair, as well as my mom-in-law's hair."
"my husband said to give this place 5 stars.  he walked in with 8 people ahead of him and he was still back to the truck within 25 minutes!  fast service, and his hair looks pretty good!he'll definitely go back here!!!!yay!"
"my daughter got her first haircut today and everything went as smoothly as i could imagine. walked in, got called in right away, got a haircut by kimberly (who was lovely), and went about our day!location has plenty of parking at no cost. will go back soon!"
"came in here a few days ago, the short lady and yes i said short, i'll explain why, who cut my hair had the nerve to make me slide down on the chair  so that she could reach the top of my head to cut my hair, rather than pressing the lever to lower the chair like what everybody else does there, to reach the top part of my hair.this lady needs extra training. since she realized that she was struggling with me she laughed at me and didn't say excuse me or anything, so unprofessional. most likely i will not be returning to this salon."
reason why i chose to use this barber shop is for convenience of closeness to home and making appointment for prompt service. i made an appointment on line and the waiting time was 59 min. i got to barber shop on my 50th min. and the one lady barber was doing hair on a woman and another lady waiting on a chair for her turn. my name was next to the lady waiting on a chair. that means that i have to wait for another 1/2 hour or more. told the lady barber that their on line appointment is not accurate and i left and went elsewhere to get a haircut.
"they did not do a good job.  i showed the lady a picture of a lob and she said she could do it.   it turned out very choppy/uneven.  if the stylist didn't know how to layer, she should have admitted it!  so disappointing.  i got what i paid for since i was desperate for a cut, so i'm not mad.  but great clips should build a better reputation for themselves by setting standards and by hiring people who don't just practice cutting hair for dolls!  now i have to go to ulta in the same plaza to have them fix it hahaha"
"really bad customer service. they've always had two particular employees with a really bad attitude, i don't know their names. i was a long time customer but i left because of the service, today i came back hoping they improved or the employees not there but they're still there with the same terrible customer service."
i've been growing out my hair and this has been the process of how it looks thanks to nisha. she's amazing. so happy my hair is getting long. it looks fabulous with the products that this location has to offer.
"wow.  this used to be a great place to get family haircuts. friendly stylists who took pride in their work and made you feel welcome. not anymore. under the leadership of temmika, this place has gone downhill.  zombie like greeting when you walk in.  they all seem annoyed to have clients.  temmika yelled at both of us during our kids haircuts.  at separate times, our kids has asked us a question so we stepped closer to answer.  temmika shouted across the salon that we couldn't stand there. the stylist could have told us, but temmika had to make a big deal in front of everyone.  it felt like the dmv.  we have 2 kids. neither stylist was pleasant to the kids.  overall, won't ever come back. there are better places to get your hair cut.  avoid temmika and her rude crew."
"got my haircut today from quinisha!    she was fantastic.  she was super thorough, talented, courteous.  i've been coming to his place for a while and they're all great, but quinisha stands out! couldn't ask for more. i will be sure to request her again!  couldn't be happier."
jus had my hair cut. quick and jus what i wanted. selena. the one.with the nice eyes did a good job
"worst hairstylist ever! this location is so close to my house it's easy and tempting to stop by . the few times i have ,i have regret it so much. every stylist in this location have cut my boys hair and they do a terrible job. on even hairs, marks of the blades . i had to go in once a second time just to get them to fix it. and they where outraged . but you could clearly see there mistakes . i'm not a hairstylist but i could see all their mistakes. this last time the guy took 40 min cutting my sons hair . at the end he didn't cut it like i asked for . the right side was higher then the left side. and the left side you couldn't even see the fade it was more like ""0"" and then all of a sudden boom there's hair ,straight into like a number 6. man will know what i'm talking about . my son does his hair to the side so you could imagen it"
i've been a regular customer here for a while. been through a couple of stylist and the one i enjoy the most is selena. she's very good and has a good eye. it's usually clean and don't really have to wait too long with the online checking in.
this place doesn't have wifi so that's the only draw back ... feels like an updated super cuts
"i have taken my son there more i would like to admit. i did go back repeatedly in hopes to get this one lady that had the best attitude as well as knew exactly what i wanted, i don't think she works there anymore, she is the only reason i'm giving this place two stars. sadly, he was stuck with others that did hack up jobs, aka uneven, hair in the back standing up because it was cut way too much. oh and their attitudes suck, listen to the other people that have stated the same. sorry that we bothered to come in for service, the last time i told the lady flat out (after her poor haircutting skills botched my kids head up again) i will never be back and i am definitely sticking to that word. don't waste your time or your money here, maybe re-training would be helpful. even some customer service classes may do this place justice."
"great clips is a hit or miss.of course, that depends on the person who is cutting your hair. they don't take appointments and you don't know who's working unless you call ahead of time. their staff schedule changes so it's kinda inconsistent.you do have the option of waiting for your stylist to be free. and i do like they save notes of your last hair cut. however, the numbers doesn't mean you'll have a 'great clip'the online check in system is odd --but i do like that you have an idea of how long you have to wait before you get to the store. maybe eventually, they should add their stylist schedule to the app.there is a loyalty program, which is 10 hair cuts = a free one.parking is always available, it's on the 3rd floor of the midtown plaza next to gnc and pizza rev.i really like niesha. she knows what's she's doing.i liked michael - but he no longer works there.i also liked xxx (i forgot her name) but she's a manager that is helping to open the glendale store.i usually go to ulta after my haircut --but that has nothing to do with this review.$16 for adults if you are wondering."
"will never come here again, it's funny how the owner of this place will offer u a coupon for a free hair cut for you next visit when they have already fucked up ones, ...  came in just to cut the sides and and trim the top, and i walked out bald.... don't come here employees look all tired and don't know what there doing"
"i came in today with pretty realistic expectations, knowing that i was at great clips and with a coupon from ralphs. as many say, you take a risk with budget haircuts. my stylist was a young woman with pink in her hair. i had arrived within an hour of closing, and the wait list was stacking up. she hurried me into my seat, asking me what i wanted before i even sat down.  i came in asking for an even cut, just to take off length (no layers, etc - just a straight cut). i usually have long hair but am not afraid of taking off 6+ inches at a time since shorter cuts usually gives me more time in-between salon visits. i showed her an approximate length to remove with my hands (8-10 inches) and apologized in advance for my hair, which was a wet and tangled mess from the pool. 1. she did not even bother to fully comb out my hair. she briefly whipped a comb through my hair, but there were still tangles and knots. to give some context, my hair looked ""wavy"" and yet i have pin-straight hair normally. 2. when she reached a particularly difficult knot, she flat out told me, ""you have a really bad knot. i don't know what you want me to do about it. you'll have to deal with it later."" 3. she hacked a chunk off my hair and started matching the length around the rest of my head. she was done in less than five minutes and handed me a mirror to approve. when i questioned the length being even, she then went back for another ten minutes actually double-checking her work (which i noticed she had never done) and even confessing, ""oh yeah, some parts were longer than others."" more snips, snips, snips to even everything out. 4. about halfway through the appointment she tells me, ""sorry. i forgot to ask you if you like having your hair parted on the side or in the middle. if you want your hair parted in the middle, i have to go back and fix the lengths again because i already cut with a side parting."" now, i really was fine with the side part which is why i did not say anything in the beginning, but i really did not trust her ability to tell if things were even - and a middle part just seemed simpler to tell symmetry. more snips, snips, snips. 5. at the end, i could still see uneven edges. she had already hacked off 30% more length than i wanted trying to ""fix"" all the uneven lengths. i was not willing to let her keep trying and leave me with nothing at all. i am now at home with a cut way shorter than i wanted and am terribly upset. pay the $10-15 extra dollars and go to fantastic sams. avoid the risk of this place."
"i got a haircut from the short hispanic lady. i'm a nice person and i was nothing but polite to her but she was so angry for some reason. she had all this pent up rage built up and took it out on me. she asked what i wanted to do to the back of my hair, ""clip or buzz"" i replied, saying i didn't know because for almost all my life i've had long hair and short hair was a new thing for me. i chose to clip.after that, i looked at it and saw it was still a little too long, so i asked if she could buzz it. she proceeded to get visibly angry but then starting buzzing the back of my neck. as a kid, i've gotten buzzcuts before and i know it doesn't take that long. she buzzed the back of my neck so much that it was soooo painful and the next day, i woke up with blood on my pillow. she must've just been buzzing skin because even i knew it shouldn't have taken that long.after that, it still looked a little funky so i asked if she could kind of fade it going up. she responded with ""first you want me to clip it, so i clipped it. then you wanted me to buzz it?? when is this going to end? i don't know what you want!""yes, she yelled at me in front of everyone over a harmless question. i replied with ""sorry, it's okay you don't have fade it then"" i'm really not sure what her problem was. she had so much rage hidden within her lmao. and on top of that she gave me one of the worst haircuts i've ever had if the person who gave me that awful haircut/bloody neck is reading this, i just wanna know why you were so angry that day lmaoo."
"the managers are very rude !! my boyfriend was there yesterday and he said the person that was in charge i believe his name is william shouted at the employees then took one of them in the office leaving a client in the chair and you can clearly hear the yelling , so unprofessional made my boyfriend feel uncomfortable in this salon and every time we go there we get rushed out . bad customer servic! they always have new people working there every time we go  maybe because of the managers bad attitude toward them. the other day  tameka the manager yelled at some clients because they were standing close to the stylist chair. very very rude !  i would give 0 star if i can"
"well i just got here and i can already tell you the customer service is pretty lousy.i checked in through yelp a few hours ago, and when i entered i was asked whether i checked in, so i replied yes. the hair stylist said their online system doesn't work sometimes so i should check in again through their web site. i asked ""if online isn't working, can i can check in in-person?"" which was ignored. so now i get to wait after three other people with no real apology, least of all acknowledgement.totally understood online systems sometimes don't work, but don't (1) not ask more details about the appointment i tried to make, or (2) ignore your customers. guess gc doesn't want my business!update: pretty good and efficient haircut. during my haircut though, one of the stylists was talking about the guests (including myself) in spanish, i guess assuming that we wouldn't understand."
i have gone there for almost two years now but i don't recommend it to my friends. they have done my hair uneven and i had to go somewhere else to get it fix. also when i took my little brother they cut his ear and it was bleeding!!! horrible the guy doing it didn't even tell me plus his hair cut was also uneven they made a bold spot on him .
"we came here simply because we did not want to wait at our usual barber shop.....i can honestly tell you, we are sold! the service we got was exceptional & the our hair looks fantastic (pic)we clearly found our new spot.sorry, ian we didn't come while you were still here!"
"i called this location and asked for today's availability.  the woman asked me to hold for a minute... when she came back on the line she said ""yes?""  i said ""yes?"" ""can i help you?"" she asked. ""you ask me to hold...?"" i responded. then i can't believe it when she tells me, ""whoa, calm down. this isn't the same person you talked to before.""seriously?? if they can't even handle a phone call, i doubt they can perform a haircut."
very good and patience with children.nancy was very good with my son who has a fear of getting his haircut. he was very happy
"i've been a client of great clips for a few years now unfortunately my usual salon got closed down. i checked in online and my wait went past 30 min the check in time. totally understandable if there was a big crowd but this was not the case. there was one worker standing by the register gossiping distracting the others cutting clients hair, supper annoying. after 30 or so min my son got called. he has never complained about a haircut in his life but this day he asked to never take him back. unfortunately this person has no experience with the tools she cut the back of his ear and lower neck, and quickly blamed it on him. she also didn't clean up his lower back line which is common when getting a fade. now i get kids move around but in his 8 years no one has cut him while cutting his hair. i will definitely no come back they sure lost a potential client.."
i usually never leave reviews but i've been coming here for quite some time now. i've always gone with denise & she's amazing! if you want somewhere where they have good customer service and know what they are doing come here! ask for denise and you won't disappointed.
"my son loves here to come get his haircuts. he has such a way if style and i love the fact that they save the information from the previous time so all i have to say is "" yup the same as last time "" lol so much easier . also i recommend you to download their app so you can check in before you get there so your wait won't be long."
"for thos guys who like to get half on the sides with a nice blend, do not go with shirley! she is horrible when it comes to that. she not only cut too much, but she does not know how to blend.  damn!!! very unhappy with my haircut.this will be the last time i go there because of this bad experience."
"came in today to see veronica for an overdue haircut. she's been cutting my hair for years, and is the only person who understands what i want without having to say much. i've gone through multiple hair styles with her, including long layers way past my shoulder blades, a-line bobs, and my current pixie with my mini taper fade. i've loved them all. i know i can always count on her for new styles, or just a simple clean up. thanks for always keeping me lookin' fabulous!!"
"i hadn't cut my hair in years due to salons attempting to pressure me into doing something i don't want + trying to upsell to something i don't need. today i had the pleasure of getting my hair cut by the stylist carla. she did a great job, made the experience extremely comfortable and quick, i felt at ease! i will definitely be back due to her outstanding customer service and have already recommended her to others."
"young and beautiful women at great clips the women put in work. i got a taper fade ""0"" both my son and i got our hair cuts here. my son got a lollipop and a sticker. that's better then a dumb ballon from supercuts great clips is where the clips are great. denise: gets down with the clippers"
they are awesome! the ladies there are super nice and make you feel at home. denise was amazing!! i'm super cautious about my hair and she made everything just perfect i usually doubt my hair after i leave but i felt pretty and had no doubt whatsoever!! thank you denise you are perfect!! don't go anywhere!!
this place is a joke..the two ladies especially the older hispanic lady were both condescending. the older hispanic lady doesn't know how to do a basic cut and booted me out of her chair and the other lady had to finish her job..pathetic..will never go back to this place again
i haven't had a bad haircut here since i started coming monthly since 2016. every stylist is easy to talk to when you have questions or want to change something up. recently i brought in a picture and had flor and she made an even better version on me.
"very pleased with my haircut, denise is amazing she's been doing my hair for 8 years now and i literally trust no one else with my hair! she knows exactly what i want and doesn't get scissor happy when she sees long hair like other salons i've been to. definitely coming back when it's time for a trim!"
"quick cut for my boys. you can check in online which i love. service is always fast and friendly. nice selection of hair products, too."
i tried to go to the nearby great clips but found they were closed. i called this location because i knew i would be cutting it close and didn't want to inconvenience them. they told me they would take me if i got there before 9pm. i rushed to their location and got there at 8:58pm. they were locked up and refused service. horrible customer service.
"i just got my hair cut here today. the worst hair cut i've ever had. she messed up my hair so bad. i showed her a picture of what i wanted. simple layers. it isn't even and looks horrible. i'm a teenage girl, i'm going to get made fun of so hard because of my haircut. don't come here, it isn't worth it."
"definitely would rather pay $60 for a decent haircut then $15 for a sloppy job.as usual, they didn't listen to what i wanted but instead what they want. i only wanted my ends to be cut to minimum and she assured me ""only the tips and minimum "" even showed me how much she was going to cut.. well at the end she said i took all the ends off and i came home to more then one and half inches off and one side was shorter then the other. i wear clip in extensions so now i can't due to how awful the cut is.. my friend and i will definitely not return. nor i will recommend this place. don't want my money back. i will have to wait for my hair to grow and go to a real hairstylist!"
"i just want to let everyone know that i recommend verónica, she is such a great stylist! she gave me the best haircut, wash and blow dry. she knows exactly what she's doing and listens to what you ask for. thank you veronica for making me feel beautiful!"
"got my haircut by veronica, i've had my hair cut by her before and she always does a great job. never disappoints me and always exceeds my expectations!"
"service : quick stop for a haircut, the lady who cut my hair is awesome.i loved my hair! she's very detailed with what i want.note: you need to log in on th website to be able to check in and be on the list. it will show you how long is the wait. is close by costco too.price: $15 haircut  parking: street or parking lot"
"i went in with my friend to get a hair cut. my friend supposed to have a bob style hair cut and i just needed my bang cut. my person still works on my bang but my friend hair cut was done.i was chocked. i look at my friend's hair and it was a sloppy work. some of her strands are more than a centimeter longer than the others.we had to walk back to get it fix by someone else. still, both of the stylists did not shave the back of her neck! these people give great clips a bad name!i was gonna no star but i gave two for mine since i have no complaint for mine."
"i've been here several times since this location opened last year.  the parking is hell on earth, because it's in the same plaza as the costco, but you don't have to wait if you check in online ahead of time!  i remember coming in on a busy weekend, and there were at least 4-5 people waiting, putting their names down.  i walked right up and was seated in a salon chair first, because my name was on the online check in, #1 spot!  all the other people in the waiting area gave me the wtf looks, ha.every member of my immediate family has been here, and it's a decent job each time for the price.  the best part, i got a ton of coupons for 2017 last year- for $9.99 cuts.   i handed them out to my friends like candy, and two of my friends used them.i usually see two, older ladies working when i'm there.  they are nice and do a decent job.  one time, a patron was mumbling and acting like an asshole to the cashier, i stared him down and ending up tipping the nice stylist extra because some people can just be mean unnecessarily."
"i love great clips and i love that this location opened close to home. i went in the staff was friendly and location was clean. i met my new stylist, maria f. she totally understands my hair and my needs. i have been to see her about 4 times now and i love my hair!!! she's definitely a character, but that's what makes her great! doesn't hurt that she's an awesome stylist too"
"good cuts for kids. no waiting this sunday morning. denise and maria did a great job. this place is only for haircuts. so make sure you know what you want. bring a photo or take a photo on your phone-is highly suggested. i was looking for may as she is the best, but call ahead to find out her schedule. all in all the girls are fine."
"i came in after work for a bang trim and maria was the one to cut my hair when she was going to call out my name, she looked at my name all weird like a substitute teacher taking role and scared to mess up a students name. i mean you don't hear the name season a lot but still i am your customer and you have the nerve to criticize my parents for giving me a unique name instead of ""any other generic name"". when i told her i wanted a bang trim she acted like it was a hassle and that she won't that much money on me. when she thinned out my bangs she used the thinning scissors way to high up to the point that i have short hairs fraying out of my bangs! how hard can you mess up a bang trim?! if you had a bad day lady you shouldn't take it out on your customers."
this used to be fantastic sam's. i left when they closed down and my hairstylist left and that is mei. but she is back. she is very popular because she knows how to cut asian heads with hair.
i am kind of glad i walked out when i did the staff is rude especially the elderly lady maria. yelling at her co worker i felt uneasy being in there and so i left i told her i had signed in but was leaving bc all i wanted was a simple trim and she gave me a dirty look didn't even say anything. not going back never! guess it was a sign
"the place is great but staff is very rude and unprofessional especially her name is ""maria"""
"my new go to hair stylist is selena. so i came here after the holidays since i was in the area shopping and thankfully was quickly seated with selena for a haircut. usually i'm super basic and just get the clippers shortening my hair to a length i'm used to and have rocked that style for 90% of my life and mentioned that i was looking for a new look but had no idea what to even attempt. i told selena ""i'm trusting you to make me attractive"" and she gave me a fade which is a style i've never considered. thanks and i'll be back!"
"cheap prices like supercuts but way worse results. i'm not ageist but i knew i was in trouble when i walked in and it was just 3 older ladies waiting for their next victim. and for a place with no other customers i have no idea why the one that took me was in such a rush. 5 minute haircut with no exaggeration. snip snip snip and then she basically pushed me out of the chair. no fine tuning, no offer for product just a ""you're done, get out"". she also called me hairy which was odd. yeah i have hair and want it cut but i don't think anybody else has ever described me as hairy."
maria - very rude to her customers and co-workers. avoid at all costs!i'm going to call ahead to see who is working whenever i need a haircut.
wow! unable to follow directions on the hair cut. both of my boys had to sit back down with different people to get the hair cut we verbally requested. if there was a negative -1 i would leave that. smh
"i actually hate this location so much. i've been going to great clips for about 2 years now, going to a riverside location and back here when i'm in the area. this one is horrible. i've been here 3 times and 2/3 times, i've had the worst haircuts of my life. my first mess up here, they were nice and all, but my chair was flipped around the whole entirety of my haircut. when she finished (cannot recall her name), i was practically bald on the sides of my head. that was her definition of a ""fade"". i didn't bother reviewing even then but fast forward to today, i was furious. i got cared for extremely fast, but the lady, ""maria"", had such a horrible attitude. she was a carefree older woman, but did not let me finish talking. she prompted to ask about my sides and i tried telling her what i wanted overall and she cut me off 3 times, ""only the sides"". i would try to continue but she would repeatedly shush me. i am an extremely patient guy but also very anxious with all the bad hair cuts i've gotten in my life. maria is extremely rough and careless with her close cut razor and when she cut my ear, i said ow pretty loud but she just ignored me. i wanted to cut the top but at that point, i did not even trust her anymore. i told her really short on the top but she prompted that she had it under control. moreover, at the end, she scratched up my neck even worst than my ears. my haircut overall was extremely amateur and i am so dissapointed in this establishment. i don't get why this place hires such horrible people."
"i will preface this review with the usual, your miles may vary... i've been to several super cuts and also fantastic sams before... great clips is the newer chain that i finally tried out. for the most part, i've had okay to good experiences to most of these chains. i have had a few really bad experiences... but keep in mind that can happen with any type of business experience. i don't fault these types of places because they serve a niche... but you can sometimes truly say ""you get what you pay for..."" at least there is more a chance of that at places like this because you generally will see newer stylists with a whole lot less experience. and you typically may pay more for those that have more experience. that statement isn't 100% since sometimes i've had great experiences and haircuts from stylists at super cuts and felt it was a better haircut than the fancier more expensive (almost twice as much) places i've gone to as well. i generally pick to go to places like this because i didn't have time to go to my regular person and just want something quick and affordable. my hair is always cut short and it's pretty simple imho.in general, this place is well kept. very new looking, and clean. the shopping center shares a parking lot with costco alhambra... and to be honest, the parking here is probably some of the worst in la county. so definitely not convenient during costco hours. i came around 7:30 pm, so i did manage to find a parking spot right out front. there were only 2 people stylists when i got there. i did like that you could check-in online and i got a discount on the visit... when i got there, i had a tickle in my throat and had a coughing fit. the lady who cut my hair offered me a bottle of water, so if not for that and the discounted haircut, i probably would have given a 2.5 star for this stylist. she was really nice and the bottle of water showed good customer service, but that can only cover so much of a lack of experience or ability. as i mentioned, there was another stylist providing a haircut already when i arrived... so i assume that maybe he was halfway done? well, i love a quick haircut... but i was done with my haircut had her wash my hair (paid and was out the door) and the other stylist was still not done with the other gentleman's haircut. so perhaps that tells you something... i basically told the woman that i wanted about a 2 on the sides and back... which basically meant i just wanted a trim. i sometimes have gone short like a 1 or 1.5 with a fade, but when i try new stylists, i play it safe and don't go too short until i know they know what they are doing. by the time i was done, i knew my hair wasn't cut evenly. when she stopped to show me her work, she ran her hands through my hair to check the levels... and there were obvious areas that were way off in terms of length. lol. she did correct that, but thankfully she didn't try too hard to compensate because it could have gotten way worse. luckily my hair is styled in a way that can hide the poor haircut... at least until it starts to grow out and get long... then it becomes more obvious. the lady was on the shorter side... and i'm 6'... so she might have had a harder time seeing the top of my head if i'm sitting... but if she was having difficulty she could have asked me to slouch down to make it easier for her...anyway... the experience will get a 3 star... but i likely would avoid this place in the future... if i was really desperate to go back, i would wait for someone else besides the lady. i wish i could recall her name in case some of you are wondering who to avoid... granted perhaps you would have a better experience then me or over time, maybe she will improve, but i won't be 'chancing it' again... when you play russian roulette with your hair, you might as well try someone else next time..."
"i rarely decide to write bad reviews, but this time i wanted to write one almost right away. i went last sunday to get my hair cut, from long length to shoulder length, bob alike, with layers in the back. the man who was doing my hair seemed ok, no problems with anything. he seemed knowledgeable. i had thought to myself that a man will probably make my hair look horrible, but i gave him a chance. so when he was done, my hair was still wet, and it looked great. i was happy. i didn't do much with it the rest of the day, let it dry. today in the morning, when i was styling it, i took a mirror and when i saw the back of my hair i almost dropped the mirror. he simply cut a ""lawyer"" of my hair horizontally two inches from the bottom from right to left. it looked like a huge step from one ""layer"" to the second one. there was so layers! it was a mess, butchered, and cut stupidly. my 5 month old would have done a better job! i had one a meeting at my job today and i tried not to turn backwards to anyone, so embarrassing. during my lunch i went to my hairstylist, and she fixed it the best possible. it still looks kinda off, but much muuuuuuch better. so....if you go there don't expect too much, and try to have a lady cut your hair. i'm really mad, and i'm considering calling my bank to dispute the payment."
"i just got my hair cut here again today because i had such a good experience here the last time and the price is good. today's experience was, unfortunately, not as good. the person who cut my hair was heidi. when i got home i noticed that there was a piece of hair that was still long so i had to trim it myself. one side of my hair is also longer than the other side. good thing i always wear my hair in a ponytail so it won't be noticeable. i think i will be going to a different place next time or ask for mollie instead if she's there."
"oh man. went for a trim on my long layers. the lady had no idea what she was doing. they're serious when they say ""you get what you pay for"". first the two ladies took 5 minutes in how to spell my name for the check in. they finally asked me to write it in a post it. she sat me down and i showed her a picture...i've never had uneven layers...not to mention the way she cut my layers...it was tugging on my hair and i just felt split ends galore! i'll never go here again. i miss the old fantastic sams :( also i noticed they don't have their licenses in cosmetology posted like most hair places. i should of known better than to sit down!! :( on a good note the little asian lady was nice but she kept asking me how to cut my hair when i was trusting her as the stylist to know what to do. now i gotta go pay to fix what she did. i guess i'll be getting a real haircut for 5x the price..."
"had an awful experience today. went in for a trim and to just clean up the sides. maria checked me in. marlene did a terrible job with the trim. she cut way too much off all around, used the clippers and buzzed the sides so short my scalp shows. now my hair is oddly shaped, sticks out in the wrong places and is cut at different lengths. she doesn't know how to cut hair. she said she cut it the way ""she"" thinks looks good, not how i wanted it. never ever will i send anyone else to this salon. i asked her to contact the manager (heidi?) so i may speak with her and she refused. marlene should not be cutting hair. there was so much more wrong with marlene and what she was saying that the other employee who checked me in was there shaking her head too and agreeing with me."
don't go here! they do not know how to cut hair! i'd give them no stars if i could! we went there for a simple fade and they got all pissy when we told them we didn't like it. they gave my bf the worst haircut ever. i mean you're not supposed to see a like in the hair!
i want to give a shout out to marlita at the rancho marketplace great clips. she is by far the best stylist that has ever cut my hair and trimmed my beard. marlita is a true professional stylist. i highly recommend her.
"no rating!  a big ""0""!  i went there this weekend to have a trim!  i have a picture of how i want my hair trim!  jennifer was the one who chopped my shoulder length hair!  it was so short that i could've do a pony tail especially when i workout at the gym!  i was in tears when i got home!  will never go to this place again!  jennifer should be fired!!!! !"
"i really wish i could give them a good review. they are affordable, friendly and clean. but they didn't just do an average job on my son's hair, they butchered it. it was worse than i could do, and i am a terrible hair cutter. the fella who cut my son's hair was incredibly nice and tried his best... but it was so bad i had to go to another barber for cleanup. we will not be returning."
"i finally got the app to check in online as some customers got in ahead of me and suggested i do that. it really didn't help. it was the equivalent of walking in. it is also difficult to get any kind of discount (they had coupons and saturday specials the first few months they opened at burbank rancho) and even offered a discount when checking in using the app. all gone now. i found a val pack coupon online and they gave me a ""pass"" to use it. i waited a long time"
i checked in online saturday afternoon and only had a short wait when i arrived at the location. marlita did an exceptional job on my hair. i'm in the midst of growing out a pixie cut and she talked through some options with me that would let me keep sone length while giving me a cute cut that looks great. she was knowledgeable about the different options and how the whole cut would come together; she asked a lot of questions to get an idea of what i wanted before she started cutting and checked in throughout the cut to make sure it was shaping up as i had in mind. i was only visiting the area and don't know when i'll be back but i'd gladly go to her again.
"i recently moved to los angeles, and had been looking for a good place to get my hair cut. normally i go to a barbershop back home that does a good job, but when i am strapped for cash i go to great clips. i don't expect great work from them, but for $16 plus tip i expect to at least get some kind of good cut... this did not happen. the barber (leaving his name out of this, because he is a good guy, but bad barber) used the clippers on the top of my head first, and then proceeded to just move it about my head. at this point, it was better to just let him finish, but there was nothing he did that i couldn't have done better. it's safe to say that i got butchered, and i will never be going to another chain barbershop again."
"beyond upset with my hair cut. they butchered it :'''(   my hair looks like repunzels hair after that guy chops it all off :/  and why is the front longer then the back??  that's what i get for being cheap.  only when here cuz i had a coupon.  oh oh and on top of that, i was telling the lady how i wanted my hair and she was telling me no and i should do blah blah because blah blah!! nope nope never again.  i have to go get it fixed but i'm scared :( traumatized for life."
"i have been here three times. the first time one of my best haircuts in awhile from the very talented black woman who works there. the second time an older (asian?) man who was very rough and nicked me several times. tonight i went there and had the same asian man. i was hesitant to ask for someone else but i decided to try him again. ouch. not only he was rough, but now i have several huge cuts on my neck that hurt and look awful. i'm 42, never have i been cut so bad.. this guy needs to go back to school. ouch. beware."
"i walked in an hour before closing time (they close at 9pm). i was hurried over by an asian fella (recto, i believe his name is) who seemed nice. turns out, i picked the wrong fella and time to have my hair cut and show up because he ruined the little bit of hair i have. my advice to anyone else is skip this fella, he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to working with clippers."
my wife and i just had our hair cut here for the first time and couldn't be more happy. i suggest doing the online check in because we were put next in line upon arrival.
"all i have to say is... marlita, marlita... marlita!! i have been to many many salons and barbers around burbank, including floyd's.. and no one listens or can get anything right!  until... marlita. i just stopped in on a whim the day they opened. she not only listens, but she talks you through the entire cut to make absolutely sure that you are getting what you want. great personality and very professional. everyone at this location seems very nice, but marlita is the one to go to. now, not only do i have a new stylist... but so does my brother, my nephew, my niece and my mom. so yes, she is a pro at cutting and styling both men and women at a price that for sure would be a whole lot more elsewhere!"
"to cut very long hair, salons in the area are priced at $55 to $105. usually, i'd get a groupon and wait a week to get an appointment for cheaper, with someone who isn't great at communicating (or enthusiastic for groupon customers.)so, i decided to try the newly constructed great clips in burbank, and i ended up with a salon-quality haircut for $16! the best part was the wait time--about 5 minutes on a saturday afternoon. catrina is the very friendly and talented stylist who took genuine care in delivering exactly what i'd imagined. i would go here before everyone else discovers this gem! you can always check in online or use their app to reserve a spot ahead of other walk-ins."
"no good. beginner level cutting. not worth the $8.99 price. lack customer service skills, unprofessional and unpleasant attitude, and most importantly sad haircut."
"i got a coupon for $9.99 haircut so i decided to try them out. i only needed a trim this time. i like that they have an online check in option which also shows the wait time, there was parking, and it wasn't crowded when i showed up. they saw me right away, i'm happy with my trim, and they honored my coupon. the inside was clean and they had colorful partitions between the salon seats. they are also offers for veterans on veterans day which is nice. i was served by jennifer who was great."
go to marlita...she's laid back and listens...she communicates what she's working with before she does it.  i got a coupon and booked online and i was in and out...i dislike haircuts but this was painless
"first time going to this location and horrible customer service!!! my family and i walked in and no one acknowledged us and didn't check us in for good 10-15 mins. then the lady (jennifer) who took us had no exp of dealing with customers, she was rude, i was giving her description of what type of haircut and she literally walked away while i was still talking. i was dumbfounded that she actually walked away to the back while i was standing there talking. when she got back and i confronted her about how rude it was what she did, jennifer replied "" well i ashtray got what type of haircut you need"", really!!!! reverse the roles how the hell would you feel if i have you that type of customer service. my family and i are never coming back to this place just for the fact of what type of treatment we got as customers. sad part is the haircut was great but i believe in service especially when i was respectful and move and did not deserve this from her. maybe she is nice to only certain type of ppl and myself and my family didn't fit the criteria. horrible customer service...."
when i walked in a man named oscar began to cut my hair. well lets just say it was bad. and then proceeded to talk bad about my mom who was telling him what he did wrong. i am 15 he should not be saying stuff like that to me. but then a girl named jenifer fixed it and was very nice to us which made the experience a lot better!  after that as we were walking out oscar apologized which made the experience a little better.
"we told the stylist to cut our child's hair a certain way and he just butchered it!  it was like he wasn't listening to what we wanted...he had a set way in his mind the way it should look like and just went with it.  however, i reached out to the owner, who invited me back to have the haircut redone.  the second time around was much better...but i should not have to return to a place to have a mistake re-done!  they should get it right the first time...that is just plain common sense and professionalism."
"i'm not a fan of these timed haircut chop shops! i have  spontaneously & mistakingly been to 3 great clips in the area in the past 16 mos, if i see there is no wait.    ** 1st) they never use a neck strip between you & the apron they have used on dozens of customers w/warts, moles, blisters, boils,scabs, etc.. they are spreading highly contagious crap! ( if you don't believe me, feel the back of your neck or your significant other or son!! guys, where do you think those bumps came from??!!??!!  this is unsanitary and illegal, please report them to the cal state board of cosmetology or barbering immediately, they need retrained asap!!  ** 2nd) just as soon as they get started cutting your hair the telephone rings or someone comes in to be waited on & sure as you are the one in the middle of the haircut, they will stop and wait on whomever and whatever & then try to up-sell them some hair product while you wait, & then as they finally come back to you and apologize they forget what they were doing and one sideburn goes to your chin & the other is trimmed above the ear and same in the back of your head where you can not see when they spin you around to check your haircut in their hurry to get the next victim!  do not tip if you are not satisfied, it's the whole reason why we do or don't leave gratuities!  it's not an entitlement !  ***did they do a good job? ***were they personable? ***did they give your service undivided attention? ***are you happy w/the end result? *** did you double check the service and what you asked for, or did they rush you to get next client in the chair?  *** if they rushed you, they need more stylists*** you are doing no one a favor by tipping therm generously & having to go elsewhere to start your haircut over again! *** there are many wonderful barbershops & stylists in socal area !!    especially along magnolia or burbank blvd !!    ** another reason i'm a tough critique on the chain type shops, is i went to cosmetology school & was a sales person for a top shelf hair product & if you have seen what i have seen as far as unsanitary, believe me, you would be hopping  out of that chair if they don't use a neck strip!**  other reason is i have had to go to doctor to get boils removed from bak of my neck due to their laziness ! not much fun injections and scalpels cutting these ugly things out,  & the root is usually deeper than what they cut out!  neck strips are very cheap to buy & only take 5-10 seconds to put around your neck under the apron!   god be with you!"
i walked in a had a standard shampoo and blow out. the staff was very professional and friendly. the salon was very clean.  i had no appointment but i was taken care of right away. i love how it turned out and i believe i have found my new salon!
"i took my grandson for a haircut and he loved it, although forgot the name of the person who cut. i have curly hair and need a straight blow dry every week and took a chance at this salon, since they do more quick haircuts.christina did a wonderful wash and blow dry asking questions what i would like, and was pleased with the results.i went back and marisol did the blow dry using a shine product,  she was quick and hair was silky feel.  note:  if you wash your hair at home you save $$ since the store will charge for a shampoo."
"sport clips, the place to get an affordable haircut in la canada ($22), has a new competitor. great clips is a chain of hair salons specializing in affordable haircuts ($15). when they first opened, the cuts were $7.99 (opening special). that lasted a few weeks. now the cuts are $9.99, though i'm not sure how long that promotional price will last.the location is convenient - right next to gelson's. there's plenty of parking. the location isn't busy yet. you can check in and see what the waiting times are by going to the great clips website or downloading the great clips app. that's definitely a nice feature. i think the chain is good about sending out occasional coupons. it's pretty no frills but it gets the job done. they also sell haircare products. sport clips customers all seem to be men and boys.  great clips feels more unisex."
"came in with a $9.99 coupon for a haircut, usually $17.00. katsama was my stylist and she did a great job, just a #1 buzz on the sides and back of my head, easy peazy. great conversation. definitely would come back when my usual stylist in glendale is $21.00 plus tip."
really disappointed with my daughter's haircut today. uneven and not a nice cut at all. will not go back.
"i went there due to the convenient location and grand opening special ($8.99).  esmeralda did such a terrible job... here are the lowlights:it took almost an hour to do what normally takes about 15-20 minutes (i just ask for 2 on the sides, finger-length up top, far from rocket science.)i told her at least five times that it was too long up top, but the message was never quite received as intended.  when she asked what i meant and where, she lifted up a spot on the left side and asked, ""here?""  i said, ""yes, and everywhere else up top.""  so she just trimmed the left side slightly, and that's how i ended up with a quasi-bowl cut that was longer on the right side than the left.when she showed me the back, i was disturbed, to say the least.  i said, ""ummmm... it looks like wolverine back there.""  her response, ""what?  oh yeah, i see what you mean.  it's naturally curly back there.""  first time i'd heard that.  and it's not curly if you actually, you know, cut it.she also wouldn't cut a portion of my hair because of a ""cowlick"".  that was a new first as well.at the end she goes, ""would you like some product?  it should help.""i laughed/cried about it to some other people who had gone to this location, and they had similar horror stories.  for a store that was only two weeks old at the time (i had to wait some time to post this until the yelp page was up), that's pretty impressive.i went elsewhere to get it fixed the next morning, and they simply could not believe i had gotten a haircut the previous day.  the back was still a bit of a mess afterwards, such was the damage done.  time was the only thing that could help that at that point.i also texted a buddy that if he got esmeralda, flee immediately.  he did not heed my warning and had to go get it fixed as well.sad, because the location is quite convenient.  oh well."
great barbershop! reasonable prices and friendly barbers--i'm so pleased with my third cut from them. wafa and mckindly were terrific. go there for your next clip.
"i saw the previous review and was surprised...i was in and out in no time.  it may be that i came in the morning on a weekday.  the manager was very friendly and sat me down right away.  now i am a 53 year old man with thinning hair so i don't imagine i would have the problems as the last reviewer, but she was able to provide exactly what i asked for.  i have since gone back.  i appreciate that they keep there cutting instruments clean with disinfectant.  the previous salon i went to also did a good job, but in about a week the back of my neck would break out.  i finally caught on that it was in relation to the timing of my haircut and the last time i went i spent particular attention to if they cleaned their instruments...they did not, therefore i am making this place (great clips) my new spot!"
this is our favorite spot to get our sons hair cut at! they are so good with him! thanks for an awesome experience
"cliped my hair at this location. it was good experience barber lady was gentle and polite. she did what i need in my hair cut and she asked me how is it in each stage, which was impressive. would go their for my hair cuts from now, i guess."
"friendly enough staff, usually has 93.1 jack fm playing rather loudly on the radio. i like that they save your haircut preferences so it doesn't really matter who cuts your hair. some stylists are more chatty than others."
it's my second time coming here... i love the check online part.. it saves me time and best part i love the prices. staff is very friendly
i come here once or twice a month and i am taken care of. i have never left unhappy. no one cuts my hair like they do...i love great clips
"great clips is a good place to go and cut your hair. dolly cut my hair she had cut it the way i wanted i recommend you guys to ask for dolly to cut your hair but not only dolly ,cynthia, adriana, susy and the other girls who work there! they are all very good"
i've been bringing my son here since they opened. he's always happy with his results. my wife and other son have started going here too. i cut my own hair or else i'd likely get haircuts here too. great job!
this place is great because they keep your measurements from each time so you don't have to constantly re-explain yourself. additionally they are very affordable and work at a nice pace. finally they are pretty understanding of those who don't want to talk a whole bunch; but they have nice hair tips if you want them.
i like to come see kao because he is pretty laid back and is pretty cool to chat with when he's cutting my hair. he understands how i want my hair cut.**update- i found out that kao doesn't work here anymore and decided to make a life decision so that was the last time i visited this one but they are nice here but just go to a different great clips and get my hair cut by someone who knows kao small world haha *****update even more- i continue to visit great clips even though now both of those gentlemen are gone. the experience is great and i love the online checkin. download the app and you can check in before you go and you have your spot in line held. it's convenient enough at the moment. not a great deal check in online but it is catching on!
kinda bummed just left and the sign in store said get $5 off haircut if you leave a review or check in whatever i did and only got $2 off that's sucks and realized she didn't ask to do my eyebrows damn it now gotta go home and do myself and i tipped $7 on a $13 haircut. i'm done gonna just find a new place
needed a quick hair cut before vacation. came here and was pleased with the service. shop is clean. it does get busy so using their online check-in is the way to go. overall good experience.
this has been my go to place for a haircut for the past 2 years. i never really know what i want for my cut but i always leave looking much better than when i arrive. thanks cynthia for my last cut!
"i always come to this location and they do a good job every time. the place is clean and everyone is friendly. online check-in will help save time, so i recommend that. prices are fair as well."
this has been my go to place for haircuts! great cut every time.  my son used to hate getting haircuts until he came here.
it was so professional and they were so understanding to what i wanted to do with my hair. i got a wash and a haircut & i was pleased with everything (: amazing service!
told them once how we like it and they've gotten it right ever since. they let you check in online and tell you their wait times which is convenient. the coupons they send in the mail is also helpful.
great place to get haircut professional and knowledgeable also like the idea of the online check in!
"convenient location in dtf, took me in with no wait and no appointment, got a quick cut and am very happy. clean shop inside and everyone in her greeted me with smile. adrianna is awesome"
my go to place for a quick cut or trim. always friendly and helpful staff. very clean. love the ability to check in online.
we always bring our two younger boys here for cuts and they always look great. my daughter loves to get her layers done here as well and they always listen to what she wants.
"like any other great clips, this place gives a good value for money. however, among all the other great clips around this area, i prefer this one particularly because i get my haircut from a hairstylist named hatem. he can cut your hair to the exact specifications that you want. he is very efficient with the old school scissor and comb method which is rare to find these days. in addition, ever since i've been visiting this great clips i've been getting a good number of coupons every now and then which makes me stick to this great clips."
awful. i couldn't get my daughter off the chair fast enough.  she even got poked in the eye!
"really???? for a 14 bucks of hair cut i have to tolerate this kind of service in essex st, lodi, nj 07644.i checked online with no wait time and reached there in time, then the lady there told  me that i will be the next person to be attended. i was a regular customer to this branch and never seen this kind of attitude before. after that the lady keep on attending one after one customer who came after me and didn't even bother to ask  me if i have an appointment or not.seems like they don't want to do business anymore and somehow i have a feeling that they really don't care of their customer. really ??? for a haircut business you think you are the only one?this was my last visit and will never go to any of the branch. bye bye... keep your service and attitude to yourself and will not bother you any more.buyer please be aware of this place before you go."
"whats the point of checking in online if it says 0 minutes wait---and when you get there to wait for 30 min so the people can give their relatives and friends haircuts first.  seriously, what is the point of your online check in app?"
"if i could give this negative five stars i would. let me start by saying i have been coming here for three years for my son and parents. i also am not the kind of reviewer who would give any place 1 star - i generally take to yelp for giving 4 /5 stars. i was here for a quick trim and the person there ( i think his name was hatem or hateem or something ) kept making comments about my hair that were making me uncomfortable. since he was the only stylist available i went to his booth. 10 minutes into the trim i realized he was rubbing his ""junk"" against my knee! i was so creeped out i ran out of there. i will be taking it up with their headquarters and telling everyone i know! do not go here and do not take your children young or old! creepy cheap guy!"
"my husband got the worst haircut ever from this location and the hair dresser had no remorse about her pathetic work. please make sure to ask prior your haircut if they are using scissors or clipper machine. if the person use machine, you might end up getting the worst haircut of your life. they don't even adjust or trim side burns."
"so i just love when i can write a positive review about a business.for many years, i've paid a lot of money for hair cuts that ranged from 'good"" to ""ok"" but never completely satisfied.  i've seen ppl come out of this salon with really good looking cuts &  smiles on their faces.last thursday i really wanted to uplift my spirits because i've been ill for about a year, so i decided to get my hair done but didn't know where to go since i've been disappointed , but then i remembered seeing good looking cuts & the happy faces & i decided to give this place a try and im so glad i did!!!crissy greeted me & asked what i would like done with my hair. she did such a fabulous on my hair, my customers complimented my hair, my female customers asked where i got it cut & by whom, even strangers in the supermarket stopped me to compliment my hair. not only is she talented & loves what she does, but she makes you feel like a friend.i'm sure everyone there is wonderful, but i've only dealt with crissy. i highly recommend this salon & they run specials which helps the wallet. thank you crissy for making look & feel great"
i was recommended by a friend to get my hair cut with janine. she was very friendly and gave me an amazing hair cut. the staff are friendly too.
"i needed a basic cut. i had never heard of this place. i stopped in on saturday, the wait was an hour, but i didn't have time.  the guy couldn't have been nicer to me.  i went back tonight at 8:10 and the 2 women there were accommodating, funny, friendly, and i got a great hair cut.  and had a few laughs in the process.  very great vibe, great music and seems like a family place also. i will absolutely be back."
good haircut every time. doesn't matter what seat you're in. everyone's really good. you can tell they like their jobs. that's who you want cutting your hair.
"this is the go to place for my family. nielsa has been cutting my son, wife and my hair for years. we love going there and catching up and always getting the haircut we want. highly recommend!!"
"great haircut by mario! highly recommend going here, my friend had a great stylist as well! nessa i think. definitely will be back!"
i go here all the time. they do an awesome job. the girl that cuts my hair is nielsa. if you want her to cut your hair you're probably going to have to wait on line. people always ask for her personally. the wait is worth it though
"i needed a quick trim and didn't want to pay salon prices. came here, was served promptly, and the stylist cut my hair exactly as i instructed. all for $13. i guess my only gripe would be you certainly don't get salon treatment/service here. but again $13 for a quick and decent trim, so i'm not complaining."
"no complaints here! great haircut for a great price!  my whole family gets their hair cut there.  we mostly go to jennifer, so i can't really comment on the other hair dressers.  jennifer does a phenomenal job!  make sure you check in on their site before hand to cut your wait time a bit.  i didn't have to wait at all last time i went!"
stopped in yesterday for a great cut. kevin knew exactly what would look right and he worked his magic flawlessly and efficiently. a positive vibe from all employees means a concerned business owner. bravo and keep up the good work!
"worst hair cut experience i've ever had. i came because the place was recommended  to me by a friend because she really likes a specific hairdresser. when i arrived, she wasn't there but i figured anyone would be okay because they had such positive reviews here. i don't know the name of the person who got me because she wasn't wearing a name tag and she didn't introduce herself. she had straight blonde shoulder length hair (think, 'i want to talk to the manager white bitch' hair). she didn't smile at me or make me feel welcome at all when i was sitting down. while cutting my hair, she kept insulting my hair, saying it's too dry, the ends are too brittle, etc, but didn't really offer any tips besides just 'use leave in conditioner.' i get that upselling can be annoying, but after insulting my hair that many times, you'd think she'd be a halfway competent  employee and at least offer a suggestion. i have long hair and i asked for layers and granted while i did say 'keep the length,' she took it as i'll take a centimeter off the bottom, and she construed 'layers' i'll give you one layer in addition to the bottom of your hair. so yes, i technically got 'layers,' as in my hair has only two layers and barely different than when i came in. i am beyond disappointed and humiliated by this place and i urge any other girl with long hair to stay away. it's just not worth it. go to a real salon, even if they charge more because any paying customer should not be treated like she treated me."
"we had a coupon for $6.99 haircut and my husband usually goes to super cuts so i said why not try something else? he liked it. clean place, no wait time. we were taken care of right away. would definitely go there myself for a trim or a cut. a star for cleanliness, another for good service, 3rd for no wait time and 4th for the coupon !"
"just got back after getting an amazing haircut from a great stylist named kevin. i couldn't recommend him enough, makes getting a great haircut easy by explaining different aspects about it so you know what your asking for all while giving off good vibes and making you feel at home in the chair."
silly to pay salon prices when this is around the corner. i've always had my cut done by gina and she's great!check in online before you go to ensure you're seen quickly. and don't forget to ask for gina!
this is the best place around to get your haircut. the staff is the best and does a great job. they are very friendly and make sure your cut comes out perfect. thanks for the consistenly great haircuts!
giving 3 stars because they are severely understaffed and you always  wait 30 minutes or more even when using online checkin. good haircuts but waiting and waiting is ridiculous. hire more stylists and i will change my rating. one of the stylists is quite abrupt and has little patience especially with children.
clean place; very friendly....but i was told 30min wait and it's been well over an hour. needless to say; i'm not very happy. luckily i get a buzz cut at a level 1 1/2 so can't mess that up....hopefully.
you get what you pay for. not bad for children's haircuts $11.00. definitely check in online to avoid the wait.  they need to hire someone to keep this place clean. their is hair all over the salon. its pretty gross.
pretty decent place for a haircut. location is pretty convenient in a strip mall shopping center by 440 in bayonne. it's slightly quicker in terms of traffic as coming from jc wouldn't have to deal with the tonnelle circle traffic so its not a bad choice if you're in jc. price is pretty standard ($14 for men's haircut) and so is the service. i think the lady that cut my hair was bit more inexperienced but she was quite friendly so overall the experience is pretty decent. the building is quite clean as expected and i didn't have to wait at all on a weeknight so those are quite pleasant indeed :-)
worst hair stylist.  please look at the picture i uploaded of my husband who just returned from a lousy haircut. a pair of scissors in the hands of a 13-year old can ensure a better haircut.
need to start taking my 12 year old to a better place. there's a new hack every time we walk in. they hardly listen to any change from your last profile. beyond rude.
"worst customer service. planned my day and and to save time i checked in online which showed 20 mins wait.. reached the place 15 mins after check-in and was asked to wait. 3 others checked after me and saw my name 2nd in the list on the display. however they made me wait another 25 mins while they provided service to all others in the list until i was the only one left.  didn't have the courtesy to let me know what's going on. well, online check-in probably means bottom of the list for them. who knows how much longer they were gonna take before my turn.after such a waste of time didn't care to get a cut anymore and left.  never going there again"
"this place sucks like anything. had a lousy and crappy haircut . never get a haircut here at least from the person who did my haircut, shanette( deserves the name here due to the rudeness)when i called back, she was rude and hung up. never going back  and lost a recurring business for at least 2 yrs"
"this place is the worst!! i will never go back to this place again. stay away!! gloria and shannette were the corner stone of this place. shannette is a very talented hair stylist. she used to cut my hair, my daughter's and my son's. she is amazing!! she is also very nice, funny and talented. i was so disappointed to hear she was gone.gloria also is very talented she used to cut my wifes hair. i went in the other day, only to find out that they are both gone!! unbelievable..rumor was they were mistreated and managers used to curse at them in front of customers. my son needed a haircut so i walked in to see if someone would cut his hair, and to my surprise all you can hear is gossip and cursing from the two african american ladies talking about their employees. that is so unprofessional!!!  calling them b*tches and talking about  them in front of other customers really!! i was so embarrassed my 9 year old boy looked at me and we just walked out.  while walking to our car a lady said did they just ruin your hair too. i laughed and said 'no way"" did not give them a chance. this place has changed so much..i felt like when i left i was walking straight outta compton..so sad.."
"we might have a beauty school drop out on our hands. gloria and lauren are great. but blank (feel bad putting her name) needs additional training in basic hair-cutting techniques. okay. i usually get my hair cut from lauren, who is an amazing hair stylist. but she wasn't working today, so i rolled the dice. i ended up with blank who seemed nice enough. i told her to buzz the sides, trim the top, and blend it all together. that's usually more than enough information. the problem was that she had no idea how to blend. i tried to guide her through the process, but i'm a guy and there's only so much guidance i can give. at one point she got snarky and said in an impatient tone, ""i just did what you asked me to do.""  well, what i ended up with was sides that were nicked up and looked like absolute garbage and were not blended into the top at all. i cut my loses and paid the bill, feeling uncomfortable because i knew my hair looked terrible and that blank did not have the skill to cut it adequately. i walked out and asked my girlfriend (who was waiting in the car) if she thought it looked as bad as i thought. and she gasped and said it looked terrible. so, i went back in and luckily the attractive blonde haired woman named gloria took over and actually trained the other girl as to how to blend the buzzed portion with the scissored portion. within moments, my hair was fixed. so the two i can vouch for are lauren and gloria. blank is sub-par and needs additional training. the other stylists are probably good. i would give more stars because my hair looks fine now, but it's saturday and i didn't need all the nonsense. back to beauty school."
i went in for a haircut and i was greeted by gloria who was with another client and that she'll be right with me. so a few minutes later she comes to me checks me in and i'm in the chair. this was the first time i was at a legit salon. so i showed her 3 pictures and off she went walking me through the whole time she knew i was weary since i always got a buzz cut. i got a tight fade and she cleaned up the top a bit and spiked it and am i freaking happy! she's awesome...highly recommend her. oh plus i was running late and i got out of there with waiting to get in the chair in about 10-15 mins. i am very pleased. she gained my trust and i will be a repeat customer. only problem is...i lost my $10 coupon for my next cut hopefully they honor it. anyway i recommend gloria.
"so i decided to get my hair cut here since my normal lady was unavailable at my usual spot. i tend to get the same cut, short with layers,  but i'm also picky as to how it should be. i must say that i'm not disappointed with my cut. the girl that did mine (i forgot her name but she had red hair and tattoos) was nice. she took her time and did exactly what i wanted. it was also nice that i didn't have to wait very long."
"i like it better than the supercuts up the road because it is less pretentious.  but wash your hair before you come, because there is no hair washing sink here."
"gloria is the best hair stylist i have had work on my hair. my hair is super fine and thin and she manages to make it so even i can style it without much effort. when she does the style it looks fantastic for a couple of days. she's the only reason i go to great clips, if she isn't working, i'll go another day."
"i'm not going to lie. the only reason i came here was because they sent me a coupon for $5 hair cut coupon.  i mean $5 for a haircut?! even if i end up looking like larry, moe or curly, i'm down only $5. i went on a sunday, and it was unexpectedly crowded. i guess because more hair salons are closed on the holiest day of the week. the wait wasn't too bad, maybe half an hour. my hair is short and simple so i just got a 1' fade. it was a really good cut. i was pleasantly surprised that it was. they seem to do hair for all types of clientele so they seem skilled. i noticed that they did try to sell their hair products, especially to women. regular cuts for men and women are $14. i would go back... sooner if they gave me a another $5 coupon."
"this place is just okay. i prefer supercuts down the street. i think it's the decor and colors that make me feel that great clips is for older folks. i came here when it first opened when prices where low and i only return here when i get coupons in the mail. the haircuts seem standard but with less finesse and skill than at supercuts. eh, i would come here in a pinch but i don't prefer it."
this is a great hairstylist! they take care of everyone that comes there and listen to what you want. i even gave them a picture and they were able to duplicate it. they are friendly knowledgeable and helpful. i'd recommend them to everyone.
"i am a female and started going here about 6 months ago.  i get my hair cut every 4 weeks. it's very short and i like it cut a certain way.  i was fortunate that the first girl i had did a great job.  came back a second time and she was gone.  i then had a second girl cut my hair, she was patient and eventually got it the way i like it.  after using her for 3 cuts, she's now gone.  not knowing she was gone, i went there again, expecting to have her and was told she was not in and not sure when she's coming back.  i now had a 3rd girl cut my hair.  she was nervous and unsure, but fortunately she also did a good job.  today, i went in expecting to see my second stylist and there was not a familiar face. i used a women that was very confident and assured about cutting short hair.  she used her fingers, a comb and a buzzer and i still walked out unhappy.  i was informed that there is a constant turnover and the haircuts are timed, so she could only devote a certain amount of time to me.  she bragged that there was no wait today because she was there and she bangs them out (the haircuts).not sure i will return there because i cannot keep explaining to different people all the time how i like my hair.  now i know why they keep notes in the computer, to keep the next person informed.  this particular women refused to even check the notes in the computer.  i hope someone in a higher capacity checks these reviews and can correct the problems."
"i've been bringing my kids here since they were babies bc well, it's cheap and it's a kid cut. but dear lord, after the hack job one of their ""new"" stylists did on both my kids, never again! the turnover rate in this place is unbelievable, but come on now, if you can't cut hair straight, please, just turn in your scissors. like, my kids are getting the simplest of hair cuts. the last time, some new yapper who claimed she used to own a salon, (and now you are working at great clips?), cut both of my kids hair at lightening speed claiming since she's been doing this for so long, she can cut this fast. i was horrified after i did my kids hair the next day, her hair was cut on a complete angle with the left side being about 3 inches longer. even my kid noticed, so it must have been bad. will never return to this or any other chain type hair ""salon"" again."
"i've been going there for some time now. being able to check in on line is a great help to me as i am usually very busy. they keep a record of your last haircut style. i try to get the same stylists every time, like patty or renee, but you can't make appointments , you have to wait for them. there are also some two star stylists in my experience. you have to find who you like. otherwise, they are quick, clean and efficient."
i had a specific request. i gave a picture and everything. now my hair is at least 3 inches shorter than what i wanted. they basically gave me a pixie cut. it's the worst haircut i've ever gotten. i have no idea how i'm going to fix it. the sides are uneven. it's just a huge mess. so now i have short hair and i have no idea what to do with it. i will never come back. going there was a huge mistake.
"i've been using this salon since it opened a few years back. i've always been pretty happy with the cut and service. the only problem is hair stylists leaving, without a word, after you've used them for a couple of years. today i decided to once again pick a new stylist.  i walk in, two girls are both working. i take off my coat, sit and wait. neither girl acknowledges me. usually they greet you and check you in. nothing. okay, so i wait. the first girl who finishes says she needs to use the bathroom so i say i'll wait. that was a lie as she got a cigarette and proceeded to chat with the other stylist.  now i have to wait for the second girl who's giving a woman a trim off the bottom of her long hair. that's it.  but she's talking so much that it's taking longer than it need be. i stand and say, i think i need to come back later. oh honey you need to be somewhere. yes, i'll come back another time. then she proceeds to talk about me to the woman whose hair she's cutting as if i couldn't hear her. hello, i'm standing right here. i hope the doctor who owns this salon reads this and speaks to her employees.  i'll be looking for another salon. way too much competition."
"was there 2-3 times hoping they'll do nice men's haircut, but all they can do is to cut your hair as you're a child going to school. terrible experience, will never go there again"
"i have always dreaded having to get a haircut. i have a very hectic schedule. i never got into the notion of going to a specific place for a specific barber/stylist, and having to be available for them when they are available. this has lead me to jump to various places trying to find a place i'm happy with, and haven't found it until now. i always ran into problems having to tell someone new what i like and don't, even if i went to the establishment before. other places spend more time trying to push the products they sell rather than cut your hair. then there are places that turn a basic cut, into giving you a cup of coffee, try to sell you  a shave and whatever else. all nice and all, but i just want to get in and out. which bring me to great clips - been there now a few times. hours are convenient, the online check in, and seeing how long the wait is awesome. the staff is always friendly, and best of all, they take notes! i walked in for a recent cut, they welcomed me and they started reading notes of how i liked my hair cut done from my previous visit.....wasn't even aware they took the time to write notes from my last visit. this takes one of the biggest pains for me out of getting a haircut. i can go to great clips at any time, and be helped by anyone on their staff..... and they have notes how i like a cut. they have products for sale, but never pushy about it. everything fits the bill, for someone that always dreaded getting haircuts. ....not to mention the bill itself isn't all that much, especially with coupons they send out. ( which like the another reviewer noted, i enjoy ... not so much to save money.... but it allows me to tip more to the staff)"
"very friendly staff!, i love making an online reservation and not needing to sit for long when i go. i have gone to several of the people there and they all gave great clips!  i am a big fan of the coupon i get in the paper or in valpak for a $8.99 haircut which allows me to tip the haircutter very well!  nobody anywhere beats that and my hair grows very fast so i save $$$."
the staff is very friendly and do a fine job. i would like to see them offer free wifi. while waiting i noticed their wifi was locked. providing free wifi would be fantastic.
zero -i received a coupon in the mail and had to use by a date- it was $8.99 and jackie was to cut my hair last night. i always like to find a picture of what i want to show so the haircutter- has a good idea what i want- i went there - and no one was getting any haircut last night- and they did not have a large selection of haircut books- but i found one- a shorter style than what i had- so i dont think jackie even wet the hair- i showed her- she made no comment or advice like if it would look good- etc- i said it was shorter ok- summer is coming- she started to cut- the back- and it felt little short- then the sides were longer with angle- she was finished in like 10 minutes- no gel put in nothing really- she had  a poor attitude- and maybe it was due to my coupon - she just sort of lopped off my hair- i thought it was okay. after looking at it- more- the front pieces - one is longer than the other and fatter- it is noticeble- and where she lopped on one side - its not even blended- ive gone to beauty schools and got better blended cuts = upon close look it does not look finished and professional- i called joy the manager who said she will redo it- and blend on april 9 but i cant wait until then so i will go on saturday- co workers say it looks god but they did not see it up close- it looks good and fresh because i lopped off alot of hair - but the haircut is not good- unblended-by  disgruntled hairdresser- i hope they can fix this- they need an attitude change-mistakes dont deserve tips either-
the staff here is great awesome people to deal with and really felt like i was getting a haircut at home that is how friendly the girls are here i would definitely recommend this s poo t to anyone who wants a great cut and great conversation
came here today my son got a quick haircut no real line there was 2 ladies workinggave my son a faux hawk 12.00 simple and quickthey sold good products and gave my son a lollipop young heavyset latino girl did the cut
"this 5 star rating is based purely from the point of view of roi . the ladies reading this review , if you , like me , find spending upwards of $20 on a haircut an indulgence , and upwards of $30 an exorbitant amount to pull out from your wallet for this particular activity, chances are , that like me , you don't have too many options . well - good news , after much thought and research , i finally found this place which will give you a decent haircut without charging you an arm and a leg . so , are there places that can give you a crazy , totally ott hair cut that make you feel like beyonce for the day ? of course . but then you gotta pay like queen bee or if you are in the mood of saving some money and still getting a pretty good service , go right ahead and give this a go !"
i would highly recommend this hair cutting place! i had called around town for prices and all of them were disappointing. i called asking if they do donation hair cuts(sending your cut hair to company's that make wigs for children with cancer) most places wanted to charge me a nauseating price for me doing a good deed. i called great clips and the women was very respectful and professional and was willing to help me. i walked right in didn't have to wait as i have in previous places. she was very comforting and made the hair cutting experience very calming. i was nervous to cut a large amount off. i will definitely be going back and telling my friends about the amazing experience i had.
"there are slight nuances of my haircut depending on the stylist. i get a simple fade and trim. overall, everyone is welcoming. rarely is there a long line, which is a huge selling point for me."
i needed a quick trim the last time i went. one of the lady's who did my hair was awesome.  i wish i remember her name. everyone is professional an they no their scissors. i will definitely come back if i am in a squeeze for time. the prices are not expensive so i feel take advantage of it.
"this place is a nightmare. i went in for a simple trim, and ended up with botched layers. have to go to a real salon today to have it fixed. you get what you pay for."
"you will find a 2 year old who cuts better hair than the staff at this hair salon.  terrible isn't even a strong enough word to describe the haircuts they give.  i can not tell you how much you will regret ever going to this place.  i once went in there and told them to cut the sides and back of my hair short and keep the top medium.  you know what they did?  took a electric razor and just shave my head.  no scissors on top, just a 2 minute buzz cut and charged me.  maybe i was the only one who had a bad experience, right?  not at all.  my sister went in their to get layers, all they did was trim it in a straight line.  my brother and uncle went in their to get haircuts similar to mine or just a trim, they too went through the 2 minute slaughter that they call a haircut.  the haircut is around $10, but please, spend just 5 more on a hair salon that actually knows what they are doing.  even if you are a person who just likes a buzz cut or a shaved head, the cuts you get from their speedy process is not worth it.  it's as if they are in a competition of who can give the worst possible haircuts, how this place hasn't shut down yet is just mind puzzling.  take my advice, do not go here"
"this place has really good service, wait time is very short and staff is very friendly, the one girl i go there for sindy does my hair really well i prefer her each visit. the pricing is very affordable and its very convenient to check in online before you get there unlike most haircut/hairstyle salons."
"great place to get your haircut! the place is clean and customer service is outstanding! this is my first time here and definitely not the last time when i'm in northern nj. my stylist name was ""anita"". she was very courteous and professional. anita's skill is shown through my result. she asked me what style i would like and also made recommendations. it was a pleasure to visit this place for the first time! i do recommend it to all... also ""great clips"" offered a free haircut on this nov. 2016 veterans day to all veterans past and present! i salute you ""great clips""!"
"if you want a $15 haircut, you're gonna get a $15 haircut. it's hit or miss with this place. sometimes they get it right and sometimes they screw it up. i'm done with the russian roulette. perhaps it's my fault for not having a dedicated stylist i go to. i just wait for whoever is available. i'll be taking my business elsewhere.online check in is pretty cool"
i have gone here quite a few times and it's not very good. the only reason why i even kept going was strictly out of convenience. my boys are young so they arent too picky. the prices are cheap but you get what you pay for! every time i went here they messed up my sons hairline. i've tried every single employee they've had in the past few years and not one was able to do the shape up even and straight. seriously now... is it too hard to ask for a straight line? i told them every time to make their side burns pointy but they always cut them off. how irritating! i have found a barber for my boys that does an amazing job now. its $14 per child but well worth it! i've also had my hair cut here and they did aan okay job. nothing to rave about. it was $12 so that made me happy lol. this place does a much better job on females than males. not one of these ladies was able to shape up a hairline!! not one. i will not be returning here.
"a very nice hair salon where you can get a good haircut at a very good price. the staff is very friendly and accommodating. they recognize and greet regular customers. there are discounts available, including an $11 haircut for seniors."
"good, solid place to get a haircut. very friendly management and staff that does a good job for each and every client. haircuts are affordable as is, but be on the lookout for frequent coupons on the back of shop rite receipts for added value."
"the few times ive been there, (same haircutter) been totally disappointed, she really had no clue how to give a good haircut, or what she is even doing. trims one sideburn only, leaves patches of hair uncut, seems to be in a rush. what is up with that? and why would a place keep a loser like that employed there?  if you care about what your hair looks like after its cut, find another place!"
"destroyed my hair .. i asked for a simply low fade and trim on top and i got an uneven fohawlk .. if you do go, don't let jennifer cut your hair"
i was out getting my nails done when i heard of a great deal on hair cuts. i was told about a 7.99 hair cut so i had to go and find out. i went into this location and had a shampoo and cut. nielsa assisted me and was very friendly. i went in for a basic trim but nielsa talked me into some long layers and i am very happy with the result. i am pretty sure that i will be back every month for a trim. the wait was near zero. the store is clean and fresh looking.
"from out of town i stopped here to get my 11 year old sons hair cut first thing on a sunday. although they seemed very nice, the lady who checked us in acted like she knew his hair cut. mind you, they have a computer and when entering a number in the system, it should pull up the clients profile, clearly this time it didn't but she acted like it did. i confirmed his name and after watching her butcher his hair, it was clear she had no clue about how he wanted it and probably no clue on how to cut hair. i went over to the computer screen to confirm she had his name and my number correct. being out of town, she had my number correct but had my sons name as ""brain"" instead of his actual name brayden. i asked her several times to stop and she kept cutting and cutting and then when it came time to clean up his neck and ears she was cutting into his skin, and when he said ""ouch"" she said ""why you say ouch?"". i had to have her stop completely as his neck was bright red with razor marks and he was in tears. she tried to charge us at the end which was the last thing on my mind, until another stylist stepped in and said, ""we can't charge him"". i hope management looks into this matter and takes a better look at their staffs abilities."
fran cut my hair and she did a very good job. you can tell she loves hair by her knowledge of all things hair. highly recommend her to anyone and would definitely get a hair cut with her again.
"staff was always complaining. they don't take any time to do a decent job. they pay attention to you if you are a regular. if not, good luck with getting a decent haircut. please note: the asian chick in her late 40's is a airhead & the worst of the bunch. ...good luck!!"
i usually come here all the time but this time another worker worked here and her name is jeannine. not only did she have attitude but she was laughing at me because i asked a question. totally unnecessary and that was not needed at all. i will not be getting a haircut when she's around
"i've been going to barber shops for over 15 years but today i found myself in a desperate situation so i figured i'd give this place a shot based on other yelp reviews.  i'll admit i was nervous about getting my haircut here but carol was really nice, very friendly and gave me a great haircut...better than what i had been getting to be completely honest.  she'll be getting my business again."
"i've been to this place 3 times expecting to get a decent haircut....always end up walking out dissatisfied. the stylists there are only good to you if they know you very very well. anything other than that, you'll walk out with a patchy haircut........last time i was there, i can hear the lady getting annoyed every time she sees a customer walk in. i say she should call it a day and leave if she cant take anymore customers. it was on a sunday at 1pm. the result was she decided  to rush through my haircut and i ended up with a bad haircut. that is when i decided that i'll try my luck somewhere else....take my advice and take you business somewhere else."
it's shark week. my kid loves sharks and josefina gave him a great sharkhawk. he loves it and so does my wife!
"i have taken my son here for hair cuts since he was 11 months old. every single time he has gotten his hair cut, he has cried. he is a toddler. he doesn't like his head held and he doesn't like sitting still. but, guess what? we've always survived. i took him in today for a quick cut. after waiting 40 minutes, i told the lady cutting his hair that he would sit on my lap ( like normal) and that he normally does cry but that's why i brought a pacifier, cartoons, and snacks. then, she changed her attitude.she told me she will immediately stop cutting his hair if he cries or if another customer says something about said crying. um what? i am also a paying customer, so why shouldn't i get service as well? do we kick babies off of planes because they cry? nope, we deal. do we kick toddlers out of restaurants because they make messes? nope, we deal.if you don't want to cut a toddler's hair because they will cry, then don't say you're a family establishment and have prices just for toddlers. i immediately left and the lady gave me dirty looks without offering a solution. i'm not going to risk getting half of a hair cut just in case my kid starts crying and annoys the two other customers that were in there. hey stylist: you work at great clips; if you want to discriminate, then maybe work somewhere better.there's a reason this place has low starts--crappy service and crappy stylists."
great service jelen was very patient with my daughter and took her time to give her a great haircut!
"i'm giving this 3 stars but should be 2.5 at most. this place gets the job done when you need a quick little touch up and clean up. nothing fancy. they are barely ok hairdressers. they get you in and out asap and looking decent and presentable when you need it in a pinch. this is why i go there often. and because it's very close to home. you get your haircut there at your own risk. either way, they are fairly nice ppl that work there."
"we had a great experience at great clips! our 8-year-old chopped off her hair past shoulder length into a pixie cut. they do excellent quality work for low prices- she got her hair cut with a super deluxe treatment (spray, gel, etc.) for only $12 for a child! the lady who cut her hair seemed to truly care that she did a good job and smiled each time our 8-year-old did. the job was quick and lasted less than  the expected time they told us of 40 minutes,  so that was a pleasant surprise. not only are the hair cuts cheap, but the great clips ""menu"" listed several other services, including shampoo, etc. all for roughly $15 or more, depending on the service. great clips has the quality of any hair salon or barbershop with prices that can't be beat, and we certainly enjoyed our experience at this branch- we tipped $10, almost doubling the cost of the cut!"
i go every two weeks and i get great service.  it's best if you have an idea about your preferred length and ask to cut a little bit if you're unsure.  as my old barber used to say: i can take it off but i can't put it back on.  i check in online and usually don't wait.
"for some reason, the people here do not listen to what i want. they act like they are trying to rush you through and as if they do not want to cut my hair. 7min to cut my hair and got the exact opposite of what i asked for. had the same experience now 4 of 5 times i have gone here."
"i've had some pretty bad experiences at this location but nothing tops last night. i was in a pinch and had to get a haircut for the new job i'm beginning. i specified low fade knowing my hair sticks up and doesn't look professional if it is to high. the lady, i think josefina bruno, proceeds to start off low and then buzzes the entire side part out of my hair. if i had wanted the hipster style without a side part,  i would have asked for it! i'm trying to look professional and she completely ruined that chance for me. i have never grabbed the sheers out of the barbers hand regardless of how bad the cut was,  but this lady kept on creeping up on the sides and her fade was completely disheveled looking, so i grabbed her sheers to stop her from cutting anymore. the manager came and took over my cut to fix it,  and even admitted that whatever she did was the best she could do to not make my hair look weird. she even suggested that i not do my hair as i've been doing because it won't look good for now. but after all of this,  i had to still pay for this horrible haircut and will be able to get a free haircut only next time if that manager is there? are you freaking kidding me? what the hell makes you believe i want to ever step foot in this location or any great clips ever again? as i said,  i'm not someone to ever complain and for me to write this is a big deal. i'm still seething from how horrendous the experience was, and this is about 12 hours later. something needs to be done! people should stop going here not let these awful people ruin anyone else's hair!"
"i've had one good experience and one bad. it depends on who cuts your hair. the last time i went, the ""stylist"" cut my shoulder length hair in just 3 minutes. since it was damp i couldn't quite tell if she got it right. she said it would cost me extra to dry it. two months ago, another stylist spent a good 15 minutes cutting my hair and lightly styled it with a blow dryer so that i could actually see the cut - and all for the same price. she made an effort. clearly the other stylist did not care about customer satisfaction which is the biggest issue with this place. in fact she was annoyed to know that another stylist had lightly blow dried my hair at no extra cost."
"so, i get sucked in by the $2.99 grand opening special and planned to get a trim since i couldn't make it to my regular stylist.  parking is ample but poorly designed for this new complex ... an accident waiting to happen.  just drive slowly and avoid the over-eager parkers and watch the turns (narrow lanes and bad visibility).great clips is an a la carte shop.  cuts are normally $14, shampoos another $4.  not sure if the styling is extra (i.e, blow dry) but regular styling was listed at $20.  i arrived at the salon and there was only one woman and her son in the waiting area.  great!  i should be second on the list.  nope, there were five other names in front of me.  no big deal ... so i'll wait.  the receptionist called the next person on the list via phone and waited 15 minutes for her party of four to get in.  irked that there isn't a first come, first served policy, i still waited patiently for my $3 trim.  while i waited, i saw several women and children get their hair cut.  after seeing their results, i got a little scared and debated whether i was about to make a big mistake.  layers and lengths looked uneven and i saw the woman who was in front of me point out several points of concern on her new hair cut to the stylist.  then she had the stylist fix her son's hair (he had gotten it cut the day before).  taking that as my cue, i headed for the door.  a bargain is a bargain but a bad hair cut is 3 months.i think this place is great for kids and people who may want non complicated hair styles.  but i'm not sure if i will take a chance on this place."
beware stay away ! they chopped my hair !! the woman did not know how to use scissors. i did not pay them and screamed for what they had done to my beautiful hair. 0 stars
not that bad. it depends on the person that does cutting.  i had some good experiences and i had a couple of really bad once. i would give them another try.
"worst haircut ever. its so uneven i have to now go get it fixed somewhere else. whatever you do, don't let sun cut your hair. i said i just wanted a trim and she totally butchered me. do yourself a favor and spend the extra $ and go somewhere else!"
"ok i have to say that i went there with extremely low expectations due to all the negative reviews.  however i really needed a trim and i had spare time after my wax at european wax right next door.  on a saturday morning at 9:15am there was no wait.  i was greeted quickly by the next available stylist, katelynn.  she asked me what i needed done then we proceeded to get a wash.  the wash was just okay, but that could just be me since i am used to the ones in chinatown where they really scrub with their nails and give me a massage afterwards.  anyways, i digress... once i got into the chair, the stylist was nice enough to advise that everything is a la carte so i don't get surprised by the bill in the end.  i appreciated that as some salons hit you with a big tab afterwards with no warning.  katelynn was very careful and made sure to ask me how much to take off since i am growing out my hair and hate short bangs.  the blowout was nice too but i think it was a bit pricey since i have gotten better ones in the city for much cheaper (like $15 cheap!!). ultimately i am happy with my last minute decision to walk in despite the reviews.  it's just a matter a luck with great clips depending on who you get paired with.  final bill $55 ($20 for wash and cut plus $35 for blowout)."
"despite the reviews i decided to stop by on a monday evening for a quick trim for me and my 6 year old girl, and gotta say it was quick and pleasant , place was clean amanda was super nice and patient with my daughter , they used biolage products to wash our hair, i didnt style it so i'm not sure how it is as far as blow drying but for a basic wash and cut i was pleasantly surprised!"
"well, gotta say, after not getting the best haircut in the world on my first visit, i went back, and katrina, the manager, assured me that it would be corrected. she cut it exactly the way i liked it and really knew what she was doing. she took care of me, even staying later than normal, as i came in late. she makes a great manager and i'm sure this great clips will be successful. the other girl that was working that night that cut my son's hair did a great job as well.kudos to them for reversing my initial decision! and thanks so much to karen as well! ;-)"
"stay away!!!! i took my 2,5 yr old son and crystal chopped his hair so bad that i had to take him somewhere else to get it fixed. crystal, the stylist was so miserable from the start and has a major attitude problem. she is so unfriendly and has no idea how to cut a boy's hair. she cut my son's hair crooked and gave me a huge attitude when i kindly asked her to fix it. she then cut it even worse. i will never go there again!!!!!!!"
nobody speaks english therefore i couldn't get across what i wanted. literally just had my sides done then went somewhere else for top because she used a 1 clip instead of a 3. i should have checked out yelp!
"pretty bad ....messed up my son's hair and had to fix it at home.  i did call and ask if they cut hair for 18 month olds....they said yes.  the woman that cut my son's hair kept on saying he's moving too much and she's afraid to cut...well, if they had experience then they would know.  you get what you pay for....going back to pumpkin and bean...expensive but they know how to handle yound kids."
"awful service. nobody even acknowledged me as i stood at the desk waiting to be checked in. so i stood there awkwardly for 2-3 mins before someone told me to have a seat. i was only there for a trim, but i was surprised the woman cut my hair without wetting it at all. if you're looking for an inexpensive haircut, try supercuts in hoboken."
"quality hair cut from friendly stylist.  not a high end salon and not priced like one.  in cut and out.  much better than the city ave location which is more culturally diverse.   need a quick cut, this is the place in drexel hill."
this is one branch of a big chain. the good news is-* clean and neat* competitive pricing* decent hours* in and out relatively quickly with no appointmentthe bad news is it can be difficult to get the same person each time.  if that's important to you another alternative may be your best choice.
"3 strikes and they're out.  there are plenty of other local places that are inexpensive that will give you a good cut.  i've tried them as well as others i know, and it's not worth having them ruin your hair then you have  to grow your hair out just to have another stylist fix your cut.  skip, skip skip!"
"i bring my son here for his haircuts and the stylists consistently do a great job. they maintain a computerized record of the clippers that were previously used, so there is no guesswork in trying to figure out what made the last haircut so great. the salon is tastefully decorated and i've never had to wait more than about 20 minutes - usually there is no wait at all early on a saturday morning or weekday evenings. you can also use the computer check in service to reduce your wait, but i haven't found the need. they have lolipops for the kids after a job well done. high"
i've been here quite  a few times and never had a bad experience.  everyone here is so pleasant and the store is clean as can be.   $13 haircut - yes please!  keep up the good work!
"what a rude, snotty staff....even laughing and saying they don't want to work on you to their other co-worker like you're not standing right there in front of them when we're donating for locks of love. it's not like anyone was even in the shop when we came in. wow...thanks katie. i don't know why we just didn't leave if it weren't to donate the hair. a tip shouldn't have even been given to the other co-worker who seemed to tolerate us until she was given the more than deserved tip for her attitude. what a disappointing visit to philly, especially when we were out to do a good deed."
"decent and cheap haircuts in the newtown square, you pay 12-14$ as a child or man, women pay more. my goto place around work"
"disgusting-don't ever go here. dirty is an understatement. stylists will upcharge you and sneak it on your receipt- that's what they did to me. nickel and dime, bait and switch to a loyal customer. after confronting their tactics they told me, ""we don't care if you ever come back, your dad, too. you can go to hair cuttery and look like an idiot when they screw up your hair."" this particular franchise does not care about their customers whatsoever. they'll likely be out of business very soon treating people in this manner. some small businesses truly deserve our money...this one does not. shameful. infinite negative stars.one year after i wrote this review and i contacted great clips corporate and received not even a return call, the owner ""joe g."" comments on all of the bad reviews with a copy/paste apology. it's laughable and demonstrates exactly the issue with great clips. i wouldn't return even if it was free haircuts for life. are you even real ""joe g""? and if you are the owner, a blanket copy/paste apology to negative reviews is a pitiful attempt at saving face on social media that will not counter the scarred reputation of this store or bring back past loyal customers. a year later...smh."
"i showed her a picture, i asked her to not take anything off the length. she totally ignored me and cut it so short i could cry. i'll never go back again!!!!"
i took my mom for her hair cut.  she is 86 most certainly a senior.  they have a senior cut for $12.00.  it cost her $35.00 because she wanted her hair dry before she left.  she did not get her hair washed either.  but we were told the $12 was a cut only.  who goes out of a hair salon with wet hair. really $24 to have your hair washed and dried is ridiculous and nobody would go into the cold with wet hair.  a ridiculous ploy to pull seniors or anybody for that matter.  not to mention they did not seem professional. never will we return.
consistent haircut every time with fast service.
"this shop is terrific!  larissa and irene are very good.  haircut is efficient, personal, and always what i want.  the haircut is so good that it is literally wash and go at home - very good styling."
"the staff was pretty unfriendly, which is always weird because you expect the person cutting your hair to converse at least a little. the haircut was quick and to the point, just not friendly."
"so normally i like this place for a quick cut for my oldest. i showed them a picture of what he wanted. something like that.  she says "" yeah i can do that but the edging up there? that's not going to happen. i can do the rest but that i cannot"". ok i understand you don't know how to do that because it's a ""barber"" thing. but to say ""that's not going to happen"". learn how to talk to customers. that's not the way it's done. you say that you cannot do that it's more detailed than you can do and maybe a barber would be best. but ""that's not going to happen"" just made me want to deck her. will not be coming back for a quick fix. i'll make the appointment at the regular and just wait it out.  that just brought the 4 star to a 2."
"check in on line, then wait again in shop. store is a hot mess and the associated was not nice. waste of time."
i checked in online and got serviced right away when i arrived.  usually when i get a haircut it takes about 45 minutes start to finish.  i was here for 20 minutes tops.  they rush through and don't take their time to get to know what you want.  i feel like there are parts of my hair that didn't even get cut.  there are plenty of other places in the area that are in the same price range and are better.
"i was a walk in on a busy saturday and was prepared to wait forever.  instead of forever, it was more like 10 minutes, which was nice.  carina did my hair and she did a really great job.  i went in there and told her that i wanted it short with an angle, and she went above and beyond making sure i looked good.  she asked me several times if i liked what she was doing and made sure that i was comfortable.  really excellent job for only $13.  i will definitely be back in the future!"
"cynthia.....my wife has been thrilled with the care and the time that cynthia spends with her. i tried telling her for years that you don't have to spend $65 to get a good cut and now she's a big fan. she cuts mine as well; although there's a lot less to cut, but spends time with mine as well"
"the good: - adult hair cuts are $15. - wait time are short, plus you can make a reservation ahead of time online. - easy to get it & plenty of parking. - clean location & friendly staff. the bad: - the skill level is not totally there. i left my most recent haircut unhappy as the hair dresser did not follow my request and completely missed strands of hair. unfortunately the good does not outweigh the bad here & ill be finding somewhere else for my next hair cut."
"not a good experience.  i checked in online and when i arrived told the woman at desk i wanted hair cut, blow dry, and style.  it seems she was annoyed i wanted "" the works"" as she told another customer why there was going to be a wait. if this is a problem then the service should not be offered.  will not be going back there."
r u serious ...$14 for kid hair (7 yrs old) cut....wow! they didn't even do a great job! the faded isn't right it goes up and down like a zig zag.
"after two calls to corporate headquarters with promises that the owner would call me to discuss, a negative review on yelp, and a complaint to the bbb, i finally received a phone call today from a manager stating that they would refund the $25.00 they charged for my daughter to get her hair washed and blown dry. they want me to come back in on wednesday to receive the refund. when i questioned why my sons were charged adult prices, they informed me that those prices reflect 10 and under. my one son is 10, and i pointed that out. the manager told me i had paid that price for him before after looking back at our records. they will not refund the money for charging him as an adult. so---the fact that they've been scamming me for a while makes it okay, i guess? they also said coupons would be sent in the mail. honestly, they can keep them. it's a shame. my family has been patronizing this place for years. there was a much better way to handle this and it started with the manager working with me the night i was upset that my daughter's haircut was $44.00 without any warning. avoid this place at all costs."
"not that it is that difficult to cut my balding hair, but for some reason i am always happy when i walk out of great clips. the stylists are always very friendly and try to make conversation with you.  they only charge 15 for a cut and certain times you can go in and get it for less.i did not make an appointment or check in online but i have never had to wait for more than five minutes.  this time was no exception.  the place always seems clean and organized.  i have to other places where they leave the hair on the floor between cuts and the stylists is always rummaging around in her draw looking for a clipper attachment or something.bottom line, quick, reasonably priced, friendly, clean, and they make me look good, what's not to like?"
"what a great place. the staff was friendly and upbeat. online check-in got me in and out really quickly. the area is great too, close to restaurants , other businesses and a grocery store. the shop was quick and convenient and great quality. i will certainly be back."
"better haircut in this area.  adrienne did my hair cut, she was good.  they charge $15 for adult hair cut."
"they do an online check in which i don't get, but, also so walk inns. they don't do color, but, do cuts and the basics. i'm not sure why i ever allowed anyone but tiffany to touch my hair, she is the absolute best stylist in the area! if you're looking for a great haircut, new style....someone who is approachable, funny, sweeeeeeet, and a great stylist see tiffany."
"horrible !!! i'm giving one star because i have got haircut from this place before also and they were good, otherwise the last experience with one of the hair stylist deserves zero star and was the worst ever. i'll just suggest them to stick with basics: be nice to people, and don't take customers at the 8th hour if you don't want to serve them. some hair stylist working at this place neither have skills nor experience with hair cutting, they r just pass timers..issued in public interest:- do not go to this place on thursday evening."
cheap decent hair cuts. been coming here for years with my son. everyone has always been friendly.
"i've been a great clips customer for 5 years at the voorhees shop; this was my third visit to the marlton crossing shop. never again!  my son flew in from l.a. on an all-night flight to attend a friend's wedding.  we took him to great clips for a trim which should have taken no more than 5 minutes. we called ahead to make sure the shop was open, then we went right over from the airport. it was about 8:20 on saturday morning when we entered the shop. the stylist was with a customer (no one else was waiting).  she asked if we checked-in online and we told her we did not. she told us that, nonetheless, we would be next and our wait would be 10-15 minutes.  although my son was very tired, we felt 10-15 minutes was reasonable, so we sat down to wait.  about 25 minutes later a man walked in, said he checked in online, and was then taken before us. how can an online check-in trump an in-person check-in?  my wife objected because we had been waiting patiently in excess of our estimated wait time; however the stylist just turned her back on us as she escorted the online customer to a chair. wonderful customer service, right?  if this is great clip's policy, then conceivably we could wait all day as people keep checking in online and we keep getting bumped. such a policy is also discriminatory toward the elderly, many of whom do not have or use a computer. it's time to say goodbye to great clips."
"worst haircut i ever got from one of the stylists here. i have got haircuts from this location earlier, and they have been good. this review just reflects the one experience that i had."
"although the staff was very friendly - i will never be going back to this place.  after cutting five inches off about half of my daughter's hair - i see the stylist combing thru the back of her head.  i walk over to ask if there is a problem and she tells me there is lice.  another stylist comes over to -confirm.  after i freak out - first about the lice and then about them leaving her hair like that - they took her in the back and did a hatchet job cutting the other half.  they tried to sell me their $42 kit to get rid of lice but we left and got it at cvs for half that amount.  after four hours of treatment and combing thru her hair piece by piece - we come to find out that it was actually just sand!  we had been at the beach earlier in the day.  in my panic - i did not mention that at the salon but i would think they should be able to tell the difference between lice and sand.  and if they bothered to shampoo the client before cutting the hair - it would not have been a problem but apparently they just wet the hair.   they did not charge me for the ""haircut"" but i wasted $20 and four hours of time - not to mention having my daughter so upset!   i also now have to get her hair cut again to fix the unevenness.  total customer service fail.  i am livid!"
"i'm not sure if new people were hired but this place has gotten a little better. got the haircut i asked for, quick and easy.a few mistakes here and there but they don't question and they're glad to fix it!if you want a inexpensive and quick haircut, go here.but don't expect it to be perfect!"
very disappointed with this place.my son always ask for this barber gene that cuts his hair multiple times in this place.we went because we knew he would be there.checked in and waited 10minutes for this specific barber since he was cutting someone's hair and then he was done.we were the only one waiting then a guy came in and was asked if he registered online and he said yes.he took him right away and we ended up telling them to cancel us because we asked specifically for gene.why did the other guy go first instead of my son?
terrible. checked in online and it said 0 wait time. got there about 5 minutes later and i was somehow 7th in the queue with a 35 minute wait time. they also took someone lower on the queue ahead of me. someone even said something and they still took him ahead of his place in the queue. the stylist i had didn't listen to me at all and cut layers into my hair despite me saying not to. and cut more off than i asked for. you get what you pay for i guess but that wasn't even worth $16. for that experience they should have paid me $16.
just got vincenzo's first hair cut at great clips in springfield!! great experience!! thank you so much to our wonderful hair dresser danielle!!
"worst experience ever! went here to get my daughter's haircut. we just moved to the area. the lady was so rude told my husband she would just cut my daughter's hair all off. my daughter is a 8 year old, who does get tangles easily. she had a few knots in her hair but nothing a little brushing would not have taken care of. this lady made my daughter cry and said some really hurtful things. my husband did not get her name unfortunately, but it happened today january 2. i would never suggest anyone go here unless you like being insulted. wish i could give zero stars. went to regis salon at springfield mall immediately afterwards, my daughter got a great cut and was treated wonderfully there."
they butchered my son. my 11 year old son has the easiest hair ever. seriously i have 3 kids and this one is a no-brainer which is why i allow my husband to take him to great clips. yes that's a loaded statement but all he needs is a buzz. seriously. we have never had a problem getting him a decent buzz cut. well.... not only did they use the wrong setting (a 1 vs a 2) but the neck line was completely crooked and they completely shaved bald his forehead line which again was crooked right across the front of his head. it is the craziest thing i ever saw. my son was in tears before he even left great clips and no one said anything (yes including my husband who paid and tipped for this atrocity.) i was heartbroken for my son when he returned. i have photos but will not post them in public. if anyone from great clips wanted to contact me i would be happy to share with you directly. i'm appalled at the horrible cut. i can't imagine the person who did this was even a licensed professional. luckily his hair grows fast and he is easy to forget. we will head to a seasoned professional stylist next time and pay more for a cut. i would think twice before entrusting your hair to anyone at a great clips especially this one in springfield.
"i've been here a few times and, overall, haven't had the best experiences. the real reason why i get my hair cut here is because it's close by - not for any specific stylist.frankly, all i've ever seen when i walk in here is semi-depressed looking people. no, not the customers, the workers. that's with the exception of only one woman which of whom i don't know the name of that is very bubbly, seems nice, and actually knows what she's doing. on top of that, they don't have any one person manning the register so people sometimes fight over who was waiting longer since no one was able to put anyone in the system for their waiting iist.i must say, though, that i've had a few stylists who have made my hair exactly how i wanted. but that shouldn't be as hard as they make it for a simple pixie cut."
if you want a nice haircut avoid this place at all costs. it seems like the common theme amongst all these reviews is they don't listen or care. i've gone to this place the last few haircuts and i can't do it anymore. they're very inconsistent. i get the same haircut every time and they always find a way to screw it up. latanya the lady that cut my hair this time finished my hair in less than two minutes just so she could chat with other coworkers. now my hair is very uneven and i'm embarrassed to go to work.
"customer service wasn't great, stylist spoke more to others then me. my hair was not  washed just sprayed with a spray bottle. my cut was ok but no offer to dry my hair. i left with my hair feeling dirtier then when i went in."
"my son went to great clips in springfield, pa, as he usually does, but this time he was very dissatisfied due to the butchering he received from the stylist.  we told him that if he was going to be butchered like that he was better off going to roy tweedy's ( which is a real butcher shop). i'm not sure if it was because he was a teenager, or for the fact that he use the coupon that was mailed to us, but either way they did a horrible job, and it costs more to fix his hair the way it should have been done in the first place. my husband called the salon upon my sons return, to see if we could resolve the situation, but of course we never received a response. no call back from any manager, or any apologies whatsoever. i would highly advise that no one go to great clips in springfield until they get their act together! as for us, we are a large family and we go there a lot, but will never step foot in that place again!"
"this is a chain, but a good place for a haircut. the people are always very friendly and talkative, and the haircuts are good, at least for easy hair like mine.they ask for your phone number, but don't worry- they won't call you, they just save any information about how to cut your hair and associate it with the number. that way, the next time you come in you don't have to explain what you want! for someone who lacks hair vocabulary, it's a big help.the only problem is that they will brush your neck with a lot of baby powder without asking you- you must let them know if you don't want that much.walking there from swarthmore is not the most pleasant, as you have to cross baltimore pike."
"needed to get my hair did- i live in the area and have stayed away from this place since you have to pay for a wash and a cut and a blow dry. but if i'm going to pay $30 somewhere else- why not!they do not offer color or other specialties- only cuts. i went friday night, 5pm and was in and out. i have had some scalp issues so sahara used tea tree shampoo and conditioner and spent some extra time working it in- it felt awesome.i wasn't expecting miracles since it's a walk-in salon but she gave be a good text-book layered hair cut. she was pleasant to talk with and didn't talk too much.nice work!"
"used to be typical now terrible. seriously twice i've gotten cuts by trainees who really are not experienced. one didn't even get how to blend/fade and i have the worlds thickest easiest hair to cut. i had to have her buzz it all off so i didn't look like a damn crooked rooster. after complaining to corporate, come to find out this is a franchise and they flat out don't care. fortunately chain chop shops are a dime a dozen.adding a point because another great clips location saw how messed up the cut was and fixed/recut for a huge discount."
they close 10 minutes after i got there and told me they're not accepting any more clients. i can get a crappy haircut anywhere but i choose you because you're close.
"i thought this great clips used to be really great. but, tonight's customer service was so horrible that i actually decided to install yelp app and give review so that folks will expect what kind of service they are getting. i would like to request the management team to start looking into their employees attitudes. not all of them are bad. some are really good actually. but, it's usually one that creates seriously disgusting customer experience. one bad experience might overshadow the past good experiences. i intend to visit this facility in coming days. i hope the management team takes my review seriously and i hope get to better quality services.p.s: tonight's haircut was so horrible that i could have done better job myself. i am never letting the same hairstylist touch my hair again."
"twice now, my husband has come here and the stylist has messed up to the point of just giving him a shaved head because there was a lack of communication or knowledge, i am not sure, on the stylist part. i then foolishly thought this place might be better for my children and my son now has uneven hair and my daughters hair just hangs with no style or shape. very disappointed, we will not be going back."
"my husband went to get a haircut yesterday, saturday, and was greeted by a pleasant and professional young african american woman. (the only reason i'm mentioning that is he forgot to get her name.)we were both so pleased with his haircut  and she now has a permanent client. we can't speak for the other stylists, but she did a great job. my husband's hair is very fine, and the way she cut it was perfect."
"i went to get a haircut on sunday, march 25th. the posted hours say that they close at 5pm. i tried to use the app so they knew i was on the way, but could not since it was within the last half hour of the store being open. i drove over and arrived at 4:42. and was promptly told they were not taking any more customers. there were no customers waiting and no customers being serviced. if i had arrived at 2 or 3 minutes before closing, i might understand. but it normally only takes about 15 minutes to cut my hair. needless to say, if i hadn't pre-paid for a card for the year, i would not be going back. i would like to know if the owner has other stores in the area where i could use the pre-paid card so i don't have to go back. i never had any problems for the 5 years i was using the store in ridley township, but apparently there is a dramatic change in professionalism when you move just 8 miles away."
decent haircut for a reasonable price. the quality of the haircut greatly depends on the stylist you get.
"was really in need of a good haircut the other day so i stopped in this great clips.  my hair was in terrible shape after having been butchered by a woman from another hair place over 6 months ago, and then being ""trimmed"" here and there by my mom and two daughters.  had a wash and cut for $16 plus a tip which wasn't bad at all.  dee did a great job, and thanks to her, i feel so much better now!"
"i went to great clips after my stylist at another salon left.  i brought two pictures to give the stylist an idea of what i wanted.  she asked me some questions, restated what she thought i wanted to make sure she understood, and gave me a fabulous cut! it's so rare to find someone that actually listens! the cut was exactly what i wanted.  it was $12, plus tip.  ive paid $60 or more at local salons and wasn't nearly as happy as i am with this cut.  this particular stylist is no longer there, but they all seem excellent.  women are constantly complimenting me on  my hair and asking me where i go.  they are shocked when i tell them."
"my boyfriend went in for a haircut today and from the second the girl started we both knew she had no idea what she was doing. she was super young and looked completely lost. the haircut was patchy and just looked all around awful. the manager i guess had to to fix it, and still didn't do much. would definitely not recommended this place."
they do a fine job. it's quick. the ladies are always nice. it's inexpensive. i do recommended checking in online or on the app ahead of time; otherwise you could wait a long time.
"you get what you pay for. i was the youngest guy inside. all seniors. well, the clip was nice. no razor neck shave like barbers do. people were friendly and nice."
"let me start off by saying i've been going here for about 5 + years. i went in to get it clean up. and easy bob with a tapered underneath. nothing hard. nothing fancy. while i was waiting i even found a picture of the length and the taper that i wanted. so i show ""rosemary"", get in her chair and it just goes downhill... she starts to cut, walks away to talk to another stylist, comes back and continues. not long after i asked for a mirror. i had told her due to a cervical spinal surgery last may i could not feel the back of my head. when i look in the mirror i knew i was going to have a terrible panic attack (i do suffer from anxiety). she had cut my hair so short up the back she could have used clippers. my hair is in the shape of a horseshoe! the back is completely butchered up to the top of my head and she left long sides so from the front it looks like a super duper short bob! after having cervical spinal surgery last year they had to cut open the back of my head. there is no way i would get a haircut this short to highlight a scar that runs into my head like that. i was so upset i begged my husband to cancel our trip down the shore. it was only two nights but he had surprised me with a"" you deserve this trip baby, it's been a hard recovery for you"". being on disability, i cannot afford to cancel a trip like this. i reached out to corporate great clips who put me in touch with someone who works with the owner. i told him what happened, i showed them pictures, and all i want is to be refunded for my trip. not much to ask right? do you think that's happened? the moral of my story here is do not go here! and if you are, if you are that desperate, do not let rosemary near your head! great clips has enough customers and they can afford to lose 1 after 8 years. they can afford lose you too!!!"
jacqueline gave my son a huge bold spot and didn't have the decency of telling us it happened. we noticed when we got home. very unprofessional for not reporting her mistake and apologizing for it. she should not be cutting anybody's hair.
a great haircut doesn't have to have a big price tag.  i've visited this great clips on several occasions and have yet to be disappointed.  worth driving to this location because the girls here know what they are doing.  never too long a wait and check in a available online is an added plus.
i feel bad because the staff here is always so nice but the past few times i was very specific about how i wanted my kids hair cut and either my requests were just ignored or the skill level isn't there. it was always hit or miss but too many misses for me lately. not going back again.
great value where you can get haircut very affordably if you're not looking for frills i highly recommend it. i have been here 4 times and they always do exactly as i request. for an additional affordable fee they will wash your hair - to save money they suggest going with freshly washed hair. online check in saves time they're very friendly clean and professional here.
love this place. i feel like family every time i am there. and they make me look like a million bucks :)
"they listen to your needslook, they talk to you if you want to be talked to, or they just cut your hair. but, they ask you what you want.they also always suggest styles, cuts, . products for your hair and scalp.they are helpful and good at what they do. i've never had a bad experience. i drove from philadelphia just to go to this location."
"i'm giving this place 1 star, i went there a year ago and loved my hair cut. i went there 2 weeks ago and was mortified with how short she cut it after telling a specific length to cut it, i just now straightened my hair to try getting used to it and she butchered my hair. she was rushing to get out by 4, my whole wash and hair cut took about 20 minutes, having long, thick, curly hair it should've taken longer. a year ago i would've recommended this place to everyone, after the experience i just had.... absolutely not."
"my first time here, after recently moving to the neighborhood.  i waited about 2 minutes to get in , and michelle gave me a great haircut, with very confident hands !!  what more could you ask for ? !"
"i walked in about 15 minutes before closing in hopes of getting my son a quick trim. all three of the hair dressers turned to look at my family but said nothing. an extra rude glance was given by the other blonde haired woman in the first booth. after awkwardly waiting for a few minutes we decided to leave. again, on our way out the door the older blonde woman gave another rude look. i understand it was near closing time but if you don't want costumers, instead of making us feel like were not wanted please just lock the door."
"never a long wait.  i recommend lindsey. she is attentive, child-friendly and sociable unlike the other cryptkeepers that work there.  the tan, feathered,  farah wannabe is one to avoid.  i hate that they don't take phone appointments. otherwise, great place."
"i've been using this great clips for about 2 years. i always get great service. i understand the level of customer service that needs to be given with the public but the girls there go above and beyond. only complaints i have are with great clips itself. it's hard for someone to stop cutting hair and then jump back and forth and answer phones and service the walk ins and still go back to cut hair! hire a desk girl already! let the stylists focus on the customer. and any other customer reading this... understand these ladies are doing mulitple jobs, tip them well!"
"i went in with middle of my back long, practically one length hair. i needed a quick easy trim and couldn't get to my normal girl at a real salon for 2 weeks. i told the stylist that i wanted about an inch off, maybe 1 1/2 - 2 inches if i really really needed it.. during conversation, she asked how i usually have my hair cut. i told her usually i have the stylist put a long layer in it (note: i did not ask this stylist to do that.  just a trim).  by the end of my haircut my hair was completely butchered!!!!!!! there was a layer in my hair that came to mid cheek.. i haven't had bangs since the 90's and my hair felt like i was in the mid stages of growing bangs out (ladies you know what i mean!).. i was in such shock about what my hair looked like that i couldn't say anything. i just paid and left. when i got home, i realized i couldn't even put my hair in a ponytail, low or high without using bobby pins to secure the pieces that were too short to be pulled back. i also realized that my hair was uneven and the layers were not even blended. this cut gave new meaning to the word 'choppy'.. i didn't go back and complain because all they would do is tell me that they would like the chance to fix it. i have a problem with that for 2 reasons. #1: channel would never touch my hair again  #2: the only way to fix this mess would be to cut it even shorter and at that point i would have practically a pixie cut.  i am just going to let it grow for a month or 2 and then go to the real salon i normally go to and have a real stylist fix what someone at great clips destroyed..  you really do get what you pay for and i would never recommend this place to anyone. it is awful!!!!"
"we lucked out on this beautiful weather sunday.  after getting our dog groomed at 'petsmart,' i saw the signs for $7.99 haircuts at 'great clips.'  both of my children needed cuts, so this deal was too perfect!   we barely sat down for literally one minute (despite the crowd) and they were both taken back.my daughter loved her trim (just 1/2"" off the length and trimmed up layers) and her sweet hairdresser, kristina.  my son, who is ultra picky about his hair being too short on top, was happy w/ his cut too (not initially).  he's pretty quiet but his hairdresser, erinne, went out of her way to let my son look through a magazine to pick out what he wanted.  very nice girl as well (with funky blue hair!). we'll def be back :)"
"i came here for my hair donation. i can't remember the name of the stylist that cut me, she was blonde. the cut was free, so i can't complain too much, but the ""clean-up"" was hardly clean at all. i have lots of pieces that are uneven and i have to wait a while to get a trim to even everything out or my hair will be shorter than i want it to be. because of this, i have to put my hair in a ponytail because it looks bad if i wear it down. 0/10 will not come back here."
"worst experience at this location. checked in online got to the store and confirmed we checked in. then the three employees pretended we didn't exist. sadly i used to think this location was half way decent. must be due to poorly trained staff who wanted to hurry and leave. again, horrible experience at this location. my review does not reflect other locations who take pride in their customers and recognize negative posting will effect foot traffic. i will never ever patronize this location again and will spread the word about my terrible experience."
the worst haircut ever.  go elsewhere.  save your money and go to a real stylist.  when was the last time a hair hacker 'feathered' your bangs?  when farrah fawcett was a charlie's angels.  incompetent hackers
i get my haircuts here and i've never had a problem. the staff is courteous and professional.
"fast and no waiting, hair cut wasn't bad and the price was right too!if you're going for a ""fast food"" hair cut, you shouldn't have to wait!"
just got my hair cut. no wait and the cut was quick. jo ann was fantastic. i'm usually indecisive when it comes to how i like my hair to look. i told her an idea and she made it look better than what i was expecting. i'm definitely coming back.
i gave this place another try last night. different stylists were working and was greeted and was about a twenty minute wait which was less than i waited last week who thought anyone even greeting me or putting my name on a waiting list. heather did a good haircut and will look for her again in the future. i think the stylists last week just were not into their work that day as usually in the past service has been very good. there was an elderly man ahead of me and i think neither of them wanted to cut his hair so both just kept dragging their feet so the other stylist would finish first and have to deal with the old guy. i understand having to wait when a shop was busy but they really were not that day. great clips location is convenient for me to get to so hope in the future service is better than that day last week.
my daughter went for a trim and then asked to cut it in a blunt style.  it looked like a chop job.  all uneven and i wonder if the hair cutter has a license to cut hair since its so uneven.
"i went in this location for this first time today and was greeted promptly by one of the barbers, and he ""assigned"" boris to me.  i explained what i wanted, which was a simple buzz cut the same length all around.  very easy.yet he started right away with a choppy, hard, inch-by-inch hack job of my scalp.  instead of an easy smooth buzz, i literally received a constant banging against my head with his heavy clippers, until i asked him to go easy.  he said fair, but didn't really change his style.  instead of a nice quick buzz cut i was subjected to an unpleasant experience.  additionally, his workspace was unclean and his trimmers were filled with other customers hair.  not good!!i will not be going back to this location."
"nothing great about that clip. i did not plan to get a haircut yesterday but after an errand next door i walked in and asked if there was a wait. there was no wait. a lady took my name and typed it very very slowly in the computer. she did not know english very well which is fine i get it. after she asked me how i wanted my hair cut i told her to clip it using number three and make it pretty short on the sides but not so short that you can see my scalp. i took off my glasses and she went to work. she used one clipper and cut the bulk of it and then switched to a closer attachment and cut it shorter and shorter. at this point i started worrying and looked concerned i asked her if she was cutting it any shorter. i put my glasses to look at my hair. it was very short, shorter than i wanted. she asked me if it is ok. i said it's shorter than i wanted. i take my glasses back off so she can finish the top and she puts another blade on and before i could even say a word she cuts it even shorter on the sides. i said it's too short and she tries to remove the attachment altogether and but my hair with the bare clippers. at this point i said no no stop stop too short. she said ok ok and kept doing her thing. i finished the hair cut, it was almost completely shaven on the sides.i checked out, paid and left the place completely pissed off.the worst haircut i ever had.at the end of the day i know it's only hair it will grow. my wife, kids and people i work with will stop teasing me in a couple of weeks as the hair grows back. but stay out of this place."
"i have been getting my hair cut here for several months, mostly out of convenience to my gym. i have a fairly straight forward hair cut. two on the sides and scissors on top for a comb over. you literally cannot mess it up. well, apparently you can. or at least carmella can. it was my first time getting my hair cut by her. she acted like she knew exactly what i wanted and then took big chunks off the top of my hair. i keep about 2 inches up top so i can blow dry it. so cutting down to the scalp was a problem. i stopped her once i realized that she was a complete idiot and she was arguing that i do my hair wrong. like, what? okay, so she tries to fix it but it looks like i let a child cut my hair, and on top of that, when my hair does grow back, nothing will be the same length. i don't know what the hiring process is here, but if carmella can't do a simple cut then she's gotta go. i'm not coming back until she's gone."
"i come into the same bala cynwyd location i always do. ask for the same haircut i always do. tint fade. it's recorded. nasirah asks what do i want to do with the top. i said ""don't touch it, i'm growing it out."" she then proceeds to do what she wants and cuts the sides off. that's not a tint fade. i ask her later if she knows what a tint fade is. she says there's no such thing. and she's supposed to be a manager? check the records of my previous haircuts! google ""tint fade haircuts."" it's very simple. she ruined my hair. i now look like a conehead. it will not grow back evenly the way i had it before. i just wanted the bottom side trimmed down, not the entire side. which is why i was very specific with her!"
great service - nashira always gets it done right. check in online before hand always saves time
"after a few trial and error experiences here, i found mainly through luck a good stylist.  going blindly into a chain like this is pretty much a crap shoot and chances are the person who cuts your hair might not be there the next time.  all and all a friendly place."
i rushed to get to the store for a quick haircut and arrived just before 6:00 on a sunday.  i was informed that they were no longer taking any more customers...even a quick clipper hair cut.  they have just lost a repeat customer!
"i was very happy with my cut here. i didn't need an appointment; i just walked right in, sat down, and started to get my hair cut right away. my stylist/barber was very kind, gentle and conversational. it didn't take too long and it was only 12$ (i believe?) for a men's haircut. (this was the cheapest i could find it in the area for a men's cut.)"
"first review, i've ever written....worst.haircut.ever. and even after pointing it out, still was charged full price...south st barbers...a little farther, more expensive...worth every cent...do not go here"
great clips gives the terrible hair cuts. apparently they will give anyone a job with a degree in cosmetics or whatever it is. never going back there again.
doris did a wonderful job cutting my husband's hair just now. she was very kind and did a nice job cleaning all the hair off after she was done using alcohol pads *more sanitary.
"so far, one cut that i was happy with, and one not so much.  one very friendly stylist, and one not so much (i'm pretty sure she was grabbing bites of her snack or lunch in between cutting my hair).  prices are very reasonable and the location is very convenient for me, so i will probably come back."
"jacquelyne did an exceptional job. neat fade, precision and great service was displayed on her part. oh except the constant teasing between us :p  a job well done nonetheless"
"this is nothing against the employee who were very friendly and courteous with my short interaction with them. my complaint here is about the the poor business model implementation. getting people to sign up for an app provides the business tremendous amounts of insight and information that is of huge monetary value, significantly more than the few bucks for a haircut. in turn i would expect the business to offer a little more in return than a piss poor estimated wait time -- in my circumstance, being told to wait another 30mins having shown up a few minutes shy of the estimated wait time. i understand the concept of variance but 30 minutes? it really defeats the purpose of checking in. the short: the user information provided to the business is worth more than the elementary linear model they are using to ""predict"" weight times.. it is 2018 for christ's sake!"
i have been going to this great clips for almost 10 years. they had some of the best hairdressers.  that has all changed. there's new manager and she has replaced almost everybody who has been there a long time. it's sad because now the haircut quality has dropped off immensely. i've had to return to have my hair cut correctly because the girl left it uneven. my children have been getting their haircut there and my son's hair looks horrible. it's uneven and not layered correctly.it's time for me to find a new salon. i recommend finding someplace else to get your haircut.
"been coming to this salon for 5 years and loved it until this week.my great stylist left a few months back (martina) and ive had 2 haircuts there since.  the first one was ""not martina"" but the last one i had there 3 days ago was the worst haircut of my life.  i'm 60 so i've had a couple of doozies, but this is really bad.  i should have been clued in when the stylist asked another stylist if she was 'doing it right"" half way through.  i entered with long, graduated,  layered curly hair and asked for a trim all over and maybe a shorter layer on top. i showed her the picture i have used in various cities over 10 years. i also specifically stated ""no more than a quarter inch off the ends"".  i trust that these people know what they are doing and haven't been disapointed in the past 20 years, anywhere..............................................i now have a 1980's mullett that is 2 inches shorter in length than when i entered, has erratic layers and looks nothing like my hairstyle of the last 5 years (which i loved). i formerly looked like what i am, an aging hippie. i left however looking like a 1980s 12 year old boy.i wont be going there again.  i am seriously pissed at a store that lets seriously inexperienced stylists practice on experienced customers.  i will be wearing scarves till next winter."
"i love the check in feature on the app! it saves a lot of time instead of just sitting there. bridgette did great washing my hair, taking her time to detangle my hair with the conditioner in it! my trim was great value at a cheap price. well worth it."
a stylist named victoria  cut my hair. it was the best haircut i've ever had in my entire life! she was very knowledgeable and very friendly and i was in and out so fast. i was on my lunch break and i was really worried. i will definitely be coming back and recommend all my friends and family!!
"we are traveling in a motorhome, so my wife is always leery of using a hair salon. okay, let's just say that my wife is picky about her hair and who styles it!!!  my wife was in desperate need to have her hair trimmed so she called great clips and was informed that there was no line and she was invited to come right over. the staff were very welcoming as we arrived, took pertinent information and immediately assigned a stylist. it was a friendly environment. my wife's stylist set about to wash and cut her hair. as i observed this process, a casual conversation between my wife and the stylist occurred and made my wife feel more comfortable and relaxed. my thanks to all of the staff of great clips for their talent, friendliness and professionalism displayed and exhibited during this walk-in appointment."
"i always use the phone app to check in - so convenient! i get there and it's usually just as the app indicates for time waiting. always rotating, i think everyone there has cut my hair. inconsistent. i wouldn't think they could mess up my hair since i keep it short - but they did. and with my bad luck, they screwed it up when i needed it to look nice for a big event. this place is conveniently located but i won't be coming back."
"the staff is really nice. after going a few times they start to remember who you are. i always ask for the same stylist, leslie. she really knows what to do with my hair. thank you leslie, you're the best!!bottom line, if you're looking for a good cut at  good price, this is the joint."
"i haven't gotten my hair cut from a professional in a long time...i'm talking years and for the reason of them always cutting way too much of my hair off. i went here the other day and was so scared i'd walk out with a bob. like always. at this great clips that was not the case! amanda showed me how much she would be cutting off before cutting it off! she cut 3"", layered it, and framed my face no problem! i finally found a place i could go to instead of me having to do it myself. so glad i took the chance here! i highly recommend this place if you were like me, never happy with my haircuts. :)"
"this is my second time at this location because it's the closest place to my house but it's strictly for cutting children's hair, and it just doesn't matter who checks in first or if you do it online or whatever they just take the next person they see and they give everybody a very similar haircut which is all i think they really know how to do... if you care about your hair of your money or just the flat out principle means something don't come to this location."
do not go here! they messed up my haircut that was so simple to pull off. the lady spent 10 minutes on my haircut and the place was not even packed. i would hate to have the same thing happen to you.
"i have a short haircut that needs constant trims, and i was so happy to find this place. the ranges for cuts goes from $8 to $14, which is cheaper than any of the salons i went to before. now if i want to do more, i'd certainly stick with the salons, since great clips has steep prices on styling which is the opposite of the hair cut prices. strange. but i keep continuing to come back and get my hair cut here at least once a month, and i like the results. :)"
"why even bother checking in online?  it went from 5 mins to 15 min wait so i checked in and headed over. 10 minutes later when i got there, they told me it was going to be another 20 minutes and i was at the bottom of the list.checked in another day because it said 1 minute wait. i checked in and headed over. was there about a minute later and it was packed. i was fourth on the list, and when i checked again it still shows a one minute wait time and there are six people on the list. when will i learn?"
"actually great clips,   the name on the building says it all.    can't touch their prices if you just want a cut."
i'm very disappointed with the service at this place. they always have a long wait time and it seems that they only 2-3 employees. i waited there for almost 2hrs for a trim! i would recommend making am appointment but good luck being seen at your apt time. the best part of the visit was the girl who cut my hair was very sweet.
"fast service, the woman who did my hair was great and it was the cheapest hair cut i've ever gotten. i was told that my hair cut looked better than when i was paying $200+"
"good people, great service. been going there for a while now, and always going to andrea. she's super cool and funny. although busy on weekends, strip mall parking is aplenty, and if you happen to have a long wait, you can just hit fry's next door to do some grocery shopping while you wait. target and many other stores close by in this convenient location."
i have been going here for a while now and can't say anything bad about it.  the staff are always friendly and knowledgeable.  there aren't too many times when i have to wait very long to get my hair cut.  i have seen many stylists here and haven't had any bad experiences.  very affordable as far as i am concerned.
i love getting my hair cut here. the stylist susan is my favorite hair cutter of all time. she is from chicago and is a vegetarian and is a single mom. she takes care of her son and is quite spoken but when you talk to her she is very sweet. the manager chris is very nice too. she's cut my hair and explains the way of the business. angie is one of the asst manager and has done an amazing job on my hair as well. all these idiots complain about great clips but they're a great company. while not a barber shop but they do give that home feel
"this review is based on my overall experience with this location. i average about two good haircuts for every bad one here.  the bad ones usually come from the same person whose name will remain anonymous but it starts with the letter r. when this person cuts my hair they finish in about 5 minutes and ask if everything is okay. if i were to point out trouble areas they get visibly upset and then quietly fix the issue. also, this person tends to swear and get visibly upset at times. next time i request someone else if this person is there.other stylists have been good and very friendly. i don't want to let one person drag this entire location down but it would be in the owner's best interest to part ways with this employee.this is a good location with minimum wait if you check in using the phone app. i look forward to giving this location a better review in the future"
"worst haircut/""stylist"" (being generous with that term) ever.  i've typically had good luck here, other than the wait. checked online first, since there was no wait listed went ahead and went in since i'm less than 5 minutes away. should have known this wasn't going to go well since the woman who checked me in wasn't speaking, she was mumbling and didn't act like she wanted to be there. when i sat down she spoke to me like she had no clue how to cut hair and that i was supposed to tell her what to do.  i very clearly told her the length i wanted to keep etc. let's just say i won't be back.  she actually had the nerve to look shocked when i didn't tip at checkout."
"worst haircut everdo you want to look like a primordial cosmic worm after your haircut? this is the place to go. especially during their ""haircut sale"". i went today, and was a horrible experience. there was a huge line because of the ""sale"". so the lady who did my hair was clearly desperate. if you have like a owl timer , you can set it to 4 mins 23 seconds, and you will be definitely done. i showed her a pic of what i liked to have usually. she glimpsed at it as if ""yeah, whatever you want, i am gonna give you what i think fits you"". most of the ""looooonnng"" time spent during haircut she tries to sell other products like shampoo and hair conditioners to you instead of focusing on the haircut. do you have scissors/shears at home? look at it before you go to this store. that will be the last time you will ever see a pair of shears. here you are like those kids in pink floyd's brick in the wall video. it doesn't matter if you are a guy or a girl or a kid or an adult, all of you get the same haircut. 6 on top, 1 on bottom, and fades in between. she ran through my hair like she was mowing a lawn. ""chug chug chug chug...oh, i need to change the song, chug chug chug chug...oh, what did you say you wanted, chug chug chug chug...sorry, am done. i'll note what you wanted so that we can do it next time when we actually have time. out you go so that we can get done with the 20 million people waiting after you due to the sale.""oh, then what is special/extra here? ofcourse, price is special..you pay thrice the money and 1/3rd the quality of other places..her name was angela something if that helps you avoiding her.i mean, i believe in evolution. like humans came from monkeys/apes and stuff. but i never thought i will be reminded of that due to a haircut. girls around me looked like they were getting a good cut when they walked out. but guys, one after the other, were walking out looking down.with that dismal shock in their faces, which said: omfg, what the f did i walk into...or on their phone updating their pic on instagram with hashtag smh.bottom line: if you have clippers at home, try it. you probably might do a better job than paying double ass price for a half ass haircut."
"a big ""thank you"" to susan for giving my teenager: ""the best haircut of his life!"""

"decent haircuts at a good price.cost:save a few dollars and get the prepaid ""great card"" for $9.99 haircuts!service: i like the online check-in, which you can do from the web site or with the great clips app. check-in ahead of time, and reduce your wait time to virtually zero.atmosphere:it's a salon in a strip mall, and they're all the same, what's to say?overall:it's convenient, well-priced, and i get decent haircuts. i keep going back."
"horrible service, checked in online and ended up waiting for over an hour and a half. people not even on the list going before me. it was the worst experience ever! i just moved in the area and been using great clips for years and will never return here. please also check the reviews on fb this place sucks!!!! waited 90 minutes to just end up leaving."
"sadly, i have to rate this great clips quite low.  i would have rated them a 1 star, but the manager did issue a refund for my daughter's hair cut and apologized for the situation.while i was shopping at michaels, my kiddo went with her dad to get a hair cut.  i have been so swamped, i did not have time to take her to my salon.  her dad was given specific instructions on how to get her hair cut and to make sure her bangs were not cut and he relayed those instructions to the stylist.  i received a phone call from him telling me the stylist did not know what he meant by ""face framing layers.""  i advised him that he needed to get a different stylist if she did not know what that meant.he agreed and then hung up.  apparently he argued with her for awhile wherein she said she didn't think it would look good on my daughter.  he told her he still wanted it that way, but if she could not do it, then she could wait.  he said to her that since my daughter was preoccupied on the ipad anyway... that she could just sit in a chair and wait for him while his hair was cut.  well, apparently the stylist went ahead and cut my kiddo's hair anyway, including cutting her bangs straight across her forehead.  well, not completely straight, as some hairs were cut very unevenly.  we have been growing out her bangs and training them for several months.  additionally, she cut some layers so short in my daughter's hair that they are above her eyebrows.  her dad went back in to talk to the stylist.  the stylist made a few more snips to correct the unevenness in her bangs.  however, they should have never been cut in the first place.i knew instinctively that i should not have allowed my kid to get her hair cut here, but this was the second time she'd been.  the first time was to correct it after she cut off a hunk of hair herself when she was in school.  the stylist did a good job then.  should my kid have been in that chair when her dad told the stylist to forget about it?  no.  a place like this has so much turn over that every stylist could have an effect on the reviews.  i understand that.  however, it was such a bad experience, we are not willing to chance it again.  it is right before the holidays... and i really think my kid's hair looks like a monkey cut it.  oh well.  hair grows back.  you get what you pay for so... buyer beware."
"awesome place for what minimal hair needs i require. a simple 5 min trim for 8 buck (sale price today) would have cost 50 at a salon (i called around to 3 other salons for a no frills trim...apparently that doesn't exist at a salon). this was exactly what i wanted; walk in, trim, walk out! the staff was friendly, the place was clean. overall good experience and didn't break the bank!"
"mediocre at best. the grumpy man who failed to greet me when i came in ended up being the one to cut my hair. he didn't say much other than the usual, ""what shampoo and conditioner do you use?""  i have long hair and i asked for a trim and to define the layers. he spent 10 minutes cutting my hair and didn't verify if everything was the same length like most stylists do. he spent most of his time spraying me in the eye with his water bottle. let's say, i won't be back."
"need a quick trim, very fast paced and you can check in online"
"i tend to be too lazy or forgetful to get my hair cut often and when i do, i don't do much special (just a boring trim of my crazy long hair).  i usually go to great clips or something similar and the experience is always pretty good. the staff is friendly and does a fine job. i could do with less up selling of hair products. i'm sure they are incentivized to sell products but i could do without it."
"ive been to great clips twice. first time it was just me and second time with my family. both times angela cut my hair. she is great, and i highly recommend asking for angela when getting your hair cut. overall everyone is very friendly and good atmosphere. i am used to getting $40 hair cuts, but after getting my hair cut by angela, i will never go anywhere else. unless of course she moves. angela is very professional, and she gave me great advice on what to use on my hair and how to style my hair. she recommended redken anti-snap product for me, and i purchased it. i love it, my hair is very healthy and stylish all thanks to angela..."
"pretty much get what you pay for. i paid 8 bucks and it looks like it too. i keep my hair pretty short and because of this the mistakes stand out. unfortunately i was too far from the mirror while there and didn't notice the differences in lengths and levels till i got home. but then again, maybe my head was tilted during the haircut.  i wish i had been more attentive and the stylist been more on top of her game. i tipped way too much."
"went here, because i forgot to make an early appointment for a haircut at my usual place. been here 2 times before, for the same reason & they did a decent job.this time they ruined my hair. it looks like i have a birds nest balancing on my head.i was there on saturday morning & the stylist was friendly & nice. i had showered already & my hair was wet. i showed her a picture of what i wanted done & also explained what i needed. she went on cutting & as they charge another fee for a blow dry, i didn't get it done & i had to shower again anyway as they don't even bother to brush off the hair that's all over you after your haircut. maybe that's too much work for them.after i washed & blow dried my hair, it looked like it hadn't been cut at all. pieces hanging out of everyplace. they said they layered it, if they did, it was the worst layers ever.i went back in the evening, & a lady who said she was the manager, said she can fix it & went on snipping at my hair. she just took a handful of hair off the top & went snip, snip, snip. i asked her to thin my hair at the bottom, so that it has some fullness & the ends turn out. she said she will do it, but never did it. i was uncomfortable telling her to do something so many times. i am no hair stylist, but i knew, something was not right, the way she went on cutting.back again i had to come home & shower again. my 3rd shower for the day. dried my hair, only to find, the top of my head, my hair was not even 3 inches long. i couldn't even get it on the brush to dry. the other layer is cut so short, that there is a wave right in the middle of my head, looking like my hair is split in 2 with a birds nest at the top. when i wake up in the morning, i look like ""tina turner,"" lol. all my hair is sticking out the top. let me say i have very thick hair & short hair only gives it more static & spikes it making it look like the smurfs.i called them & the lady says, we will refund the money. lol. i said i didn't want the money, i want my hair. what can money do? buy hair? this is hair we are talking about, which (if i am lucky) will take 3 weeks to grow at least to a decent length. this is not a dress that doesn't fit & the refund can buy me another dress.i went back again on monday, as the manager hilary said there was a good person who can fix it. that was shane. he took one look & said, oh yes, it's way too short & there's not much he could do. i totally agree. what can he do to clean up another persons mess? he did try, but finally gave up.i am now left with this horrible looking haircut & wear a cap most of the time. i had to go buy gel & mousse & products i didn't own before, just to keep the bounce down on the top of my head. if not i look like a hot air balloon about to take off. lol.i guess, you get what you pay for. just horrible. the worst is, that they don't even care. it's like something that happens every day & they have got so used to living with it. but then again, why would they care. it's my hair, not theirs & there is nothing anyone can do to fix it now. it's ruined & i have a function to be at this sunday, which i might not go to. a bad hair day, gives you a bad mood, a bad couple of hair days, drives you nuts. that's for sure."
"shane is amazing! i'm pretty picky since i have fine hair and it shows every cut mark. i like a lot of texture, but no razor! he was able to accomplish all this and i love my hair! thanks!"
horrible horrible horrible horrible i want my money back rebeca destroyed my hair i look horrible i paid to get my hair styled she couldn't even do that. my advice don't go here they will destroy your hair.
i love this place!!!! the ladies here really know what they're doing. 100% satisfied. i'm new to the area and am happy that i've already found my go-to place.
"apparently i love to get my hair cut while out of town. and coming from a guy who barely gets his hair cut (and truthfully, barely has any hair to cut) that means that most of the haircuts of the last 5 years of my life have happened at random out of town spots.well, folks, add mesa to the mix. that's where i got my hair cut today, and that's the latest locale where i lopped my locks. men and women of mesa, take note: you can get your hair cut here, too. you don't have to a be an out of town vagabond. they're here every day chopping away, and you can walk in for a trim. actually, as i discovered today, they're really pushing this whole ""check in online"" thing and have a specific app you can also download. i haven't looked at it, but if it sets a reminder for your haircut then i'm totally into it. i only seem to remember at the most inopportune and rushed times (ie. ""oh crud, i'm going to be on tv tomorrow morning and i look like ringo."")as for the cutters--they weren't the most personable peeps on the block, but when it came down to it they all seemed to know what they were doing. my cutress was a nice enough lady and cut pretty quickly. i didn't get the courtesy ear trim (sexy, i know) but i also didn't ask for it. i did, however, get the courtesy eyebrow trim. so that was a bonus i only seem to get at 1 out of 10 haircutteries."
"if i could give then zero i would. cut 13 style 18, not bad right? wrong. the cut, i told her i wanted more layers an volume, i told her i didnt like my last cut. she processed to follow the exact cut of my hair, so now i have the same cut that i didn't really want. fine ..the style, 30 minutes with a blow dryer and a round brush my hair is flat, with weird bumps at the top? i could have gotten the same results letting a three year old blow out my hair for 15 minutes.i told her that i didnt think i should have to pay for the ""style"" as it wasnt what i asked for. i asked for curls and volume. she says she can curl it?? really like i should believe that? do i give her another 30 minutes of my saturday? i pulled my hair into a ponytail,  paid the 36 bucks and left. moral of the story?dont come to this place if you want a style."
"under new managenent. used to be a decent place, now they're running some sort of wig scam. i'm calling corporate.my family was treated poorly today. my sister and daughter both got bad cuts. they gave a free cut to my sister under the guise that they donate the hair. very sketchy about who they donate to. didnt ask if the hair was treated or dyed. i believe they're making wigs or tracks out of the hair and reselling it. not sure this new management is on the up and up. they panicked at the notion that we might keep the hair instead of donating.i miss old management. at least they were honest and up front. at least they gave each person the cut they asked for. at least they weren't running some shady side hustle."
"the best part about this place is the manager. she seems to be working there all the time, besides giving great haircuts she's a genuinely nice person. they have some good stylists but you must keep on them as to the style you want otherwise they will deviate and that's not cool."
"i visited this place for the first time about 20-30 minutes ago.  i am highly disappointed and will never return here again.  here's why:1: i asked the lady to take off less than half an inch of hair instead she whipped out a #4 and zipped the machine through on one side leaving half an inch on!!! 2:  within seconds i had to stop her once i realized what she had done but it was too late. 3: she admitted her mistake and i remained calm and polite asking her to just even it out.  she tried but it didn't look even to me.  4:  the most disturbing part was how she ended it.  didn't even say bye or thank you when i told her that my hair didn't look even to me.  she went ahead and ""rang me up"" and as i was walking toward the counter she just went back to her station.  she said bye reluctantly i kept saying wait, i haven't paid ma'am...she wouldn't say a word and kept repeating ""bye, bye"".   she made a mistake, admitted it but was very rude at the end.  i insisted that i must pay, had my visa out but she wouldn't even look me in the eye.  i keep insisting and finally, i realized that i had $12 cash which i left on the counter and walked out! this is bad for business and i hope the owner/manager gets my message that i left $12 on the counter because the lady attempted to turn this around on me indirectly making it appear like i wanted a free haircut!  i was genuinely unhappy because of her mistake!  the haircut is $13 but i will go back to give them $1 next time i'm passing by.  i do not need a free haircut, thanks but no thanks."
we've been getting our hair cut here for a while. some great and some not so much depending on the stylist. checked in online with a 15 minute wait. been here over 20 minutes so the check in is useless.
"waited for my turn fair and square, after 30 minutes a lady walks in with 2 daughters and because the mom checked in via her phone app, the stylists had to take all 3 of them ahead of me. that just isn't fair. i got up and left. i can see taking 1 of the 3 ahead of me, but all 3 is bologna. this is a poorly designed marketing gimmick created by the great clips corporation.  go back to first come, first served. i like the stylists at this location, but the corporate policy isn't well thought out."
this place has many good  stylists who take their time to give you a good haircut.i have been here over 15x
"understanding that great clips has a quota to meet for how many haircuts they need per week/month, i was still willing to give them a shot. the lady cutting my hair took notes on what i wanted. i told her that i have two cowlicks in the front, and two in the back- incredibly difficult to deal with if they are cut too short. as the hair cutting begins, everything seems normal. but then i notice that she isn't using water to dampen my hair, like every stylist i've ever used does. she was dry-chopping the top of my hair, cutting off about an inch. it felt very sloppy and was looking very weird. next thing i noticed, she grabs a handful of hair on my back cowlick and cuts it all the way off. i was stunned, but at this point didn't care; i wear a hat most days anyways. the thing that upset me most was when she said, ""so i cut off your cowlick because i don't like them. they stick straight up if u cut them short, so you have to cut them all the way down. and when they start sticking up, thats when you know you need to come back and get another haircut anyways."" needless to say, i'll never be coming back here."
"seriously disappointed with my hair cut.  i wanted a pixie with layers on the back,  the girl gave me a buzz cut! i told her i wanted to keep the length of my bangs and the girl started cutting them."
"i came here because cost cutters was closed and i left a bit disappointed.   my cut was fine,  i just went in for a trim but since i was going out after i asked the stylist if she could just blow dry my hair. (not style, blow dry)she blow dried it, barely put a spritz of hairspray in and we were done. a haircut costs $12...needless to say, i was a bit shocked when i was charged $31.00.i looked at the board and noticed for a ""regular style"" was $18.  1. i  don't understand how a style costs more than a cut, 2. i was shocked i was charged their full price of a style when all i asked for (and got done) was a simple blow dry.  when i asked for a blow dry, she should have made it known it would cost me an additional $18.i was pretty upset when i walked out and because of that, i won't be back.  i have never paid near that for a blow dry.  $5, maybe. $18?! i don't think so!"
jenna cut my hair.  i'm always nervous about letting anyone touch it since it's been screwed up before.  she was very patient with me and cut a little at a time and checked in with me then continued after i was okay with it.  some beauticians like to chop the hell out of it and ask questions after.  she was awesome!
"just another place to get a hair cut. i've never got my hair cut here, but my bf has. he was going somewhere else for his haircuts but it was quite a drive to go there every other week. so he's settling with great clips. which he is satisfied with how they cut his hair. he's a pretty picky person when it comes to someone cutting his hair, and surprisingly he likes the barber/hair stylist salon styler person that did his hair and will return for future haircuts. great clips is a pretty decent place for haircuts and the pricing isn't that bad. overall its worth going to."
great customer service with kids. as an exhairstylist myself i know that kids are the hardest to deal with. they have little toys and  stuff for them to play with in the back if mom or dad need a cut while the kiddos wait. love the staff! tip them well. hairstylist live off tips.
"sarah cut my 3yr old boy's hair, she has great customer service, friendly and interactive with my kids and did a great job clipping his hair.  she went quickly without messing up!"
"always have a good experience every time i get my hair cut here. they also send out coupons, making their service even more affordable. i love the online checkin option, allows me to know when to show up- i don't think i have ever waited more than 2 mins. i definitely recommend them !"
"i would give no stars if i could. my husband and i took my 2 year old who was in desperate need of a haircut. we asked number of times if they were familiar with cutting a child's hair, to which we were told ""i have kids of my own, i know how to cut children's hair"". rudely we were asked if we wanted our son on the chair or to hold him. he was naturally terrified of the razor and when he just wouldn't stop crying we had to ask her to stop. she didn't even make an attempt to even win him over or try talking to him. he had hair everywhere, in his mouth and his ears, we asked politely to use the sink to rinse this out, as he started coughing to which she said ""let me ask my boss, there might be a charge""! are you freaking kidding me? they charged us full price for a half done job and we had to wait for permission to rinse our son off. horrible horrible service. don't go!"
"if i could give this place 0 stars, i would. even though i checked in online, i had a long wait because the stylist was too busy doing anything but dealing with me. that should have been my first clue. when she finally deigned to call on me, she asked if i wanted to donate. i agreed, on the condition that the end result be a specific length, she agreed, and confirmed how long it should be. she then hacked off the ponytail way too high and then blithely cut off 3 more inches than agreed upon. this was a trim only and should not have been that complicated!! anyone who needs to cut off 3"" to ""even things out"" is incompetent and should not be working as a stylist. when i saw how much she had taken off, i was shocked. no tip for her. i know how long my hair needs to be to be manageable, and this is way too short. it's more in my face and all over the place than when it was down to my waist!!!never go here. if you do decide to have that lapse in judgement, don't donate. suck it up and pay the cost, because i swear they must get bonuses per inch if they are willing to ignore the customer to the degree that this ""stylist"" did. i almost wish i had paid so i could have the satisfaction of demanding my money back."
i get my haircut every two weeks...they make me feel like its a small town barbershop..quick and great service..always have some sort of a promotion going on..would recomend
"i come here often because it is so close to home and they usually fit me in with no wait. i've never had a bad experience though also never had an amazing one. alana did such a fantastic job i had to write a review. she was friendly and easy to talk to, she listened very well to what i wanted and did a great job cutting my hair. she has a fantastic attitude and clearly works hard too, as i don't think she was feeling well but she made it in to work anyways and was cheerful and pleasant. thank you alana!"
great place to get a horrible hair cut and sweat your butt off while getting it done!!! why can't people follow simple instructions??? i'd rather shave my head than get another hair cut from this place!!!!!
"i decided to have my husband cut off nearly 12 inches. misguided, yes, but wasn't bad. it did need to be cleaned up though. jessica basically saved me from myself. she patiently explained how hair is cut a certain way or another, to make it fall how you want, and do what you want it to do....i honestly didn't know there was more to it than just chopping it off wherever you pleased! loved my hair.the next day i wasn't sure (each side curls differently, it's parted on the side, and one side is thicker, so it really is hard to tell). jessica got me right in. on a saturday morning! no questions, no problems. she did some minor adjustments and i learned a bit more. if my uneven hair was all my imagination, she was gracious enough to not say so. i'll definitely be back :-)"
"you get what you pay for. my haircut was uneven, the service was ""okay."" the lady did a good job with my bangs. i felt like the hairdresser started becoming friendly when i was about to pay. i was seen as a walk in, didn't have to wait at all. place was clean. will come back but probably just for a bang trim."
"do not take your children here! i had a terrible experience this morning when i attempted to have my toddler son get his hair cut at this location. i checked in online; we were up next when i arrived and a woman named marta was immediately rude to us as soon as we walked in the door. my son had not made a sound, but she looked at him (certainly did not greet him) and aggressively said, ""if he cries or gets upset i will not cut his hair."" i was very caught off guard because i have never had a stylist be so unfriendly towards a child trying to get a haircut, especially when he was not even upset. i told her that he usually sits on my lap and we just try to make it work the best we can - recognizing that he is a toddler and can sometimes be unpredictable - and she again said she would refuse to cut his hair if he was even the slightest bit upset. i said that with that attitude, it was probably for the best that she did not cut my son's hair, and she seemed to non-verbally agree (definitely did not apologize or try to dissuade us from leaving or even attempt a haircut), and i walked out. i am very disappointed with this stylist's awful attitude toward children. great clips markets itself as a family-friendly establishment and should not employ stylists who refuse service to children for literally no reason other than their age. we will not return to great clips, especially when there are so many alternatives that will treat children like people, as they deserve."
went to this great clips yesterday 6/11/17 and got my normal haircut. the stylist kavitha was trimming the back of my neck and cut it multiple times and never said a word. the. she put powder on her cloth and went over it hiding the redness. once i got home my girlfriend pointed out it was extremely red with little cuts. if you go here do not get your hair by kavitha!
it's the first time i've been there and the girl with the tattoos hasn't cut my hair some guy did it and have to say not happy with it pretty much left it the same length even though i told him what i wanted.
"we bring the littles here -- they do a solid job, they're patient with all the anxieties kids have (or at least mine do), the online check-in is terrific (especially on mobile devices) and it's not too hard to find a sale or promotion. doesn't cost a lot. doesn't stress me out and more importantly -- doesn't stress them out.tip of the cap to the management."
great haircut from becky today! she was very polite and professional!  she asked specific questions to make sure she knew exactly what i wanted.
"love karla, but when she's not there, they are all pretty good at hearing your needs and producing a perfect cut & style.  i won't go anywhere else.  oh, and of course you can't beat the price."
"it's called great clips, but it sure seems more like ""mediocre clips.""i went in last night with my dad last night, and was greeted like normal and i figured it was going to be a pleasant experience like every other great clips i'd been to. when it was my turn to get a haircut, i sat in the chair, and showed christine the picture of what i wanted. it was pretty straight forward; layers, face frame and a bang trim which is what i've been getting for ages, so i really just needed everything trimmed up. you know something's wrong when your hairdresser says ""oops.""  long story short, my hair was four inches shorter, when i was told it would only be one inch, tops. my bangs are about a half inch too short (if you have bangs you know a little is actually a lot), the layers were blunt, and the length of my hair was literally lopsided. i had to go to another salon today to save my hair. when i got to the salon, the hairdresser said ""wow, well at least she left something for us to work with."" when she saw the..... 'creation' on my head. long story short, i will never, ever, ever go to this great clips again. it was, for lack of a better word, one of the worst experiences i've ever had getting a haircut."
"two bad haircuts in a row. i am done with great clips. bad haircut in september, took three months to grow it back out. went in with a picture of exactly want i wanted. ignored. cut it back above my ears again. i asked why and was told it looked better. i wanted what i wanted, not what somebody else wanted. don't go to great clips unless you are happy with the one haircut they know how to do. me? i am done!"
"i had been getting my hair cut at an expensive salon for years. i've been growing it out for the last year and finally decided to get a trim to clean up the ends. i bit the bullet and went to great clips, and i got the haircut i wanted for the cost of a tip at the previous place. karla was great; she listened to what i wanted and made good conversation.tips: - check in online or on the great clips app. it'll let you know what the wait times are at locations near you and hold your place in line. - normally they just spray down your hair with a water bottle, but you can get a full shampoo and conditioner for just $3 more. - be clear and say exactly what you want. bring a picture or say ""i want one inch off"" and show her where that is on your hair. - the only reason why i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that they don't blow dry your hair at the end. that means you have to go home and blow dry it yourself. it's also hard to judge whether you got the cut you wanted when your hair is still wet."
"i know, five stars for great clips? but it was six o'clock on a wednesday, they were pretty busy but i was in a chair in ten minutes. i was way past due for a cut, there was a lot of work to do but i was out in 15 minutes. the cut i received rivals $60 cuts elsewhere, just with a fairly strong sense of urgency. i had a coupon for $7.99 - don't judge, i make up for it in the tip. it's  a franchise, the stylist did the work, why should someone else get the money? all things considered, five stars is about right."
really friendly staff! they really care about you. just a wonderful place to get your haircut while enjoying a pleasant atmosphere.
"i have been to this location twice - the first was right before a speaking event where i was going to be onstage in front of 850 people! the second was before attending the same event. both times i came here and was absolutely thrilled with how my hair turned out! it's very rare to leave a great clips, loving your hair without styling it or ""fixing"" it once you get home. this place definitely lives up to its reputation as being salon quality for a cheap price! thank you kelly and michael! both of you gave me fantastic hair!"
first time my almost four-year old son didn't cry during a haircut. michael entertained while nicole cut his thick locks. very impressed with the extra time they took on us. michael even entertained my son while my hair was trimmed. very happy customers.
"wow. i usually go to salons, and that's where i take the kids. but this time, we went in a big group, 5 (walk-in) cuts in total, ages 17,13,13,13, and 8. total price 66.00 plus tip. holy good haircuts, batman! i was really blown away by the level of skill that this place had to offer. aren't these cheap places kinda crappy? my perspective has changed. we walked in and walked out in about an hour. craziness.i will have to come back and add names of the stylists. for now, there's pink hair and piercings girl- super smiley, very friendly, and she did a great job on the 2 13 year old girls. then, there was the other lady. wish i knew her name.. i think it started with an h. she was also very nice, and very good. the 17 year old loved her hair. she's been raving about it for 2 days now. she also cut the 13 year old boy's hair. it was exactly what his dad wanted him to get. it looked perfect! and then, my boy. a man cut his hair. he was not very friendly. i felt like i was an imposition. but he gets 5 stars anyways, because i honestly have never seen such a great cut on my son. his dad wanted him to cut off his long hair and i was really disappointed. his hair is blonde, so when it's short, it looks almost see-through. this guy did an amazzzzzing job and i could not be happier. all in all, i'm highly satisfied! definitely the new family spot."
"on a work trip i was hurried, harried and hairy. karla squeezed me in, sized up my hair and delivered a great haircut in 20 minutes while carrying an interesting conversation (unlike the head grabbers i've had who want you to play freeze and stop talking while they grunt and grimace). such a great experience thinking about scheduling work trips just to get my hair cut here!"
"i went in to get a different kind of haircut.  i know great clips doesn't do a lot of different styles, but those hair stylist went to school to learn all different types of styles.  they are looking to do more.  i got dominique.  she had a fun bubbly personality.  i really liked her.  we laughed a lot.  she was so excited to do something different.  she gets 5 stars.the location was super busy but i didn't wait at all.my hair came out somewhat of what i wanted.  short on one side, a little to short than what we discussed, but i'm not picky and i know my hair grows fast.  the other side i wanted to keep my long bangs.  my bangs could have been styled a little more over my ear.  i had to take some hair off when i got home cause it just didn't look right.  after i trimmed it more on the side with my long hair, it looked perfect.  it was a weird style and i wasn't expecting it to be perfect, but i had a wonderful fun experience."
"i have been a regular at this location for the past 3 years and would give it 5 stars.  however, i had one bad haircut last december that i am still trying to outgrow.  i asked for layers in the bottom inch of my hair and ended up getting layers 4 inches higher - does not look good on someone with thick natural wavy hair.  lucky for me, i have had several excellent stylists cut my hair since then and i have about 2 more visits to go before my hair is back to normal and the layers are where they should be.  my only request is that they change the opening hours to 8 or 8:30 am - i live and work nearby and prefer to go in the morning when there is less of a wait."
always a great experience when i go to this great clips. alejandra( alex) does an exceptional job at keeping my hair under control. i've been going weekly to her for a long time and plan on doing so. the rest of the staff here is great and will always go above and beyond to make you feel satisfied. will definitely be going back.
"i  walked in wed. morning and mitchell  took care of me immediately. i showed him a picture and he carefully started cutting my hair to exactly what i wanted. i asked him to shampoo it at the end and its just perfect. short,  textured and easy to wear.   too bad i live in sedona and will have to drive 2 hours for another cut.  next time im in phoenix for trader joes i will make an appointment with him."
this location likes to close 30 minutes early even when you check-in. checked in and showed up to find the store all locked up. classic great clips service.
"went in today, because according to superstition in my culture, if you cut your hair during full moon, your hair will grow back faster...so after waiting 6 months, i finally went for it. yes today is harvest moon, the best moon of the year, i think. walked in, two people ahead of me, i got checked in right away. wait time was 5 minutes because they were fully staffed. awesome. i get called, kristin i think was the name of the stylist. she wasn't too chatty, which i thought was great..she was totally chill, and i love my layered cut. thanks again great clips, see you in a year!"
"i've been here twice now, and it seems like a good place to get a haircut.  the online check-in makes it very convenient, and you can get in quickly.  dulce cut my hair and i got the best haircut i've had in a long time.  she was quick and efficient and an absolute pro.  i'll be back soon!"
this is the only place that i go to. the online check in works great. my wait time has always been minimal.  i have always had great experiences and i think ever is very talented. i always feel welcome and love when they remember my name and how i like my cut. i always feel great after leaving. i have never been disappointed.
"i've been going here for many years. but, now i am looking for another place to cut my hair.  why?  long ass waits- i checked in via their mobile app, which says, 56 mins.  i arrive 60 mins later and i am still waiting over 45 minutes to hit the chair.  this has happened 3 times in one month and the other two times i left before getting my haircut.  this location is always under staffed....seeking new barber."
"i was desperate for a cut and my usual spot is too far and i the wait would make me way late for my ride to palm springs. i called gc just after 9am and there was zero wait time. i lucked out because as soon as i got there the online check ins were adding in the queue. eddie took care of me. super nice, great cut and perfect timing. i even had time to get home to trim and dye my beard. i'll definitely be back. i really look sharp."
"great service and the online check in is very convenient to avoid waiting, a. figueroa is attentive and this is the second time he cuts my hair as i want"
just got one of the worst haircuts of my life from a girl named alex. had to go home and use my own clippers to cut away her terrible job! terrible! beware
right now they have the $7.99 haircut special which always is great for back to school. i've been coming here for at least two years with different family members. online check-in gets you in quicker. but everyone is very nice and courteous. brianna and edward have given us great haircuts.
"i had a great experience yesterday. i used the online check in system from my desk and headed straight over. it said i would have a 17 minute wait when i checked in, and once i got there i sat maybe 5 minutes.  my stylist was asked a lot of questions and he did a great job on my hair (hadn't been cut in almost a year...such is the life of a twin mom), and did a great blow out (took time, but it was so worth it) after with product so i could get back to work. i was gone from work a grand total of 61 minutes with travel.everyone commented on how great it looked when i got back (first time it wasn't pulled back in a clip for 4 months).will definitely go again."
"i've been coming here for the last year, as family members had been going for years before that. i've had my hair cut by numerous people here and they do a decent job. the quality ranges from good to excellent. if you go on line to make an appointment the wait isn't as long but there's still a wait. that's okay, as if i went to a place like this and there was no wait at all, i'd wonder why they don't have any customers. the cost is reasonable, they work with both genders well and so i'll continue being a customer. only suggestion is that i'd like to be able to make an appointment on line before they open, the site doesn't work until then."
"giving them 3 stars because i have had some great experiences here in the past. brianna, if you need a perm or even just a cut, is great and i wish i could continue to go back and see her, but, alas, i will never return after this last experience.i have had my hair permed twice at this location (both times by brianna, who i now trust with my hair...which is harder than trusting someone with your life) and 7 months since my last perm, the curls are mostly fallen out (it happens) and take a load of styling gel to look even semi-good most days. add on 4 inches of new growth and it was time to get a new perm. i had to have it done soon, preferably this weekend, because of a family trip next week so i called to make an appointment. brianna, i was told, was not going to be available until wednesday afternoon. i had some anxiety about having a stranger do my perm, but it had to be done. so i booked it. now let me make it clear. i had explained to the woman who booked my appointment  (with liz i believe was her name) that i had had my hair permed there 7 months ago, i needed a full perm because the curl was mostly gone, etc. i get there this morning and i'm told by the stylist that i have ""plenty of curl left"" (i'm not sure how to attach a picture, but trust me...that's not the case.) even though i let her know that this was my hair fresh from the shower and that had temporarily refreshed the curl. it would be gone once it dried. she then pulled on some strands of hair, towards the end of my hair, and claimed there was too much breakage. oh right, big surprise. i have at least an inch of split ends after 7 months, i'm lazy about getting trims and i needed one, but above that inch or so my hair is plenty strong. she requested a consult from management, who was very condescending towards me and barely listened to me at all. continuously talking over me and making claims about perms that are outdated and did not apply to my situation in any case.  if they didn't know have someone on staff for that day who was competent at performing perms, then they shouldn't have given me an appointment. now i have to make a new appointment at a private salon (where the price is, oddly enough, the same as at great clips) that will force me to take a vacation day at work before my trip. if they had simply told me they couldn't do the perm with their current staff i would have booked elsewhere in the first place and not wasted my morning."
just had my haircut from briana. it was horrible.  she did the haircut in 15 min. the fade and side burns were uneven. she did not texture the top and or use thinning shears like i asked her too. i will never go back.
"two stylists on friday evening. i've been waiting an hour while chatty kathy has managed to do 1 1/2 haircuts. the other stylist just had four friends walk in and he skipped one of them alllll the way to the head of the line. cute. too late for me to go anywhere else, so i'm going to keep waiting. smile nicely and let my tip reflect my aggravation."
"phoenix, az: just come here to see heber hernandez, if you can get him.  my hair is impossible to cut well and he knocked it out like it was nothing.  the guy should be charging $50 for picking up the shears."
"i am visiting from northern california and want to say how terrific ms. alex is. she gave me a wonderful cut, listened to all my idiosyncrasies about my hair, and was so cheerful and sweet the whole time. love my haircut! thanks alex."
late review... was here about 6 months ago. service was horrible i had my hair cut by cathy and she was unbelievably rough while washing. felt like she was hand washing a tough to remove stain from clothes and i left with a horrible neck ache. i would suggest talking less and being for caring for your customers. don't need to take a visit to the chiropractor after a hair. will not return to this location.
"went in close to closing time, was greeted almost immediately by one stylist and was given an accurate wait time. during my wait i was quickly hesitant to be taken by the woman that greeted me, no conversation and quick to cut before communicating with her customer. luckily i was taken by the other stylist, helen. she was upbeat and open to conversation, she worked well with my parameters because i'm growing out an awkward cut but wanted to clean it up. she walked me through her thoughts since i came in unprepared, kindly explained why her suggestions made more sense then what i was originally thinking & i'm glad i agreed! thanks again helen!"
"by far the worst great clips i've ever been to. i only go to these places for a quick fade or something simple since the service at some locations is mostly sub par to say the least. the woman that cut my hair had a terrible attitude from the start. every time i would move, scratch my face, check my phone, she would pull her hands from my head really fast and wait until i was done, like seriously? i'm hardly moving and you make it blatantly obvious and may be inconveniencing your job? psshh woman get off your high horse, you ain't hot and you have a terrible personality.i came in today. she was there. i signed in online and was next on the list. another patron came in and i was skipped for whatever reason. i didn't ask and just walked out. i'll be picking a different location next time."
"red flag: since great clips started allowing customers to sign in remotely via a smart phone, most of my friends have stopped going there. as a chronologically gifted group (seniors), most still have flip phones and when they arrive to sign in there are already too many people ahead of them (those with smart phones that have signed in via smartphone). also, walk-ins are at a disadvantage for the same reason. the cost of a senior hair cut has risen from $11 to $12.the cost of a hair cut does not include a shampoo (like fantastic sam's). my most recent visit resulted in an ok haircut, but a very rude hair stylist."
"always skeptical when it comes to trying out new places to get my haircut, but boy this great clips was perfect. the staff was extremely friendly, clean store, and almost no wait. my stylist, helen, was awesome. she was very attentive to all the little details and super personable/hilarious. will be back in 3-4 weeks!"
"after quite a few good experiences i went there again. this time it was very dissapointing, hairstylist helen was frustated, rude and is always in a hurry to finish the haircut. complete haircut took hardly less than 5 min, i hope she will treat the customers with respect from next time. ***never getting a haircut from helen again***"
"will never return - the lady was rude to me the whole time and i was just trying to be nice. i asked her about her day and she gave me an attitude the whole time. she rushed my hair, the back was uneven on one side and they pushed me out the door and then i went home and fixed my hair. honestly, spit on the window when you walk by and let everyone know how awful the service is."
"after a previous good experience i came back here, and i'm highly disappointed. i mentioned several times to helen that i wanted to keep the length on the top of my head, and she proceeded to chop more than half of it off. when i told her i was disappointed with how much she took off, she defended what she did instead of even trying to apologize. i doubt i will be back, and i sure as hell won't let her cut my hair, again, if i am."
"like all great clips, checking in online saves a lot of time. stylists are friendly and helpful. helen in particular does a great job. thank you!"
"cameron is amazing! i had a pretty bad experience the night before with a different stylist and didn't see how bad it was until the morning. i went back (on the verge of tears) and cameron fixed it so you couldn't even tell how much of a wreck it was when i came in. he was professional, personable, and very understanding. cameron is clearly very experienced and knows what he is doing--i am so grateful to have had him cut my hair!the reason i have to give this location 4 stars instead of 5 is because of my experience the night before with jeryll. i don't know how he got his cosmetology license, because it seems like he has never cut hair before. i didn't want anything fancy, i just needed 1 inch off of my layers and a bang trim. when i left, there were no layers on one side because it was so choppy, and on the other side the front half of my hair was just below ear length and the back half was a couple inches below shoulder length. my bangs were uneven and were not the same length. i couldn't believe that anyone could cut hair so poorly with their cosmetology license. despite this, i won't judge the location based on one stylist. everyone else was professional and welcoming. as long as you get the right person, you will have a great experience. ask for cameron! he's very talented, and i plan on returning to see him in the future."
i took my daughter in for her first big girl haircut this afternoon. we called ahead and asked for the person most best suited for dealing with a rambunctious three-year-old and was quickly told rosie was the best. that recommendation could not have been more spot-on. she was fantastic and understanding what i wanted and was so sweet to my daughter. her hair came out fantastic and we will definitely return.
"i have been a long time customer of this location and they have always treated us like family.  i shave my own head now, but still come here to have my boys  hair cut.  quick, quality and low cost."
"i just love cindy. she gives me a great haircut short and easy to style. i used to go to expensive salons thinking i would get better and style and service because i was paying a premium, but my experience at this great clips location is by far the best i have gotten and cindy is so personable amd friendly i look forward to my next visit"
"i had a decent hair cut, but very poor customer service. i was insulted the entire time about my hair care. will not be returning."
"came here because reygan works here.  she gives great, honest advise when you really don't  know how your hair will look best.   she considers how much time you are really willing to spend on your hair each morning.  really pleased with my haircut."
"not every experience was like mine i'm sure. i've had plenty of good haircuts here but after the last, i'll be finding a new spot."
"i've been here several times, being a former asu kid and never quite moving out of tempe.  they have great deals - those $7.99 sales (i feel like i've achieved crazy coupon lady status whenever i chance upon these), and the convenience of checking in on their website so that you can minimize your wait in-store.i had long-ish (about mid-back) layered hair and just yesterday cut it into a long bob and i love it.  the lady (alicia, i think) was a perfectionist and gave me wonderful advice on how to style my hair.  for instance, how i could hide the fact that my bangs were framing my face - something typical for layers, but not quite advisable for bobs, and how to get rid of those ugly duck tail edges, since it's at that awkward length where your hair follows the curve of your neck.taking off a star because my boyfriend's hair wasn't quite as stellar as mine, having his hair trimmed by somebody who literally graduated from cosmetology school a week ago.  there were several long strands that were missed and cause i am a little ocd, it took a tremendous amount of restraint on my part from plucking off those strands before we reached home and i could find a pair scissors."
my favorite spot. the service is always good. the staff is super friendly and i have not had a bad cut yet. being able to check in online through their app is perfect!  quick in and out.
"for a quick, inexpensive haircut, great clips is my choice location. their mobile app is excellent for finding one nearby (yelp is good too!), and getting checked in ahead of time. i've been able to walk right in and get seated without waiting around for my name to be called. it feels like you're cheating the system, but all is fair in love and haircuttery. the price for a haircut here is cheaper than many others and competes with supercuts. all said and done, i can leave with my ears lowered for under $17 bucks including tax and tip. the stylists at this location are really friendly and make for an enjoyable experience. to get your money's worth (and avoid those stray itchy hairs all over your neck), ask them to rinse your hair and add a little product before you leave. it's easy and makes you look presentable if you're going back to work or a social affair. though you're not going to get all the same attention to detail of an upscale barber, sometimes all your head needs is some routine maintenance."
"i love this place! i'm never disappointed with anyone i have cutting my hair. it's just as good as going to a salon (believe me or don't, but i've never had a bad experience here like other great clips.) but today i had rosie, and she was so sweet! you could tell it was hectic in there because of the $7.99 deal, but she was still calm and polite. also, rosie was very caring for my hair, did a great job, and was so kind and helpful! definitely coming back to see her again soon."
"i would give zero if i could. their check-in online system means nothing, twice i've been here, checked in and they just take whoever they want in whatever order. bring it to their attention and they offer no apology.  i won't be back."
love coming here !  staff is friendly and asia is amazing. would recommend this location to everyone.
"just walked in literally 6pm on the dot. she turned me away and said, ""we close at 6."" wow. well, if your going to turn into a pumpkin, you should have locked the doors.  wouldn't want you to go above and beyond by any means. last time i ever go here! unbelievable."
"after fighting my 5 year old son's request to cut his adorable long locks for quite some time, i had a weak moment on a saturday afternoon in march... i had both of my kids with me after a trip to the target in this shopping center, and i made a pit stop at this great clips location to see what kind of wait there was to get in.  to my surprise, i learned that there was not a wait and that regina could get my son in right away.  i was hesitant already to trust a stranger with my child's first haircut (outside of the trims he'd gotten from a family member previously).  i swear - i had butterflies in my stomach as my daughter and i watched... i was also nervous about how my son would do sitting in a big chair, sitting still for the cut and the shave, etc... but he did great!we requested a mohawk and i showed regina some images of what i had in mind.  she told me we should go the fauxhawk route instead and suggested the ideal length so that when we didn't style it, it would still look decent... she did her thing and my son has gotten a ton of compliments ever since!i was upsold on some gel for the fauxhawk, so we walked out the door 20 minutes or so later with a clean cut and very excited kid plus a firm hold gel for $21.85 + tip.  as we drove home, my daughter requested a mohawk also... ""no honey,"" i said.  i think it will be a long time if ever before i let that happen!i had low expectations of great clips, but they definitely delivered and i'd return for a fauxhawk clean up in a heartbeat!"
"when you find your person, it is horrible when they leave or you move away. i moved to phoenix and had a lot of anxiety about finding a new place to get my hair cut for a cheap price. i came here because it's down the street from my place and great clips has good pricing for cuts. i'm happy to say on my first go, i found my new person. louisa is amazing. she is very good about listening to what you want and checking with you continuously to make sure it's what you were asking for. she is great and i'm glad i found her. 5 stars for louisa!! as for the actual store, it feels a little chaotic in there and the bathroom was a little dirty. i guess aim for slower times and if it's really don't use the bathroom."
"had to redo  worst haircut ever ,had to do it three  time,they can't cut hair,and the first time i went the woman added 2 dollars to her tip -5  they practical y shaved my head even it  out thanks******* s"
"i tried great clips on a whim since i was shopping in the complex where it's located. my first haircut was a nice change for me, but it was just a blunt cut without much style. the stylist was adequate.but a few months later i had a coupon and decided to try another stylist there. i was introduced to robin, an extremely experienced stylist. she literally transformed my hair! she cut it short and sassy, but with a lot of design and style. i loved it! so easy to maintain the new style too.robin is a very fashionable, beautiful blonde so hard to miss! i now only go to her. i'm from san francisco where a cut and style run from $89-120 no joke. i've been to some of the top salons in phoenix and scottsdale (when i've been able to afford it) and my tab for cut, color, style has been at least $100. robin's skills and the results i get to enjoy are as good as the top salon stylists i've been to. everyone compliments me. i can do different things with the hairstyle. if the long bangs start to get hard to style she will do a bang cut for a reduced fee. i always tip $10 and should really show even more respect for her skills with a higher tip.if you want to look like you just stepped out of the most chic salon with an incredible cut, go see robin! what a find."
"i go to the great clips at 44th st and e thomas rd in phoenix az.  when holly cuts my hair, it's always the highest quality. holly listens to what is requested and is very professional.  the last 2 times she was not available so i took my chances with the stylist available.  big mistake.  last month my haircut was uneven, but i accepted that and tried to trim it up myself at home. today was a different matter altogether.  while the stylist was very courteous and friendly, he clearly did not listen to me and left me looking like a shaved freak.  i asked for a trim and told him how i wanted my hair to ""layer and feather"".  i specifically told him that i did not want a short/shaved/spiked haircut.  i told him that i used to wear my hair short over 10 years ago, and how i certainly do not want that now.  i am mortified with the freakishly short ""ostrich"" haircut i have.  i told him i wanted my hear to feather.  a crew cut cannot feather.  when i asked him to not leave a ""tail"" on my neck, he completely shaved the back of my head over an inch above my hair line.   i specifically went in to get a professional trim prior to a very important job interview.  i am a professional person in a professional position and i am also a senior citizen.  this haircut is not only offensive, it makes me look like i am mocking administration.  i look completely unacceptable because of great clip's circus haircut.  this is the most embarrassing appearance i have ever had, at a time when i need to look highly professional.   i even cancelled a plane ticket as i just cannot be seen by my family looking this freakish, unprofessional, and offensive."
"quality haircuts at a bargain price. if you're nervous, ask for gladys or nicholas. both of them are great at their jobs and take the time to produce the results that you ask for."
"they stole money from me. so check this out. i went to get a haircut, i liked it. it was a great haircut. i pay, i tip, i sign. apparently i didn't tip enough. the guy rounded what was a total of $16 to $18. sure it's only $2 but that guy straight up stole from me. who does that?? that is so unprofessional! never going back there again. that's just terrible. congrats guys, you hired a thief."
"first time visiting a hair salon in years. i used the app to check in early. robin cut my hair. she is very professional and friendly. she asked me what i wanted and i got it. i will definitely recommend her to my other friends and will be returning in the future. if you get lost trying to find it, it is kind of hidden near fry's."
"nope. my small son has autism, and doesn't like hair on his clothing (sensory). we normally love great clips for being so flexible, when we attend the facility off cactus road we have experience excellent and kind service. however, at this arcadia shop, an elderly blonde mutton-dressed-as-lamb gave us static for removing his shirt. holy crap, a five-year old's nipples might show before we put the cape on? we whipped his shirt back on an left, to the apologies of the rest of the staff. someone should fire that one for being so insensitive to handicapped children."
"anabel gives a great shampoo.  it was exactly the temperature i requested, and she made my head feel fantastic!  she also gave me a great cut in relatively short amount of time ( a serious bonus for me) and when i asked her if she minded if i didn't talk, she was impeccably polite.imho, she should be working for a place that pays better than great clips, but i am grateful that she was there at great clips!"
"i have been here a few times and have never had an issue , went yesterday for a quick hair cut and she completely butchered my hair!! i asked for a short hair cut which i showed her a picture of what i kind of wanted....instead she just cut the back of the head in the middle super short and left the rest long! nothing like the picture i showed her! i went to another location today to get it fixed( even tho i didn't want to step foot into another great clips) and the guy was super nice about fixing my hair for free.. he said it looked as if it was in a pony tail and she just cut my pony tail off! which is exactly what it looked like, he fixed my hair the best he could but sadly even tho he fixed it the back of my hair is super short and my hair line is a triangle so it's a large triangle ! i know hair grows back but it is so upsetting that this happened!"
"i want to specify i am leaving this review for this location, not the chain as a whole.i'm really bummed to have to leave such a negative review, but i'm hoping this is read from someone who is in a position to do something about it and can take it as constructive criticism. ok, onto the rating...a little recap of my experience...i checked into this great clips using my online app. i don't normally visit this location, but i was in the neighborhood visiting my parents and was hoping to squeeze it into my work lunch hour. i saw my check-in time as a 17 min wait and figured that was okay because by the time i drove there i'd be able to get in pretty quickly thereafter....wrong. i arrived and was not greeted at the door, so i was never counted as being, ""checked in."" the wait list appeared on a monitor and showed i was 3rd in line. ok i thought--there's several people working hopefully this shouldn't take too much longer if i'm 3rd...even though by this point according to the app i should have been up. i let it slide because really, what can i do about it? the problem i have here is that i, like many people who use the app, rely on these estimated wait times because we are trying to fit it into our work schedules, lives, all of us are busy....but for a company that prides itself on getting people in and out conveniently for this not to be accurate--there's a problem. now like i said above, this review really isn't supposed to be about the company, but rather the location. up until this point, most of my check-in's have been fairly accurate with other locations, so i don't know who's to blame here.... so i sat and waited, one person called off the list (awesome, only 2 in front of me) another one called who was not there (ok...i should be next!) but then the person under me on that list was called! what?! so i stood up and informed the gal working at the front that i was an online check-in and that i hadn't been accounted for yet because no one had greeted me, but that i was there and ready. she had me write my name and phone number down. why? i have no clue because i was an online check-in that shouldn't matter...but whatever. so i did anyway, and yet the man behind me was still called, despite the fact i was in front of him. ok....i thought, starting to feel annoyed...it's fine--surely i'm next. i sat and watched the clock, knowing that if i wasn't called within 10 minutes, i'd probably not have enough time to get my hair cut and get back to work on time. so i waited, and waited...almost 10 minutes passed and a girl was called who wasn't even on the wait list. i then waited some more and then, the final icing on the cake, some mans name from the bottom of the list made it on top of mine. are you kidding me?! so now, i was over 20 minutes waiting (on top of the already aforementioned 17 minutes) and now not even next...i walked out, disappointed and frustrated having used up all my lunch time and haircut-less. there are several things disturbing about this: 1) the lack of acknowledgment when i walked in the door resulting in me not being ""checked in"" even though i was and had been waiting and someone moving ahead me on the list but also 2) then several other people were moved in front of me on top of my 3) already long wait time that exceeded what the app had predicted. i don't know if this is a management issue, the app, or a heinous concoction of the both...but i sure hope they pull it together."
"i believe her name is shannon or sharon not quite sure but if you can avoid her do so by all means she extremely rude. i should of known that by the way she checked me in typically you walk in they check you in asap i come in and wait at the counter for 2 minutes or so after she greets me waiting for her to check me in once checked in she tells me it'll be a moment or two so take a seat. after she cleans her area i'm called up next during the haircut she ask me what i do after telling her i work for a financial firm i can see her roll her eyes in the mirror. after a few minutes into the haircut i request she doesn't shave my beard jokingly i say for insulation purposes she follows up by asking if i want the hair in my ear shaved or should she leave it for insulation purposes. i also requested to not trim the hair on top of just the back and sides, did she listen? of course not. the absolute worse haircut i've had at this establishment."
"neat! i got my hair washed here almost two weeks ago. yes, it's come to that. i have people wash it for me. (it's eeeeassier when you're on walking sticks.) i figured, ""hey, six bucks. why not?""i walked in (ha), my taxi driver left .... and *then* i learned, on a chilly fall day, that blow drying my hair would run $45. (my hair goes past my shoulders.) i didn't want it styled. just dry. as in ""not sopping wet"". i figured i would have to pay another ten bucks or so. but not a full blow out price. i also was not in need (or have any interest) in getting a hair cut here.asking to self blow dry (an option back home in new york) was also a no. i was told to hold a blow dryer in a salon requires a license.ooook.all was not lost however. the nice ladies here later realized my predicament and worked me a favor. they let me sit under the big old air dryer. the kind you use when you're getting highlights. that was pretty sweet!i have to say my hair wash was one of the most luxurious washes i've had in ages. so much so i purchased the shampoo/conditioner.i didn't catch the name of the super duper woman who washed my hair. but she's a doll. pixie hair cut. blond. nicest woman ever!"
extremely unfriendly. i came in for a very simple buzz cut and asked one question to go over a certain area of my head and she gave me a hard time. this place is only good for getting in fast. i won't be coming back to this location.
"these girls that work there are so bitchy. they were so mean to my son. so unwelcoming! i will never ever bring my family there again! i thought they can manage a trim, a fade. it's not some high fashion salon! it's a cheap hair cut place! these girls need to go back to cosmotology!"
"my stylist was very knowledgeable. yay, 13$/haircut!  she even knew about my natural curls & told me how that would work w/haircuts i wanted. thanks!"
"with all the negative reviews on yelp about this location, i have to admit i went in expecting to not even be acknowledged even though the on line check in stated no waiting time @ 2p on a wednesday. but to my surprise, a friendly face did greet me as soon as i walked in. she chopped my hair exactly how i wanted it. my chunky over grown home slashed bangs were no longer a mess and soon my one length hair was styled beautifully with layers. i am 6"" lighter and loving it. i would definitely come back without hesitation."
"my hair was an absolute mess, but stylist xc____ saved the day.after very quick service to check in, without having to create an annoying 'profile,' stylist xc____ carefully listened to what i was looking for (a thorough trim, not full cut), then she carefully combed out my hair, carefully plaited it in sections, slowly and carefully cut it, and then tripled checked to make sure the sides matched, while asking me if everything looked good. i would definitely go back. extremely reasonable price allows for well-earned tip. great location on mill ave. and very close to asu tempe campus."
"just left the shop and i am so happy i chose to walk in today. this was my first visit to the salon, as well as my first haircut from a new stylist in years. i was not really sure what i wanted, but i had a very talented stylist named joy who knew just how to cut my hair! i am so excited about my new haircut, and i am so impressed by the quality of service i received in such a short visit. my usual haircuts can take as long as two hours, but joy was very knowledgeable about my hair type and i was able to get an excellent cut in under half an hour. it is worth noting again that the haircut was amazing and i am loving my new do! i will definitely be back for another haircut soon."
if you want the best haircut please go see melissa....she is awesome and she always does an amazing job.
just left this place and i have to say that the lady who cut my hair was the rudest most unpleasant ever!!! its ok though because she saved me 6 bucks in tip.
"i've been getting my hair cut at great clips for some time. they're cheap and usually do a good job. one thing that has always bothered me however, is their massive indoor air pollution problem. the second you step into the place, you're assaulted by the nauseating, concentrated odor of toxic hair chemicals in their air. it smells like someone just emptied the major part of a hairspray bottle into the air.great clips seems to have no effective or no air filtration system at all. i think what they're spraying just gets recycled through the ac. this is true for all their locations in tempe, not just the one at mill and southern.for people with allergies and asthma like myself, this is no small problem, and today i've decided that i've had enough, and will no longer be a great clips customer. i instead got my hair cut at keep it cut at rural and baseline, where the air is actually breathable."
i always get the results i want here.  melisa always does a great job!  they greet me with a smile and welcome when i walk in.  i recommend them to my family and they all come to this location.
"this place is hit or miss.  i would never have my hair cut at a great clips (i have naturally curly hair, but even if i didn't....no, sorry) so this may skew my review a bit, simply because i have never seen quality work consistently come out of any great clips and would never trust them with my hair.  my husband, on the other hand, favors this place only because they are cheap.  his hair grows quickly, so if he doesn't like it, it won't matter in a few days anyway.  i keep trying to talk him out of going there every time and spend money on a place that will actually do a good job, but he insists on going back because he refuses to spend $10 more.  there was one young lady who is impossibly thin (i didn't catch her name.  she has big pretty eyes and is very thin) that cut his hair and did an absolutely terrible job.  every time he looked in the mirror, my totally not self-conscious husband would say ""worst haircut ever.  that chick messed my hair up.""  if he complains, it's bad."
"okay, this is a long story...but joy is amazing! go this location of great clips and ask for joy. she is 100% amazing in every aspect. first off, she's beyond friendly and cares about every person that steps in her salon. she realizes that haircuts are important to people and ultimately illustrates how they personally see themselves. long story short, i had my haircut done a while back and i knew what i wanted, but i did not have someone near as great as joy. i felt very unhappy about my experience and knew right away i needed to go back to joy. i showed her a pic of what i wanted done and she went above and beyond my expectations. i feel so more confident and back on the top after seeing her. one million percent, got to joy! thanks joy and great clips! mill and southern location"
"asked for a low fade, got a high fade. looks like i'm about to re-enlist now. the haircut was clean and no uneven lines. just not at all what i asked for. staff was friendly, checked in online and wait was only a couple minutes."
"i've gone to several great clips locations, and have had great experiences-- this was not one of them. i went in today asking for a half inch trim-- the first thing my stylist does is try to get me to buy some product. i respectfully listen, but she spends more time talking about the product, rather than focusing on my hair. i had to point out that she left half of my hair untrimmed and longer than the rest. she didn't even check my part, did a half-assed job, and continued to talk about buying the product. some advice-- please don't spend the whole appointment trying to get customers to buy product while paying little to no attention to the actual haircut. i will never be returning to this location again."
"never had any problems with this location. like all great clips you're really rolling the dice if you decide to walk in and expect a quick haircut. wait times can get long quickly, so always check in online or with the mobile app. in my experience great clips can be hit or miss from location to location and this is definitely one of the better ones. i'll drive several miles out of my way and past other locations to get my haircut at this location. i always seem to regret it when i don't."
"stephan went above and beyond. he took the time to discuss what i wanted, and made excellent suggestions. the result of my visit was the best haircut of my life, and for only $8 (during the sale). i wasn't sure what i wanted, but afterwards ended up with something i didn't know i could have asked for. highly recommended. stephan is my new spirit animal."
been here twice since living in tempe and im just gonna say i rather get my hair cut here than a fancy salon. every time i come here to get a hair cut they always leave my hair looking great. i just got it cut about three weeks ago and the person who cut my hair was amazing. he asked me how i liked to style it and even added personal touches the style i asked for.i cant remember his name but i will go back to him when i need a trim.
i just had my hair cut my michael at the great clips on mill. he did a great job and was super professional. he definitely understands how to cut short hair for women!
"of course it depends on who you get, but my husband and i deal with the best at this salon. daisy sure knows how to work a cute short hair do. i am far from being a picky person about my hair, but i did have something in mind. and she did a perfect cut. everyone loves my hair. i went from long to short. thanks daisy! now my husband goes to heather and has been going to her for years. i love this team of ladies cause they sure make us both look good. ;)"
"i've been a returning customer of great clips consistently for about 2 years for a reason. when looking for a hair cut i like to be in and out and their online check in makes that possible, love walking in and skipping ahead of everyone waiting!  also i went here to get my hair styled for my engagement pictures and daisy did a wonderful job!  who knew?!"
great place !!!! bonnie was amazing!!! def would go back!!! very clean and professional !!!!and fast !!!
"i have been coming to this great clips for over 3 years, before, i was going to the great clips on 24th street and baseline for bridgette. when she moved stores, i decided to make that extra commute to get my hair cut by her. i highly recommend asking for bridgette, she has spent time perfecting her skills. bridgette have been going beyond my expectations of great clips and this is the only reason why i go to this location. please give her a try, she will spend time learning about you, instead of the typical 15 minutes haircut where you are left feeling awkward wondering who cut your hair. you won't be disappointed!"
"hey i goto great clips all the time - in fact the same person just recently cut my hair for when i asked my girlfriends parents for their daughter's hand, for my engagement, for my wedding and fixed what the wife tried to do.  always very kind, relaxing experience. and always a good haircut."
"i have gone here several times to get a men's hair cut here, nothing complicated. however, the two times i have had my hair cut by the older woman i have ended up with an awful hair cut. after getting home and showering, the top of my head was left at the same length it was before (about an inch difference) and the angles from the transitions on the sides of my head were completely different.if you go here, get one of the younger ladies to cut your hair, they are more competent and i've never had issues with their work."
"walked in about 2 weeks ago, only had to wait 10 minutes.was lucky & got sandra, she did a fantastic job & knew what needed to be trimmed to get style i wanted before i even asked. turns out we had a lot in common & loved talking with her! she did a great haircut & am definitely going back to her in future!"
came to get a haircut at this location and left with uneven hair. the stylist didn't seem to know what he was doing at all. i immediately went to the great clips at hayden plaza and they did a wonderful job and didn't even charge me since my hair looked terrible. i decided to come back to get a refund and was told they wouldn't do that because i should've had it re-done at the location that did a terrible job on my hair. i wouldn't recommend coming here.
"i checked in online at this location on a saturday afternoon. there was no wait and i only needed my hair shampooed and blow dried. when i arrived, there was only one customer at a station and 3 other stylists without clients. when i requested my service, the manager said, no - only hair cuts today! whaaaat? i thought it was a joke, but was quickly informed that it was not. they would not shampoo and dry or style my hair because they did not have ""enough stylists on the floor"" * possibly the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard of! * absolutely the poorest customer service i have ever had at a great clips! or anywhere actually i went to my car and drove to the great clips at squaw peak plaza on 16th st where i was greeted by susan. this location appeared to be busy and only had 2 stylists on the floor. susan did not bat an eye and was happy to have me as her customer. she did a fantastic job and was a pleasure to work with! i would encourage you to save yourself the trip and aggravation and skip great clips located at 4312 e. cactus in phoenix and head straight over to the great clips at 6825 n 16th st, phoenix.  you will receive much better service and enjoy the experience. i wish i could let the cactus store know that i bought $100 worth of product and tipped 25%. just sayin'"
"i was a walk in.  started my experience with two hairstylist debating (in front of me during check-in) on who had the right to do the cut. guess i should have walked out right then!  explain to the hairstylist over 3 times- how my hair needed to stay in a ponytail (rubber); since it was going to be donated.  3-5 times later she finally paid attention/understood; after removing the river band and trying to come out the hair. never had clippers used to shave off a ponytail before. will never have it done again!! nora don't understand how a hairdresser, does not realize wet here is one length compared to dry hair.  besides-the underneath/back hair is now shorter than the top/sides. also-ended up being shorter than what i request.  since the ponytail was not cut straight, the stylist had to trim it up. again-too short!!!!will not return to that stylist, maybe even that location. beware before you sit down!!!!"
took my 4 year old son in this evening. we did the mobile check in which worked out perfectly. wade cut my son's hair and did a good job! he knew what to do & was good with talking to my son. enjoyable experience! thank you!
always bring my grandchildren here. great cut and very reasonable prices would recommend this place for good hair cuts.
"the national weather service issued excessive heat warning's for sunday and monday saying that temperatures on the sidewalks and streets could get up to 170°   right now great clips has this man working on a street corner. on a day where people are supposed to avoid going outside if possible is it really necessary to put an older gentlemans health at risk by having him stand out in this for hours?the city of phoenix and churches are setting up shelters and the power company is putting on extra workers to make sure everybody has air. considering all of this, wouldn't it behoove the company to think of a persons health before advertising that may not even bring in more income?"
"two bad experiences with chelsey. first time she told me i was second in line when i was was fifth. today she argued with me about my cut/style. she spent maybe 5 minutes on the cut. its uneven and the worst i've ever had. she pressed the clippers in to my neck, leaving burns and red streaks. this person has no business working with the public and should never be allowed near a salon. i called the customer comment line and the box was full. obviously, i won't be back."
"i've come to this location for years as has my family. they have several good stylists. but the fact that the owner, randy, won't  fix the hot water heater is absurd. it's been broken for months!!! so do not ask for a shampoo unless you want to have a shampoo with very cold water. everyone's shampoos should be free until this is corrected. he owns multiple locations and this is ridiculous that he is making both his customers and employees suffer through cold water. stop being cheap!!!"
"horrible service. i came in for a blow dry and it looked like the stylist definitely did not know what she was doing. normally, it would take close to 45 mins to do a decent job. i was there for one and a half hour with absolutely no results. she even asked her colleague to help and she tried to style my hair completely straight. on being asked for feedback, when i politely said this isn't what i was expecting...she snapped back at me saying i should know the weather is humid. the lady was extremely rude and i think it was a total rip off. i would never go there again and stay away from such unpleasant staff."
ask for chelsey especially if you have a child with autism or special needs. she's been cutting my hair since she was 18 and is the only one who can cut my sons hair. she's got a great sense of style.
"hands down, the worst experience i have ever had with getting a haircut.  i live between two great clips of about equal distance so i alternate back and forth.  the notes are the same, as i get the same boring, and very easy haircut.  i have been getting the same cut since about 2009.  yesterday, i knew i was in trouble when i had to explain 3-4 times what the notes meant before the guy even started.  i understand that new people start, but they need to have their skills tested before hacking up customers.  the guy just couldn't understand what i was telling him, it was a joke.  other stylists could see what was going on, and one even tried to come over and help.  i think that others seeing how bad he was doing and not intervening made the situation worse.i finally just told him to stop, i couldn't take any more.  i will get it fixed elsewhere.  he really didn't understand he was doing so bad.  the same girl that tried to help came and told him to apologize to me and offer me some product.  he made some half assed apology, truly not understanding there was an issue, and then offered 50% off one little bottle of shampoo.  he also couldn't figure out how to ring me out.  i just gave money and left, again, there was no way i was waiting around there any longer.  too bad, i usually get really good treatment here, but i won't ever go back now."
ask for jeniffer. she pays attention to detail and make your hair look the way you want. she did a really good job
"it seems that the person cutting hair does not listen. as a female, i am given a man's cut.as i am waiting, i have seen more time taken cutting a man's hair. my last visit maria hadno regard for my request. uneven cut. i will find another shop that will listen to my request.you can't grow hair back after the damage has been done."
"i love this place. in and out quick. the staff is really friendly. ask for chad, a master at work:)"
"i take my children to great clips.  on this particular visit, we arrived around 8pm, and were informed of a short wait.  we waited about 10 minutes before the first daughter was called back for her wash and cut.within another 10 minutes, the other daughter went back.  both were given personalized attention and enjoyed the scalp massage with the shampoo.both haircuts came out fine, symmetrical, etc.  friendly and efficient hair cutters.  price for 2 cuts, including shampoo and tip:  $34.00  ~~ and the girls were happy with the results.we will return to this location."
been getting my hair cut by one of the girls here for years.   jennifer does a great  job.   i love her.
"i called this location to see what their wait time was and the woman who answered, angie, informed me that there was no one there and to come in. i asked to put my name in and she stayed that it wasn't necessary. i asked her again and she insisted that i didn't need to. i drove the 4 minute drive from my location to this great clips and when i arrived every seat was full and there was a 35 minute wait. i mentioned that i had just spoke with someone and asked to put my name in and every person acted oblivious. no apology whatsoever, horrible customer service."
"not so great clip.... from my experience.  i'm not going to write a book about it, but the service is okay, the workers are disgruntled (bad ownership from what they said), but my biggest pet-peeve, the stations are covered with hair and they didn't clean up prior to me being seated.  i had to ask her to clean up."
"non-existent customer service. quite literally. i walk up to the desk, the guy working there ignores up - i'm standing at the counter inches from where he just finished ringing up a customer - when i get to the counter, he turns away from me and walks away. walks. away. from. a. customer. like i have cooties or  something. wtf? i'll go elsewhere for my haircut."
"i've been coming to this great clips for several years for haircuts. they're quick and pretty much always do a good job. sure, i've had a person every now and then that wasn't all that great, but i've never had anyone completely butcher my hair. all the hairdressers are friendly.i always check in on the app when i come in (they don't take reservations) and i never have to wait more than about 10 mins when i arrive. at $14 a haircut they're pretty reasonable to begin with, but they offer deals a few times throughout the year & are always mailing out coupons."
"very nice people, clean and professional. get a decent haircut for a decent price and don't spend all day in the salon."
"they are always in a rush to finish my haircut within ten minutes. every single time they fail to cut my hair how i ask them.  i ask them for a fade, they cut it all one length. i ask them for a disconnect, they literally just didnt do it then insisted they did. cuts have been uneven and sloppy, consistently!  i have gone to a different person each time snd still get terrible service. the customer service and professionalism just isnt there. on top of that i have always been a great tipper.  i have tipped between 30% and 50 % for sub par results.  i have gone here about 100 times in the past few years but this time is definitely my last."
"juanita was amazing. i apologize for not remembering the lady who was going to do my hair. but, i give her kudos for admitting she was hesitant about doing my hair. i have a lotttt so i don't blame her. juanita stepped up and did fabulous! before and after"
this place is terrible. the only positive is that it opens early on the weekends for morning birds like me but i will never come back to this place because of the terrible cut i got.
"coleen had good reviews.. took a chance.. i said to her if she knew how to cut the style i wanted, said was familiar.. said she was a stylist for 9 years.  did the typical men's cut as they are known for.. uneven cut, 1/2inch on the top..never ever to to any great clips again.. does great job on men's hair..did not check in on web site... i had 3 people ahead of me. waited well over a hour..."
"giving 3 stars here kind of sucks for me. i am torn. i do like a lot of the stylists i have used. i just had one situation where i felt like they pushed product on me and then when i went to return it the return policy is that they send you a check in the mail 4-6 weeks later......whaaat? how about i paid with a credit card, put it back on that.i'll be back, but only for a cut:)"
"just had the best haircut experience of my life thanks to bailey. i am 57 with frizzy blonde hair. she cut and styled it too look like something out of a magazine. she did the styling part while i was turned to the side, so i wasn't sure what i was going to see when spun around. i literally dropped my jaw when she turned me to look at my hair. she is very talented and i had no idea my hair could look so great. plus she is great fun to talk to.!"
they did a great job not sure why ppl are blasting them on yelp specially if your going to a wedding and you talk about how great your hair is
just got a cut from gabriella and she did a fantastic job. she actually listens and follows through with a great cut. i love it thank you gabriella! i will be back
"wow i cannot even believe this place. words can not even express my anger. i went in to get a little trim 2 months before my wedding i was not looking for a new look i was just wanting a little maintenance. my hair stylist knew my goals. i have a long beautiful hair that goes all the way down my back and jeffrey took it upon himself to chop off 5 inches and cropped it just below my shoulders. i am devisisted. i should have known just from looking at him that i was gonna be in trouble. never trust a hairdresser that has a funky haircut. they all think they're artist and they all think they know best & do whatever they want even if you don't agree with it. i took my concern to the manager colleen but she treated me even worse. she was completely condescending and rude. ""yes mrs, i will refund your $14"" even though i spend $100 on the service and no amount of money can buy me my hair back before my big day."
i came here with average expectations but needed a haircut fast.  i waited less than 15 minutes and florentina was my stylist.  she was amazing.  my hair was a mess and i showed her a photo of the style i wanted and it was exactly the same as the photo.  would definitely come back!  the price is great too!
just needed a trim and bailey was quick and efficient. also gave me tips for my dry scalp. thank you!!
i've been coming here for about a year now and i'm always happy with their quality of work and professional.  flo gave my son and i excellent hair cut on wednesday.  we will both be sure to request her in the future.
"went in on a recommendation from someone whose haircut i complimented, and i'm so glad i did! lance did a great job of cutting off my shoulder length hair...love my new pixie cut. (i was also observing flo and she looks very good as well.)"
"if you've never been to a great clips, be sure to get someone's attention before assuming your in line by sitting down, like any other barbershop.after waiting 15 minutes, i realized you have to sign up with your phone and address before your ""in line"".so after doing so, they decide to help someone who came in after me. walked out. never going to this chain clip shop again."
"my hair cut is great! down side? my hair stylist was very aggressive. she shampooed and conditioned my hair, it felt as i if she was trying to rip my scalp off then wash my hair....."
"fast, friendly and affordable. i have thick hair that's layered and juanita always does a great job and my hair moves & falls just right. ray used to cut my hair but he's no longer there, he did magic with his shears! i love the online check in! they always cut your hair exactly as you asked. highly recommend!!"
i am back in az and need my hair cut...three weeks ago.  danielle did such a fabulous haircut for me that i decided to wait it out.  i want my hair cut today but i will have to wait until tomorrow because she is not in today. hope she has a great day off and stays cool!
"need a quick haircut? stop by and someone will seat you within minutes. i always ask for the manager, colleen because she does a great job.i just read youri's comment about the app and looked it up on my phone. the app is called great clips online check in. use it to add your name to the list so that you have the chance of being next when you arrive. love it!"
"i really only get my hair cut once a year, but everytime i come here they're incredibly friendly. prices aren't bad, standard of your chain hair salons."
this place is very conveniently located to me so i've gone there a few times since they've opened.  they seem to have a high rate of employee turnover there so it's hard to get the same person more than once.  i've also had to go to another location to get my cut fixed on two separate occasions.
i checked in on line and when i walked in i was 1 on the screen. a man was checking in in person so he was 2 on the screen. adela tells me that the man was next since he checked in before me (the screen clearly showed him as 2). so what's the point of the on line check in if it's not being followed. very upsetting and she obviously doesn't know how to read a screen!
"just returned from a first time visit to great clips on nacogdoches where my sister and i both dropped in for a cut.  having recently moved from oregon where the same person cut my hair for the last 10 years, i was nervous about trying out someone new.  relax!  lane was my stylist and he gave me as good a cut as i ever received in my nyc days or my portland, or days!  i was absolutely thrilled with the job he did and made sure that he knew that both verbally and with a tip.  similarly, my sister was exceptionally happy with the job jennifer did on her.  recognizing that hair stylists may come and go with uncommon frequency, i would proudly recommend lane to anyone looking for a professional experience at an unbelievably reasonable cost.  thank you lane!  will see you soon."
"great place, great staff, great haircut ! definitely coming back ! the staff listened to what i wanted and the wait was low."
went there to get a haircut saw they informed me the wait would be awhile.i had to be on the way to work in a hour.left to stop and get something at another store thought to myself okay i killed some time let me go back and see how it looks.i would be next up great so i waited.was informed the manager would be doing my haircut.she was sweeping and cleaning up got on her phone and just kept talking.i was checking the time getting impatient.the manager knew i was waiting she saw me.another employee saw i was in a rush let her know my situation looked at the manager and the manager said she was having a crisis.and walked off.i left she lost a customer who would go there as well as my kids will never go back there again.
14 bucks for a men's haircut and i was in and out in less than 20 minutes on a friday afternoon... the heb kiddy corner from it also offers coupons for 9 dollar haircuts on the back of the receipts... nice staff as well latoya was very professional and new how to cut my hair on my first visit!
went next door for dunkin donuts. then for hair cuts. very convenient and easy to get in and out.
"usually this location does a good job. today i had one of the worst haircuts i've had in years.  it started off as a trim but she kept cutting until it left my hair a way-too-short chopped-up mess. yes, the price is reasonable, but i'm not sure i'll ever ask for n----- to cut my hair again."
"i had some good haircuts there befor, but this time the stylist  just did want she wanted . good location  but i'm  not coming back i told her don't cut the front, only thr back . i  walked out with a short front.just not happy with cindy,she is probably  a good barbor."
i have been to this great clips about 4 times.  my last two hair cut were done by alicia.  great job!  she does a wonderful job!
"got a little clean up done today by joe, dude did awesome! i usually (like every time) hate getting hair cuts and am pretty disappointed after wards, but leaving this visit i was extremely satisfied and happy with the outcome.  thanks joe!"
"the only reason i'm not leaving one star is because they have online check-in(which is pretty nifty) and he did, in fact, cut my hair. which is what i paid for(however begrudgingly). my barber did not do anything that i asked for. all i wanted was a simple harcut, fade from the bottom to the top and then longer on the top. this is not what i received. he cut one side longer than the other, none of it is even, my bangs are all messed up, and i was not given the shampooing that i asked for. i am very displeased and i will not be coming back, i will also be recommending against great clips in the future. thank you for the waste of money."
"sadly my previous stylist has left and the review has no more merit and the last few times have not gone so well... and then the most recent time i took my son for a visit clean up, half of his sideburn was cut diagonal in the wrong direction and super short, plus i had to go home and clean up the mess she left from using the thinning scissors without going over to clean up long uneven strands sticking out. i was tending to my toddler while he got his haircut and the stylist didn't even tell me. i noticed when we got tot he car... i'm not looking for amazing (which i actually got from a couple of stylist who used to work her) but not really bad can't be too much to ask. looks like i'm going to have to find a new place that can deliver some consistency"
i have never been so rudely greeted by the barbers at this location which is the one i go to so often! i went in for a neck trim-when my grandkids and i walked in one of the ladies stated all these people are here and only one hair cut!! rude and unprofessional! i will prolly start going down the road to the helotes location if this is the way we will be treated
"an inch is not 2 inches. i asked for a trim with no more than an inch removed. as the ""stylist"" began trimming she started on the back and cut  2 1/2 inches off. i just sat there stunned. at this point what can i say or do?  i know it's just hair but crap. i'm on vacation in san antonio for 7 weeks and i just needed a quick trim because i was going to the beach. i have a hair stylist in my hometown of reynoldsburg, ohio that i've been going to for 20+ years.  i'm was planning on going to her when i get home.  my advice, don't patronize this place unless you don't mind a hack job.  only reason i gave it a 2 star was because they have an online sign in."
"i usually go to this place and always have someone different cut my hair.  i prefer to be in and out. with that said, i trust all the staff to cut my hair as i like it, without any long waiting time."
"i do not give out my cell number because of privacy. i went to this location for a trim and when i politely refused to give my cell number the girl promptly said ""someone else can deal with this"" and walked away from the counter. i asked if they are refusing to cut my hair she said no but turned around and walked away. i can't believe a business would turn down my hard earned dollars over a phone number. rude, embarrassing, frustrating and a total waste of my time."
"this is your standard great clips, maybe a step above some of the ones you'll find in san antonio. the staff is all friendly and nice and i was pleased with the way the woman did my hair. the only complaint i have is the wait time. i went on two different occassions and the wait was about 20 or 30 minutes... not unbearable, but not fun. i have two great clips i could go to and this is the one i choose because it is nicer than the other option. i recommend."
"i just had a horrible experience at your bandera pointe location (1215hrs on 8/18/2014) in san antonio texas. a little history my son is less than a year old and he has already had five haircuts all at this location. all of our previous experiences has been wonderful the stylists have been patient and have done a great job at cutting my infant sons hair.today upon walking into the great clips store we didn't receive much of a welcoming greeting from the stylist that was about to cut my sons hair. as i sat down and placed my son in my lap the stylist began wetting down his hair as she started to cut i could tell that she was having a bad day or had little experience cutting children's hair by the look of frustration upon her face. after getting upset with me and my son twice because i refuse to force an infant not to move a little i got up and departed the location. after leaving the bandera pointe location my son and i proceeded to the huebner commons location here in san antonio where we where professionally greeted and i have to say dinorah who cut my sons hair did a wonderful job. i regret to say i didn't get the name of the lady at the bandera pointe store, but can describe her as an older red headed lady who's station if you were to walk in the front door is the first one on the left. i'm sorry if she was having a bad day, but her lack of professionalism will result in me advising other parents of small children to refrain from doing further business at that location."
"i have been coming to this location for years,  i will be finding somewhere else going forward.  i got a bad haircut,  i can deal with that,  going back and getting a refund to be barked at and insulted by the guy who cut my hair is unacceptable.  having the manager recognize my bad haircut,  listen to her employee be extremely rude and not even apologize?! go anywhere else,  you'll thank yourself."
"this place cut my hair so bad. i literally begged the older lady that helped me to only take off the very tips of my hair.. i started off asking for only a half inch to be cut; she told me she would have to trim a little more than that. basically she kept working me up the length she was going to cut it. she asked to cut 2 1/2 inches. i literally begged her to only trim 1 1/2. i was so obviously uncomfortable and felt like now that she had the scissors in her hands it wasn't really important what i wanted. i was right too, she ended up cutting a total of 4 inches off of my hair! literally! yeah yeah it's just hair and it grows back.. but hair is really important to girls, especially me.. anyway i shed a few tears over it lol. i had hair that touched my hips. now it barely covers my chest.. yeah.. that's fucked up. i spent years growing it out and she just chopped it into a generic medium length cut even after i begged her and showed her pics. anyway you get the point. i'm pissed."
"i was so glad when this location opened!  close to home. as most great clips i've been to, clean, cool, and friendly peeps. a few have been here since opening but then again...  i typically don't come on the same days of the week. if you haven't yet, download the app and check in online. makes life easy when you arrive and also gives you a heads up on the wait."
"haircuts can be expensive. ok now that i got captain obvious out of the way, great clips crosses a line.when they first started, haircuts were $8, then went up to $9...then $12...currently $14.now i can live with inflation...however...normally, i request a rinse after a haircut so i am not shedding clippings all day, and not itching either, and normally they give me a rinse.the last two times i went in, they refused the rinse because the manager or owner said that since it's not a regular menu service, they won't do it.  i went back after the first time thinking that was a one time thing, but nope... it's a thing. so they made me get a $4 shampoo in order to get rinsed. that effectively took the haircut up to $18, then tip took it over $23.now, for that price, i could go to the good barber or any sports clips and get a shampoo, hot towel, and neck and shoulder massage, and free neck trim between haircuts.  so basically, if i am forced to pay that amount, why bother to go to great clips at all if they offer less of a service? no brainer. i know, right!? i complained to corporate and they said they would contact the owner who, not surprisingly, never bothered to call me back.summary: for the most bang for the buck, great clips is totally not worth it. their menu reasoning is stupid. if you follow that reason, there are dozens of things that aren't in the service menu that they do anyway but shouldn't, right? until they change that a-hole policy, i won't go back. too bad for the employees, and it isn't their fault.still no word from the owner. the stylists are really cool here...the owner doesn't care one bit about you"
if you're going to stop in here first check in online.  they get very busy and the wait can be long.  second when you get there ask for christine!  she is the only one who has been able to cut my hair the same visit after visit and she's great with my girls who have very curly hair!  i can't say we've had all the other stylists but a few and it wasn't great.  so my stars are for christine!
"i recently moved to san antonio and have been missing my hair stylist in va who knew exactly how to cut and style my hair.1. have gotten my hair cut here a total of 3 times. first time the stylist did a great job. she normally does not work at this salon but, was there helping out. 2. went in for a trim a month or so later.  new person not the same person i had the first time the girl butchered my hair. i came home and washed and blew dried it out and my hair was unevenly cut. long strands here and there. it was terrible. one side longer than the other. how do you do this especially if you are supposedly professionally trained. 3. called great clips and they said i could come in and get my hair fixed for free. (they call it a redo) 4. luckily for me i got the first stylist and she fixed my hair and did a great job. i wish she was there permanently. seems like she is the only one that can cut hair. have not gone back since."
"had a truly wonderful experience with ms. victoria! i have a regular hairstylist who does my color & she is wonderful, however i can no longer afford the $55 & up for a hair trim/cut. a friend referred me to victoria at this great clips location. i admit, i had pretty low expectations but i was blown away! victoria was very sweet & quick yet precise. i have to say this was one of the best haircuts i have ever had!!"
"they do a very bad job in this place. i have three boys that get haircuts and the only person that does a good job are nancy and the gentlemen that i can not remember his name. everyone else does a very poor job. i usually do not provide reviews, however, i gave up on this place because most of the hair stylists do an awful job. to bad because the place is very close to where i live."
this place is terrible. it have constantly given them chances and they always screw up. i always come out looking worse than i could imagine. it's just this great clips. the people that work their are just terrible at cutting hair. i will never consider going to a great clips again. they are the worst.
"came to see yvette on my sister's recommendation and was not disappointed! she listened to what i wanted and understood my hairs texture and weight immediately. she suggested a few modifications to what i described, and my hair turned out great! love how the computer keeps track of how many visits to a discount, so there's no loyalty card to lose. this location is a little out of my way, but i will definitely be back!"
great experience!  checked in online and glad i did.  went on a monday night and it was super busy.  the wait online said 38 minutes but when i got there 10 peeps had their name put in.  3 stylists there so i figured it would go by fast.  i was right.  i didn't wait more than 10 minutes.  nancy was friendly and listened while i told her and showed her what i wanted.  it didn't take her more than 15 minutes to get what i wanted.  $13.  great deal.  will be back.
"the worst.. hair came out lopsided and all i asked for was a 2"" cut, nothing fancy. lupe was the hair cutter."
i came to this great clips for a spur of the moment trim and i'm so glad that i did. i too had yvonne and she was wonderful. she was super nice and friendly but didn't force awkward small talk like some stylists do. she also gave me suggestions when i asked but was not overly pushy with them. she did an incredible job and i will definitely be back to see her!
"i've been going here since the place opened. never ever had a bad cut. sometimes (extremely rare)  i'll get a cut that's not spectacular but still decent, but 9.9 out of 10 times i'll get exactly what i want and it looks amazing. even on their busiest days they take the time to ask all the right questions and check with you through the process. i've probably seen 8 or 10 different stylists there and they get it right. today i went and saw vanessa. it was busy but she took time, went above and beyond. in my opinion she stands out among the place. very good at what she does. i've gone to her twice now and both times did exactly the same thing going above and beyond what i asked for. i can totally tell she loves what she does. i won't be surprised when i find out she gets her own place. you'll be amazed no matter who cuts your hair but if you get vanessa, you'll see what i mean"
"i got out of my vehicle and checked my 14 year old son in for a hair cut an hour before closing.  i ran an errand accross the street.  i text my son i am omw and he responds that ""the lady will not cut my hair because a parent is not here"":(  i rush to great clips and get there 10 min before closing.  i ask my son if he likes his hair cut and he says no.  the lady was rushing.  now i have to pay again to fix this rush job.  another point is they have notes on the type of style of hair cut each member of my family likes so i do not know what the problem was.  not like my son needed to sit on my lap so i can make him stay still.  better yet, ask my son how he likes his hair cut.respectfully, dissatisfied customer"
"wish i could give zero stars. rude, rude, rude employees.  we checked in online, it was extremely busy when we got there.  three different employees were very rude to us: all before we even got checked in at the counter.  my husband asked me a rhetorical question, what is going on (as in why is it so busy).  several (4 or 5) were standing at the counter in spite of the volume of customers.  one sarcastically and loudly said, ""its back to school, that's what's going on"", in a tone that was very condescending.  meanwhile, another employee asked if we checked in online, i confirmed.  she asked for the name, i gave the last name.  she snapped at me and said ""names, names, i need the names of everyone getting their haircut""...there were 3 of us).  then when referring to my daughter (who is told by everyone she is model material), she referred to her as ""him"", which i believe was done on purpose.  lastly, when the ""names!"" girl was asking names and spellings i confirmed her questions with ""yep"" instead of yes... which prompted a third girl (who was picking her fingernails and manually scraping chipped polish off while standing at the counter)to loudly mock me.  are you kidding?  unprofessional all around.  we turned around and left and never, i mean never going back."
"worst haircut ever, i wish i could give this place a zero star. she was rushing with hair cut, she finished with in 10 mins. horrible customer service. i gave this place a second chance and they fucked it up once again. would never recommended to anyone. stay away from this place to save your time and money."
"don't go, unless you're in basic training. actually, still don't go. places like these will lure people in because they're fast and cheap, but let me tell you they're gonna butcher it. avoid this establishment like the plague!!!"
"disorganized system of checking in clients that literally skipped over my husband who checked in online. as we waited in the shop we saw my husbands name go up the screen to number 1 and after that other clients went ahead of him and not one stylist there bothered to call out his name. the receptionist was not where she was supposed to be to validate check in so the system for online check in is completely useless. the manager was ""on vacation"" so of course there was  no one we could lodge a complaint with. never going back to this location. i feel that if you have an online check in system for your clients that come in for service that system should be used better."
"i had a lot of anxiety before coming here. i can say all that was eased by melissa, she was so awesome and patient with me. she knows how to frame a face and i appreciate the time she took on me. i got in line online and only waited 15 mins to be seen. melissa is a total professional and i recommend her to anybody who's thinking about going. i like that they aren't pushy and don't try to up-sell."
horrible.  stylist was getting ready to take my child when someone else walked in and was helped right away because they checked in on line.  the whole process was horrible as nothing was explained to me.  i saw her getting set up for a four year old and then she tosses the booster aside and helps someone else without a word to me.  won't ever be back.  customer service goes a long way.
"i'm fairly specific as to how i want my hair cut, i had gone to great clips last month and my stylist did a fantastic job.  however, i went in this morning and the experience was ridiculous.  after signing in on-line with no wait (that's nice), i asked the stylist assigned to me (christina) to provide the following:1. a number two clipper tapered to in line just below my temple (holds hands to demonstrate position).  2.from that point, my remaining hair should be the same length -- with approximately 1/2"" to be cut.  that makes a sharp transition, not a gradual taper above the line i specified.  i can't have that or my hair will appear to spike between the taper and the top -- which i hate.3. i reiterated that i wore my hair exactly as i was wearing it when i walked in, so it should be symmetrical. i told her that like the sides of my hair to hang slightly over the taper and then demonstrated by pulling my hair on both sides and letting it drop over the sides.christina said, ""no problem"" and then started the taper.  she started off fine, the usual banter,  and confirmed the top length before cutting.  then she started blending the taper into the rest of my hair...,wait, what? halfway through the clearly uneven cut, she says -- ""do you comb it to the side?"" ""uh, no -- i wear exactly as i did when i walked in.""  however, i can't do that any more because of the chop job she did.  the taper was uneven on both sides and carried higher than i requested, i tell her as much to which she replies, ""well, i think it looks good."" i disagreed and she says: ""no, it looks real good, you should wear it like that."" i respond with, ""well, i guess i've got no choice really.""  here's some advice: your opinion of what the haircut looks like is not as important as delivering the haircut i requested.  i suppose some of these stylists are capable of a single haircut and that's what you're going to get when you walk in.she then asks, ""is there anything else you want me to do?""  from the customer perspective, that's a nonsensical question.  you didn't do what i asked you to do the first time so why would i bother providing additional instructions.  however, as a glutton for bad hair styles, i tell her we'll have to continue the taper and take more length off the top or it's going to be difficult to style.  she tells me again that it looks good.  nice.  i told her i was done and walked out at 9:39 am  with what can only be described as the worst haircut i've ever received.  but hey, christina liked it, so i guess that's all that matters.    bottom line, i've had a great stylist (i think she was a manager -- she was awesome) and one that ignored everything i said.  unfortunately in business you're only as strong as your weakest staff member.  so, one star."
"horrible experience... walked in friday morning at 10am with my morning coffee and my fiance. i sat down to wait for him in the waiting area and was told by a woman who was vigorously tapping a handwritten sign by the register no drink allowed. i asked since i was just sitting in the lobby if that was ok and all 3 of the employees now at the register stated in unison, no it's not allowed. needless to say we walked out and he went elsewhere. i understand kids, spills, cleanup, etc. but a grown woman with a lidded coffee??"
went in for the first time and got a hair cut within 5 minutes. samantha was my stylist and she was great. she talked most of the time and seemed to like her job. she was very tentative to styling my hair and to asked if i was happy with it so far and what she needed to do to it. will be going back. *update* i have been to this location for over a year now and go every 3-4 weeks. they have quite a bit of turn over but all the girls they get are good and always a good cut. enjoy!
"the online check-in is a great plus for this place. it's always very busy, so that's a good sign that they do well. they are in line with pricing. just wish they would keep the personal banter to a minimum. it can get very sexually vulgar with these ladies. keep in mind if you bring kids."
"totally messed up mine and my sons  hair! from out of town and i saw good reviews, went and was very disappointed. have a wedding to go to and have to make due with what i have. never coming here again when i'm in town. rather let it grow out."
"with all the commutable illnesses that can be contracted, the service industry needs to be on high alert regarding cleanliness. i walked into this place with hair balls in the carpeted area. the ""stylists"" work area was covered in hair and her scissors were covered in the last person's (or others before) hair. when i asked if she had other clean scissors. she stopped what she was doing (about to cut my hair with dirty scissors) and cleaned them off with barbacide (sp?) and a dirty towel. sorry but i will not be going back there again. one nic from a dirty clipper and you'll never know what you'll get."
the whole family had had a haircut here at some time.  they do a great job and the cut is $10 for kids and $12 for adults.  they are always courteous even when the place is packed.
got a cut by stephanie. she was great. did exactly what i wanted and made sure i didn't want any changes when she was done.
"this hair salon doesn't offer any way to sign up for their extensive wait of at least an hour and a half except for walk ins and downloading their corporate app. if you call, they are abrupt and push you off the phone. when you finally get a haircut they tell you most things are against policy and one of their stylists will use your shoulder to get the hair off you by hitting your collarbone over and over, leaving a bruise. also havjng gone multiple times there have been no repeat stylists, forcing me to have to repeat what i need to a person who won't cut it exactly the same way as my previous hair cut. overall crap, for children and never for business or military. their fades are absolute crap and will make it so you have to come back in and ask for a redo from another stylist."
"i considered giving this locations a one star review but lucked out from learning if it would earn such a review. i walked in today to see the place was busy; there were five stylists working and five people on the list before me. when i checked in the stylist was rude, expressing her frustration that i was a new customer with a groan and eye roll and she'd need to input my name and number. she was unable/unwilling to give an estimated wait time. once seated, i saw another customer walk toward the cashier after receiving a cut; his haircut was bad, the hair line on the back his neck was obviously crooked. this poor guy clearly had no clue what was going on the back of his head. i immediately got up and left.with all the other options in the area, the choice was easy for me to go down the street."
excellent service: johnny is as good as any salon barber.the sign in is a great feature!!
"we have been customers at their locations in san antonio for over twenty years.the past two years we have noticed that the stylists have changed every week.the quality of many of the new techs is pretty bad and we can never get our favorite stylist because they always transfer people from their normal locations.   unlike most hair salons, great clips does not believe you should rely on a certainperson to cut your hair. now, every time you visit great clips you take a chance on a potluck stylist and that will not work for us.  contacting the corporate office for great clips does not work. they have no control of the local owners who don't care. they just want to grow as large as they can and make lots of dough. the individual customer is of zero concern at great clips."
"don't bother coming here. use your money on more experienced stylists.  most of these girls seem straight out of school and don't do a good job at listening to what you want done and also overlook the cut they've done, because the past 3 times my son's hair always had hair peices that are long and they didn't cut or...his line was crooked and had to take him back twice.  they don't act too friendly and inviting especially the manager. i do not reccomend coming here. take your son's to a actual barber. the dudes tend to take their time and get it right unlike the females."
terrible customer service. online check in completely inaccurate.  checked in online and was quoted a 20 minute wait time. arrived 5 minutes prior to our appointment time and when we checked in we had a 25 minute wait from that point. stylists are extremely rude and do not care that your quoted wait time is grossly underestimated.  don't waste your time on the app or this mismanaged business. so many other options in ah where your business is appreciated.
"i had been going to this location for hair cuts, however today i was treated very rudely and did not get the type of service i expect. i went to check in online and was received a message stating that they were not accepting online check-ins. they showed a 56 minute wait on the website. so, i called and dominic answered the phone. i told him that i was trying to check in online and it would not let me, and he did not know why it would not let me perhaps for the length of wait time. i asked if he would check me in over the phone and he stated he could not do that it was only available online. he stated i would have to come to the location to check in. i let him know that did not make sense to me and he got a very condescending tone and said if i want to get in that is what i have to do or wait until. it does not make any sense to me that they would want me to drive in, check in, and wait for an hour sitting there. they created the check in service so their clients would not have to wait like this and i am confused on why it matters how you check in. so i let dominic know that i would find a new location to get my hair cut, for good."
they have an app for androids and iphones now. this app tells you how long the wait time is and let's you check in. if your taking the whole family you can check everyone in. so convenient and so web 2.0.got my cut by maria today. she took her time and did an excellent job.
"hit or miss depending on who is working that day. staff is friendly, ample parking, and it's great that they save info from your last visit, but the haircuts are not consistently good."
i always said i'd never get my haircut at a place like this due to my overwhelming fear of getting my hair butchered. the girls at great clips put my fears to rest. always super friendly and upbeat you can't go wrong here. great clips have saved me in a pinch and they'll do the same for you!!
"my 80-year-old father went for a haircut at this great clips recently.  five minutes after this great clips ran his credit card, which he handed to the gc employee to pay for his haircut (and tip), that card was also ""somehow"" billed for an $800 online purchase with a company we have never heard of.  and then another online purchase was made. our bank alerted us.to activity on my father's credit card because it was highly unusual for his card.   when we called this gc store, the great clips manager was of no help though.  thus, we will never go there again.  be careful of this particular store."
"even though this is convenient and we come here all the time - i was very dissappointed with the last trip.  i thought my husband was to blame every time my son came home with all of his gorgeous curly hair cut to bits.  so - i took him this time and gave specific instructions on his haircut.  did she listen to one word i said?  no!   it was awful - i will not go back and let them do that again to my five year old again!   poor kid, i think he's young enough that he won't be scarred for life.   hello - listen to your cusomers please!!!!   they got two stars because they give free lollipops after your haircut and it is fast.  (maybe fast because they don't listen and cut everyone's hair the same or however they heck they want to do it!!!!)"
"i have been using this great clips for over 2 years. i've met the owners. they had a stylist who has since moved on, i was sad, he was awesome. even styled my hair in a way that covered a defective hairline. but the last 2 times, treecey has been my stylist. wow the conversation, the attention to detail and helping me look my best. treecey is the best!!! and trust me, i need all the help i can get!!!for reasons i do not want to get in to, i have a reasonable special accommodation - not getting cuts at a certain station, this place is awesome in making us feel welcomed and valued and appreciated. treecey is really the best !!!"
"i get haircuts on a regular for military training. i decided to try this location because i was in the area and had a good experience there before. i am not one to write a bad review but when an employee gets a whole store to laugh at a customer its just not right. i was a bit hesitant to write this but i honestly have nothing good to say. i check in and get taken right away by tamber. she was the only one that didnt have people waiting for her so i guess that should have been a sign for me to not go with her. i get seated and she makes small talk, which was nice until i commented on the lenght of the top of my hair. i made a comment asking her to ""make it short on the top and that you can't really mess it up because if anything goes wrong i can just shave my head since i am military."" her response to me was ""don't judge me, remember i'm the one cutting your hair"". as soon as she said that everyone in the waiting area started laughing, including herself. i took it as her making fun of me and i felt embarrassed and humiliated in front of everyone. i'm not saying she's bad at cutting hair but she can improve her skills with her customers or maybe have a different approach because not every customer is open to being laughed at. i'm a very quiet and to myself person but i also feel like if i wanted to get laughed at i would be at a comedy club. tamber is not someone i would recommend going to. i hope no one has to endure what i did but i highly dont recommend tamber at all."
i don't like posting negative comments but....horrible service and several rude people working there.never going there again; other great clips out there that will do a better job and actually value my business; courtesy and customer service goes a long way and folks there need re-training in those key areas!
very rude employee told us they were closed at 7pm when online and in store said closing time was 8 pm we also were checked in online.the employee immediately told us in very rude tone that they were closed and demanded us to leave without an apology or any sympathy towards customer.
"i told the lady what i wanted, 4 on the sides tapered to a 0 (with the 0 being really low) she brought the zero basically up to the crown of my head on the sides and you can see perfect squares on the back taper. when i told her if she could blend it in better she said ""your head is shaped weird with bumps but i can try to make it not show"". i have never been to a barber in my entire life who has commented on any ""weird bumps"" on my head that has affected my haircut. i have been here before and enjoyed it, but this lady (lagenia is on the receipt) showed lack of understanding of what i told her i wanted and lack of skill to complete the job i paid her to do and then blamed it on me for her lack of skills. i have faith in the store but not in this women. i guess it's my fault for assuming if you can get hired you should be half decent at your job."
"walked in and two barbers free and no one waiting. purple hair lady checked me in asked if i checked in online, when i said no she told me to have a seat. waited 10 min, she got her check in and mademe wait. the either barber walked in the back room.  as i got up to leave he left too. crappy service. more concerned about corporate wait time.  ever going back, plenty of other shops in town"
got my haircut by daniel today and i know who'll be cutting my hair from now on! talk about skill he gave me a fantastic haircut and was very attentive to what i wanted done. he's a fantastic stylist!
i normally come to this great clips and it's always been awesome until today new staff and they guy that i was getting my haircut had some attitude he asked what i wanted and i said i'll get the same haircut like last since they always document notes for your next haircut nope he was having a really bad attitude and when i gave him a look of disgust he played it off by saying he was joking and the rest of the haircut went awful as i was just saying anything to get out of there and not get pissed off. the other employees saw as well and did nothing nor accommodated for it all they said was there's your total and expected a tip
"today i got my hair cut for the first time in over a year. i was really hesitant to go to great clips since the last time my hair was cut way shorter than i asked for. kelly was my hair stylist and she made me super comfortable. she would consult me on every cut she made. even though i live in helotes, i will drive to this great clips because i felt that as a customer i actually mattered."
"first time back to a great clips/chain haircut place since asking for a 1 on the sides and getting a buzz cut at a sportsclips. i was impressed by the check-in system which makes the waiting process slightly less tedious but really just saves you the trouble of writing your name on a piece of paper or remembering who came in before and after you - for that i give 2 stars for keeping up with the times. now for the cut. after about 30-45 min of waiting, which is very good for a sunday afternoon, i was shown to my seat by linda whom i trusted with her 40+ years of cutting hair. i had my hair styled in a classic side part, pretty straight forward and standard. just a trim is all i asked for, keeping the same style, straight tapered side burns with a hard part for emphasis/ease in future styling for myself. i knew this wasn't going to be prettying when she begins to cut my sideburns and the clipper randomly turns off and rips the hair out of the side of my head. this happened 2 more times until she switched clippers and plugged into a new socket. things afterward went fairly normal but the end product ended up with a terrible blend on the sides that puffs out and top that was equally trimmed. i now have an ice cream cone hair shape instead of my clean, slicked sides and top which took 4 months of cuts with my barber in houston to achieve. needless to say, i've lost all faith in these run of the mill salons that get people in and out. it's great for kids who don't need anything out of the ordinary but if you're a guy looking for a serious cut, take the time to find a barber who knows men's hair - it's well worth the ""trouble"". but hey, it's just hair, it'll grow back, right?"
"after leaving the bandera pointe location dissatisfied  today , my son and i proceeded to the huebner commons location here in san antonio where we where professionally greeted and i have to say dinorah who cut my sons hair did a wonderful job.  john used to cut my hair for many years until the drive got to be too far but i have to say he is one of the best. i highly recommend both of these stylist if your looking for a great haircut."
"erika (i think that was her name) gave me the best first-time haircut in my life. that is no joke. we had never met and i just walked in off the street. then i waited a long time to go back since i wanted to see if she could do it again, even if she kind of forgot me. when i went back, she sort of did not remember me, which was good for my plan. and guess what? another perfect cut. wow. here's the kicker: when she asked me how i wanted it cut, both times, i just said, ""make it look good"". and she sure did.i wish i could go to her for the rest of my life. but since i am not now in texas, here's hoping she will open her own line of salons and/or salon school. please, please, please erika, teach others to give those kinds of cuts! maybe great clips could get her to be national trainer or something. whenever i am back in town, i will be stopping by.(btw, if i have the wrong name, sorry, but i also recall her having a partial gold crown on a tooth. that would be another way to find her.)"
"i have to cut my hair once a month so i have been here a couple of times.  if you come early on a weekday there is no wait and you can get in and out in 10-15 minutes.  the staff is friendly and competent so if you need a trim in a hurry, this is the place to go."
"the pricing is not too bad, but the quality is really not there.i'm sure it's a hit or miss since they have multiple hair dressers, but i think quality control can definitely use some work."
i walked in and two stylist where sitting down they said it will be a few minutes. another customer walks in and goes straight to a chair a few minutes later another customer walks in and sits straight down. then i look back at the screen and i go from next to position 5 on the list while no one else walked in
wow this is the worst place ever! i walked in to get my veterans card and this so called manager lakent gave me the worst attitude about getting my card.  he said i had to get a service today and all this song and dance and told me to adjust my attitude. someone made this guy the manager. yea if you want attitude served on a platter this is the place and so much for the respect of other veterans.
"so it's haircut time an i decided to try out this location instead of my usual hair stylist but oh my yelper's i think i made a mistake but it's ok i'm on yelp helping my brother an sister yelper's don't come here unless you a different hair stylist then who i had her name was sarah an wow she definitely needs to look into a new line of work first of all talk to your customers i mean talk about awkward silence we could of talked about the weather or my day or even yours we could of talked about your two time hair two tone hair of blonde an black i would have been happy to talk about your upper center lip piercing anything but silence not good in my opinion but if you like that type of stylish omg you'll love her not me then 2nd thing (shaking my head) in dis belief of the mistake you made following not talking to me, yelper's can you believe it my fade was uneven when i told her she even tried to fix it but was unsuccessful made it even more uneven i was completely flabbergasted by this that after attempting to fix her own mistake i gave up an said forget it what's done is done so finally when i thought it can get worse it does wow i said finger length top no not sarah she does what she wants an then her come the clippers not sure where she was gonna cut with the clippers by the time she did the top of my head it was to late why sarah well if she thought it was gonna look good she was wrong not only did she leave my hair uneven it now it's also extremely short no need to style well i will say a few good things about this place so i don't seem like i'm bashing it too harsh when i walked in i was immediately greeted felt very welcome to arrive thank you an the restroom is excellent clean  good luck yelper's if you choose to cut your hair here if i knew this was gonna happen i would have gone to a kindergarten school to cut my hair by kindergarteners i'm sure it would of came out better then this"
"these people really don't care about their job. they don't care about the customer. when i went, i had to sign up using the online wait list. the waitlist told me that i had a specific time to show up. i showed up 10 minutes before that time, but i was never registered in their system or i was skipped. the clerk told me that i needed to register online again or register in person and wait for another hour. this has happened twice now and i felt that i was just another number in their system. definitely do not want to return here ever again. they don't care about keeping their customers and so i will not come here again."
horrible experience here came in for a trim and came out with a high and tight.... i will not be getting a hair cut at great clips here again
"went in for a quick trim and left totally butchered. throughout the cut my stylist was distracted and left my seat about 15 times to handle the front desk and reprimand employees in front of everyone. should have gone with my gut and got out of there asap, but i had to take my glasses off for the cut and i couldn't see what was happening.  terrible move. i asked for a trim and to blend it a little longer up top, and came away looking like a damn adolf toadstool from mario brothers and had to pay $15 bucks to walk out in my hat. terrible. if you have hair and want anything other than a buzz, do not go here."
"the wait here is horrendous and even if you check in online they don't see you on time, so what's the point. the only they are busy is because there no other salons or places to get your haircut nearby. i only use this place when i have to and i usually regret it. funny thing is i never have these issues at other great clips locations."
i've never had to wait too long at all here when i check in online. i've always gotten good haircuts and never had any complaints. i had rose and she did a wonderful job and was very friendly the whole time.
don't get a haircut from jennifer she cuts your hair really rough & she seems a little bitchy i just can't believe how bad she cut my hair and my hair was a simple men's haircut and she was complaining how long its taking to cut my hair. um i'm a guy!!! my hair is not that long!!! it's only been 2 weeks since i got my hair cut from another stylist at this location..so i don't understand why your complaining.. you need to find a different job!! and i'll stick to the other stylist thanks!!
hasn't given me any issues and they know how to cut my hair because of the frequent customer app they run. only reason it is not 5 stars is their conversation to each other was unprofessional and they didn't tell me about the free rinse after until i asked about it.  i mean every guy hates that itchy feeling around the neck after a haircut.
"i recently moved from out of town and am very loyal my hairstylist but it was time for me to find a new place.   this particular location is close to my home and the first time a man there cut it all wrong however i went back and they fixed it up.  now i went again and the girl that i got this time cut my ear and didnt tell me. i felt a knick but that was that, i was disappointed slightly with the cut but when i got home i saw my ear was bleeding. i became furious and went back in.  they just cant seem to get it right.  a lady with salt and pepper hair is always the one who takes my complaint.she seems to be the only one that knows what she is doing , everyone else not so much"
"this is about one particular hairstylist name nancy. usually i don't have a problem with great clips, but this time, it was awful. she was brushing through my hair and claimed that she sees head lice. um, what? she then brush flake off to show me... it was dandruff. but she kept insisting it was lice. so i left and went to my doctor's office. it was dandruff. how can someone be so stupid to accuse a customer of having head lice when you can't tell the difference between dandruff and lice? never coming back there again."
"unfortunately i forgot the woman's name who cut my hair, but she was very nice to me and gave me a great cut. i was very surprised. i have gone to a few different great clips and it's usually a terrible cut, but she was great. i just moved to san antonio and it was a nice to talk to a friendly person."
"might as well have done it myself...earlier today i took my son for a haircut. after waiting for over half an hour as others ""previously signed in"" took their seats, my son finally was served.my son is a special needs person, and is very uncomfortable with confrontations or advocating actively for himself. at the end of the alleged ""haircut"" session, he was left with a ""wicked comb-over"" for the front of his scalp, and a poorly shaped occiput and collar line. to add insult to injury, the employee (whom i refuse to call a ""stylist"") accepted a gratuity exceeding 50% of the bill, without missing a beat.i strongly encourage prospective customers to look elsewhere, or just cut your own hair. you'll be better satisfied, and you'll save some money."
"like i said in my last post, i went back and i am happy and satisfied even more. kim did amazing job and now i know for sure i will be back."
i understan this places they do a lot of employee rotation. but personally i got a very good service from diana.
"thanks,  heidi..... for giving my son a great haircut for the last few days of school. the cut looks awesome for our vaca.   it was a quick, painless, visit as always!!  there were about 10 people waiting to get haircuts and everyone got taken care of quickly.   that is what we hope for when it is beautiful outside."
"the service was lackluster, but i wouldn't expect much better from a quickie haircut place. they could have been a bit friendlier. i didn't get my haircut, but my friend did and the end result was good. nobody was there at noon on a saturday, so if you're in a hurry, i'd recommend it, just don't expect the friendliest of people."
steven is the worst stylist in this establishment. he smells and coughs everywhere. he has cut my hair the last 2 times i've been in and totally screwed up. today he cut one side of my bangs but not the other. don't worry i fixed it myself.
"cindy is the best!!! def give her a try! they take appointments and walk ins at this place too. not to mention it was pretty cheap too. i am very picky on who i let do my hair but i needed a trim really bad so i gave this place a try. i can say that i have found a home for my hair. they do men's and women's and cindy is very nice, funny, and talented. you won't be sorry!"
"horrible i just got my haircut there today and it looks horrible worst haircut i've ever gotten. you definitely get what you pay for,  the staff is very unprofessional and you can tell that some of them don't know what they are doing. now i have to go somewhere else and pay more to get it fixed should've just paid extra to go somewhere better in the first place"
i like getting my hair cut but online check in system is bull crap. when i walk in 2 onlines ahead of me. only my son and i are here i got hair cut my son had to wait for these 2 guys because they showed up. they keep the online check ins for an hour. total crap i always try not to go here anymore because of this
"i don't even know where to start, our experience was bad all around.  i went in with my husband and two sons and all three of them got a bad haircut.  the worst was my six and half year old.  jackie, the woman cutting his hair, actually hurt him cutting his hair and made him cry.  i thought at first he was just being whiney but then i saw that he was actually bleeding!!!  seriously??  he was being still there was no reason for him to be bleeding.  amanda b cut my husband's and two year old's hair did an ok job but she was incredibly unfriendly.  actually there didn't seem to be a friendly person in the place.  as soon as we walked out i promised my older son that we would never go back there.  do yourself a favor and go across the street to sports clips."
"i would take away stars if i could.  worst experience for me and my family.  two days ago i took my 5 yr old daughter & 4 yr old son there because i thought it would be more affordable than the kid places and just as good - i was so wrong!my daughter has loose curls and i have straight hair so i don't always know who things are going to turn out with her hair.  i explained to the woman cutting that my daughter wanted short hair - like at the end of rapunzel - and showed her what i meant.  i also let her know that i was worried since i knew the curls would spring up and didn't know what it would turn out like.  i asked her if i should keep it longer or if the cut works on short hair?  she couldn't give me any idea what so ever.  she said, ""so you want it to hit her neck?""  i said, ""no, not if it won't look right.  what will curly hair  look like?""  she just looked at my daughter's hair and didn't say anything but sort of shrug her shoulders.  since the woman had long hair with some curl in it, i told her to just trim and keep it long with layers.  usually they can do someone else's hair like their own. the layers are horrible!  it's like she tried to give it a feathery look that just doesn't work with curls.  instead of the beautiful individual curls we started with, she now has one continuous wave at the back of her head.my son's hair didn't turn out any better from the other woman who cut his hair.  my husband stood by and explained to keep it a little long on top.  she took the order and spent the rest of the time talking to another associate.  she cut it short like a military cut (which i did not want).  and my poor son has crooked cuts all over his head!i gave it two days to see if their hair would settle to something nicer, since fresh cuts sometimes (but rarely) be deceiving, but i can still see the jagged cuts in my son's hair and my daughter's hair is even less cooperative even though i'm using products that usually tame it.  the only reason i haven't gone in to complain is because i would have to bring the kids to show what's wrong and i don't want the kids to hear me say something negative about their cuts.sorry i don't have staff names, but it was not the cindy mentioned in the other review."
thanks shannon! love my hair ! u did an excellent job! hadnt had my hair cut in a long time and u nailed it!!!much thanks!!!lucy
"went here for my son's haircut on a referral from family in the area. wait was 45+ minutes when we signed in but that was my fault for waiting to come in until the evening. the place is clean, including the restroom. decent amount of products in stock. ""imma"" cut my son's hair and did a pretty good job. she made sure to put his haircut description into their system so the next time we go in, the stylist will already know what he prefers. likes: i liked that as you sign in a monitor faces the customers so you can see how many people are ahead of you. i liked that as people came in they are greeted. i liked that customers are apparently able to sign in online/on an app. dislikes: none as of yet."
"i will not come back to this location.  stylist inmaculada was incredibly rude and abrasive, undermining my parenting, telling them to sit in the barber chairs next to me when i told them to stay in the waiting area at the front of the store, offered them candy after i told them they could not have candy, and then when i asked her to stop and let my do my job as a parent, she tried to argue with me."
"awesome, awesome experience this morning! i figured it would be a bit of a wait, considering it's a saturday morning and the change of seasons. there was a stylist at every chair, and a customer in every chair- but they are so efficient that i didn't wait more than 5 minutes. once in the chair, i felt very comfortable, my stylist asked me what i wanted and told me exactly how she was going to do that for me. i cut off about four inches from the back and evened it all out for a really cute bob. i am very very happy with my result, and i will be back. :-)"
"it might not look like much on the outside, but it's pretty awesome. the inside is nice and the people are even nicer. i went to sarah and she was really nice and did a great job. i will definitely be returning here to see her again."
i enjoy going to this location. they have been cutting me and my kids hair for about 4 years now. there is a lot of business going through the doors and i don't mind the wait for a good haircut. they staff it appropriately for the traffic.
"i love this laid back place. i'm not high maintenance so it's perfect. they don't make fun of my box dye job; just give me the exact cut i want and i'm always pleased. very nice and friendly stylists, too."
staff is always friendly and they always know how you ordered your last haircut
"i had been going there for a while and had the hair cut i liked in the system,so i went in and they cut my almost bald when i had a medium style haircut in the book"
myself and my boys never go anywhere else.  the girls are always friendly and consistent.  love em!
"my family and i have been coming to this place for the past 7 years. they are extremely consistent and always have a great attitude. they always welcome you with a resounding, ""welcome to greatclips!!"". we plan on using their services for many years to come."
"you like to gamble? are you into fits of anxiety? this place is like putting your quarter into the gumball machine and hoping for the red piece... sometimes you get it... some times you get the yellow one. isn't it obvious? every time you come here, there's different stylists working? forest gump could have written this review... ""you never know what you're gonna get...""  i only go here when i'm feeling suicidal... anyone up for a little ""haircut roulette?"""
"no wait great service very fast and efficient, did my brothers hair cut just how he wanted"
"the place started to go downhill. rude manager,  no longer offering discounts to veterans at this location and my last two haircuts ended with cuts in my head. alon location nearby is way better"
wow i cant believe the damage this place did to my pet boyfriend. he dropped in at about 10 am-11am for a haircut to get ready for new years celebrations and he walked out beat up and looking like he has some kind of rash or allergic reaction. the lady that cut his hair used dull clippers. it felt like he was being shaved with a disposable razor. it even broke skin in some places. please see pictures and avoid! 1 star for not messing up the actual haircut.
i had a great experience here at this great clips. the two ladies were really nice and the blonde lady did a good job on what i wanted. she looked at the picture twice to make sure and it came out beautifully. unlike the last time i went somewhere else i showed the same picture and she didn't do what i wanted.
"came here with my boyfriend to get his hair cut. he wanted a basic clean up and fade. nothing too drastic or difficult. the stylist on the (i cannot remember her name but she is above average height) was rude from the get go. when she finished his hair he had long pieces sticking up on the top on both sides, uneven shave on the bottom and an almost bald spot in the back. we went back the next day to ask if she could could fix it (maybe she didn't see it because of the lighting or something) and she said no that's just how his hair is because of a ""cowlick"" and ignored the other two problems. that's a common excuse from stylists who haven't had enough training or just haven't perfected how to do a fade. i asked as politely as i could, which is hard because situations like these are already super awkward, if someone else could try to fix it and she was obviously so offended. i can't pay for a service when i know that he doesn't have a cowlick and he's had his hair cut the same style perfectly at several other places. a polite gentleman fixed it for us while the other stylist made faces, shook her head, and made remarks under her breath. i thanked both of them again before we left but she wouldn't look up from her other client and acknowledge me... we tipped both of them. i also want to add that we have run into her outside of the salon and she made the ugliest faces and once again made remarks under her breath like we are in highschool. really? we tried to be as polite as possible. it's not my fault you didn't know how to do it and you should learn how to handle critism if you're going to do a job like that. it felt like she's expecting judgement and rudeness from everyone so she beats you to it and treats you poorly. i don't recommend this location only because of her. everyone else there is polite and professional."
"we'll never go back!!!  i ask for something to be done different, next thing i know my 4 year old says ouch.  she was being too rough if you don't like your job quit, don't take it out on my kid wow!!!"
"place is just ok, they don't actually work as per customer satisfaction, but anyways it was not really bad."
"we used to come for a decent haircut at a decent price. we now come here more for the convenience of the location. the stylist today kept asking for assistance from the other employees. it felt almost as if i was getting a hair cut at a beauty college rather than at a place of business with licensed stylists. i wasn't happy with the outcome, but i didn't want this person to cut any more cause i was worried that it'd come out worse. this isn't the first time. also, a number of the stylist smelled like cigarettes. not a good smell when your hand is in my face cutting my hair. sorry to say, i feel that the quality of work done at this location has really gone done."
"worst haircut of my life. ""stylist"" was harsh, music was loud and inappropriate for family setting. no receipt given. felt unwelcome, will never go back"
"very few good stylists at this location. i have been going for years and cannot recommend any by name except for xtina so don't have high hopes for quality work here. good haircut happens about 1/5 visits and i have left before because of stylists that i know don't communicate well and with less than a professional attitude. lottery every time but the damn location is so confident...an checking in ""online"" or with the app is not much better....you still sit in like with the others that check in and sometimes even walk ins depending on your time."
"i think the experience at any salon depends on the hair stylist. if you found someone that did a good job, keep using that person. just few tips:1) come here around 8 pm on week day, there is usually no line. i think out of the 10 times i'm here, the longest wait was 10 mins. 8/10 times, i check in and i go straight to the chair. 2) weekends or long weekends, this place is packed."
"went to get my hair curled and had a picture to show the stylist what i wanted. absolutely horrible job, put too much product in and made my hair greasy and she comb the curls out which made it frizz. i had to leave and was very disappointed in the job, i shouldn't have paid. i was on a time limit, which the stylist knew. i left to go wash my hair and style it myself, which came out better than the job i received. never going back again. i'll stick to the blow dry bars, better pricing and they do a way better job!"
"they do a good job here, i am pretty simple with my hair, just a shampoo and cut at the ends. i enjoy the shampoo, they do a little massage to your scalp that feels nice. sometimes they try to push their products for sale, which i don't like."
"i don't like hair cutters who nick the skin around the scalp when my kids get a haircut. probably will not be returning for a long, long, long time."
"i agree with most of the other reviewers, this place is a lottery. $13 for adult cut, not too bad a price, and they run specials every once in awhile. i've been to this location twice: the first time there was a young girl that went by the name sami (maybe samy) and she was amazing. i wanted a drastic change to my long curly hair, and she worked meticulously on it; gave me layers and cut it shorter than i've ever had it. i absolutely loved it. i came back about 4.5 months later to get it trimmed, and i was told she no longer works there, so i just let another stylist cut it. she did fine, but she was against cutting as short as sami did. so i know i'll have to go back soon to maintain the length. i really wish i could find out if this hairstylist still works in san antonio!!!in conclusion, if you just want a quick, simple hair cut, this is the place to go.also, both times i went on a week day, once at 12, and the other at 1, and there wasn't a line."
"i got to say impressed with work and customer service from jelenna, she cut my daughters hair and did an amazing job!!!"
"so, many great businesses i've left reviews for have thanked me or offered to fix their error.  not one attempt from this franchise. i'm 3 weeks since my bad cut and hair is growing towards my ears and i'm starting to think about getting another cut..... but my bangs are still to short and pissing me off, so i'll wait a bit longer to get my next cut."
"i've gone there now 4-5 times, close to home, different stylist every time, and results are the same love it"
"i went here for years with my son and stopped going because i started to get a subpar haircut/experience. i'll admit, jennifer is awesome, but always busy, because she does a great job in which others always request her. but last week i needed to get a haircut on a saturday and decided to give them another shot since it was the weekend and i was desperate.  once again another subpar haircut and  subpar experience. i hate feeling like cattle and being rushed out in world record time. i'll be going elsewhere instead."
great service and availability of highly qualified hair cutting stylists.i appreciate the attitude and quality.online booking app/web is a great option
i usually go to get my hair trimmed and never had any issues so i took my husband to get his hair cut since we were both running errands and we can get what we need done together. he was hesitant he wasn't confident that the stylist would know how to cut i said i've never had an issue and there was lots of men getting their hair cut today. i was helped first and finished first. then waiting for him i saw his face and his horrible haircut. i was in shock how the hair stylist thought this was a good job to still want to charge him and we were so embarrassed to even dispute it while everyone was in close range. so i felt so horrible i paid... i even tipped again i was too embarrassed to go off on this stylist. i would never come back or have him come back. we had to go to another place where an experienced barber can fix his hair he only charges 14. if you want a jagged choppy haircut this is the place for you.
"if you go here, do not let karina cut your hair. she sucks!!! my husband & kids come here a lot & most of the time, the cut comes out okay because we give them simple instruction: 0.5 around & 4 at the top. i don't know how you can mess that up, but karina did! my son is taking his graduation pic this week looking almost bald. we'll still go back here, but we'll never have karina cut my boys' hair again!"
great place to get a hair cut. jennifer does great work and listens to the styles you'd like. this is the one out in eastlake.
i came to great clips and they have amazing service i was really happy with my hair cut it was so beautiful. great clips made my day!!
"great place for haircut for me easy to use the app and get a quick appointmentalways fast and easy for mei see some of the women had reviews and issue with their hair, so not sure about that.i would recommend for men as it is in the shopping area and i can go to target and lowes will i amin the shopping area."
"very uneven hair cut for myself and my wife. will not be going back again, i wasn't happy the first time either. cheap hair cut but you get what you pay for."
last minute find before heading back to guam. was welcomed by sally. wonderful personality and made the hair cut entertaining. thanks. hair cut on point.
"if you're looking for a haircut without an appointment,... seek another place. this establishment only focuses on online appointments. wanted to try this place since it has a lot of good reviews but,... completely had a horrible experience. waited for more than an hour to get a haircut!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wtf! to make matter worst,.. they kept a screen with names who's next but does not follow it. was second and yet was passed (girl picked the 5th person without online appointment) fuck this place."
"i take my 7 year old son here for his haircuts, definitely recommend jennifer! she's super nice, always double checks with me before and during the cut. his hair looks perfect every time."
"been going to this place for about 3 years. sally has been cutting my hair majority of the time when i came in. i get along with her, she's nice, and caring."
"this place has such a great vibe. the women who cut the hair are extremely nice, except for one, but other than that, great service! i recommend sally! she's probably the best out of them all, so ask for her!"
katrina did an amazing job on my sons first haircut. she was patient yet quick. my 1 year old was not scared at all! thanks for the great cut!!!
"definitely a decent place to get a haircut if you are in the eastlake area.  i have come several times and have had good experiences so far.  the prices are reasonable, the stylists are helpful and the place is clean.  i highly recommend checking in online during peak hours otherwise you will be waiting for awhile."
"the worst haircut in 12 yrs. i asked the stylist to take 1 1/2"" off my girls long hair w/a tiny bit of layers. clean up what she has. she showed me her definition of 1 1/2"". i agreed. during the cut, 3 stylists went to my daughter & measured her hair where cuts were made. one or two made addt'l cuts. in between, the original stylist made more cuts. after the final ""helper"" left, i asked her to tell me honestly how much had been cut, while more is being cut from my daughters hair. she said, ""1 1/2 inches."" i said my anxiety was due to the 3 ""helpers"". she says, ""oh we just checked her cuts. don't worry. it's a great cut."" i will not be back. (trying to post a pic.)"
"i've always had good experiences here. employee turnover means you can have a regular hair stylist but within 6 months they are gone. but everyone here is good...they keep notes in the computer of your hair styling needs. clipper length, style on top, etc... parking in this lot can be kind of crazy especially at busy periods."
"i've been going to great clips for quite awhile. i started off at the balboa store, and have been getting my cut from frankie. my wife and mother also see frankie. all three of us are extremely happy with the effort that she always gives. frankie pays attention to detail and remembers how all three of us like our cuts. she always gives suggestions, and we've never once had a complaint since frankie became our stylist. so, if you are looking for not only a great haircut, but a stylist that will make your time in her chair, fun, then go to the pacific beach location. if you have a cell phone (seriously, who doesn't?) get the great clips app, and check in online, and have a much shorter wait."
"i am also part of frankie's ""fans"". frankie relocated here to this location. this great clips location does not offer the discount card for multiple haircuts. that is why i am giving a 4 for the salon but believe me a 5 for frankie."
first time coming here.  i brought my five year old son.  i love the location as it's close to home and conveniently located near a frozen yogurt place for a nice treat afterwards.michelle was his hair stylist and was so good with him.  right before us she cut the hair of an 18 month old baby.i showed a pinterest picture of the hairstyle i was going for and she did amazing.  i have had already a few moms ask where did he get his hair cut.so i'm here to say michelle is awesome with kids and an expert stylist.cost: $15tip: $5cheaper than little locks in la jolla.they could make it a bit more kid friendly.  we appreciated the lego blocks and lollipop  very much!!
i hate to complain about a $17 haircut but as soon as we got to the car and i saw the uneven lines and long patches everywhere i went straight to cvs to purchase clippers. i couldn't let him go to school in the morning like this. i wish i had taken more pics but it was pretty bad
told me i had to check in online. this place is only good if you don't mind average. they had an attitude and it seemed i was a bother as opposed to being a customer.
i came in today and there were two people getting a haircut. one person was in front of me and i was told a 10-15 min wait. 50 mins later one of the 2 hair stylists leaves and there is still one person in front of me. waisted my hour off for lunch to end up not getting a haircut. never coming back.
"deebeh is the best!  this great clips has deebeh! the other stylists are probably good, and they cut hair fast with a great value.  i have been going to this great clips for almost four years because i had a not-so-stellar haircut (by someone who has now left this location) and deebeh fixed it no questions asked, with a polite apology and a smile!since then, deebeh has cut my hair approximately 50 times, and each time she is pleasent, friendly, professional, and does a fantastic job.  she is great!so, while i keep going to this great clips because they are cheap, and get the job done, i definitely recommend deebeh because she is awesome, and does great work!"
shout out to veronica for giving me the best haircut of my life. i'm hard to please when it comes to getting my haircut but veronica nailed it the first time she ever cut it. i explained how i was unhappy with past haircuts and she asked me a bunch of questions and found out what i was looking for. she is a true professional and i'll definitely be coming back
"been coming here for 4+ years. never really have to wait, all the employees are friendly but don't talk your ear off. shelly is great!"
"irma is the best hairdresser on the planet. no question. she is incredibly professional, detailed oriented and one of the nicest people to deal with. i refuse to let anyone else cut my hair!"
"irma did an amazing job. i'm new to la jolla and was in search for a new stylist after 10 years. she's competent, caring, and detailed oriented. highly recommend irma!"
i have been going here for a year now. checked in online which said to arrive by 5pm i arrived 15 miutes before and was rudely told they are closed. i asked abiut my online checkin and she rudely stated again that they had a busy day and she was not cutting anymore hair today. she was right she will not be cutting my hair. i feel sorry for victoria who actually does a great job. that is the reason for the 2 stars. victoria 5 stars.
"they messed up my cowlick. worst haircut i've gotten in years, and i've been getting it cut the same way for ~5 years. won't be coming back"
unfortunately this location made their own policy for veterans day and chose not to honor the promotion as great clips is know for.  i reported them to great clips hq and they said the franchise owner is in the wrong!  chose another location for veterans!
"i took my daughter in for a bang trim, she was so obedient and sweet - did everything the woman said. i stayed on the sidelines and didn't interfere and was very unaware of the horrible haircut that was being done. her bangs were crooked and choppy and she absolutely hacked the sides of her hair leaving her with a ""mullet"" style haircut: super short bangs in the front, choppy hair at her ears and long straggly hair in the back. when she presented my daughter to me and said they were done i couldn't help but laughing out loud. instead of apologizing and offering to fix the things i was pointing out to her she justified her work!! absolutely unprofessional. she then charged me for my visit. i took her to the great clips in the utc and the women there fixed her hair cut for me. they were polite and apologetic and ""did their best"" to fix the hack job done in pacific beach. we will never go back to irma at the pb great clips."
"do not work for this franchisee. im currently going through the necessary legal hoops to ensure that they are exposed for unprofessionalism at levels that have exceeded civil and legal standards that i promise will not benefit u. i was treated (in my opinion) discrimination do to my living situation ,gender and sexual orientation. i was held accountable by policies that were never given to me. training that is only given if u ask other employees that can access all your pr info do to shared passwords. pay is allocated by clocking in and out but if your time clock is not to the owners liking she will gladly alter or change it. this will not be shared with you. if you dont keep record of your time you may find your hours are not accurate. this is my personal experiences that i hope will help yours not be as unfortunate. proceed with caution. supercuts is much better and will allow u to grow ur skills."
"terrible, terrible customer service!  used the online check in for my son (19 months).   we did some errands because the wait was 63 minutes.  i still waited an additional 30 minutes beyond this.  as it was about his turn,  we had to do a diaper change.   i told them i would be back in 2 min, which i was.   they proceeded to let someone else go in front of us.  i've been going there for almost a year but this will absolutely be our last time.   the hairdresser was super rude and inconsiderate towards me and my child."
"my experience at great clips was, as the name suggests, great. i checked in online, arrived at the shop and was seated immediately, the haircut was fast but with great attention to detail and my instructions (i brought pictures to show what i was looking for) and i left with my hair cut just the way i wanted it. and all this friendly and great service at a very affordable price (even for a student) !(the only downside was that i could not blow dry my hair over a round brush, which would have been charged extra.)"
i've been coming here for awhile now and never have to wait very long in order to get my haircut without an appointment. yesterday i went and had sam cut my hair for the first time. he was really nice and explained hair products to me and had a friendly discussion as well. he also took extra steps for a smoother blend and reccomended the best ways to get discounts on the product they offer.  i will be back soon!
first time i came here a year ago they butchered me. i am reasonable and i know things happen and at the time i just let it go. so a year has passed and i figured i would give it a second chance.  this time i left with a bloody nick behind me ear and a botched fade. when the girl cutting my hair started to cry about what she did she mentioned how hard things are for her and that they only pay her $9 an hour. i felt bad for her and left after tipping her $5 to cut me.  at $9 an hour i guess they dont care about having qualified styists. live and learn i guess. probably better and safer to find another place to go for a haircut..
"i have come here every week for the past year and and i have never been disappointed.  if you need a good fade and netflix recommendations, ask for sabrina."
"i walked in and got very nicely greeted. i waited  a short time, the only woman that was not smiling and looked like she just really hated her job lucia asked if i was ready. i was nervous cause of her attitude. i tried to lighten her mood to see if see would smile but it didn't work. she goes on to ask what i would like done? so i tell her i want a good amount cut in the back and layered in the front. she said she can't because i would have gaps and does not feel comfortable layering  my hair. instead of asking someone else to cut my hair she just asked someone elses opinion. that lady said whatever u feel comfortable with to lucia instead of asking to take over or if i am comfortable! this haircut wasn't brain surgery it was a simple basic woman's haircut. for them not to try to make me happy was unreal! i'm not sure how she even had a license to cut hair. this place i would not recommend ever! lucia was not friendly and the lack of haircut skills was unreal"
"i've been going to great clips about the last six months. as we are traveling the country in our rv it's nice that they can keep records of your visit with notes on how you like you hair to be cut. well, at least that's the way it's supposed to work......the fellow that was trying to check customers in shouldn't be doing this job. he's nice enough but his english language skills aren't the greatest. nor ar his typing skills. he never did get my info straight. one of the stylists tried but even she was unsuccessful. i'm not sure why. i've checked in from northern washington to portland, oregon to yuma city, california and never had an issue. strange. but, back to my hair stylist. i'd read a review where a mother complained about this gal being rough when she cut her daughter's hair. rough is an understatement! i've never had my hair jerked like that before. now for me it didn't hurt bad, but i can well imagine what that felt like to a five year old. i know it was the same gal although i don't recall her name. it was something like vima maybe. she sounded eastern european to me, not that that matters. but she needs to have a few lessons and tug a little easier on folks hair. i'm glad we're traveling. next time we're in the area i'll go to another great clips. just not this location."
worse place ever! she messed up my hair bad. waste of 20 dollars seriously. i was ready to cut most of my long hair off but she didnt listen! she did what she wanted with my hair. after i got home i looked at my hair and it looks like a 5 year old grabbed scissors and just chopped my hair. i think her name was sabrina. dont let sabrina get close to your hair!
"i recently visited this salon,  my experience was excellent. thank you girls for the great service and haircut for all my boys."
"i went in last week and had the worst salon experience i have ever had. deziree yanked and pulled on my head while dry brushing my curly hair, and by the end of the first ten minutes i was almost in tears. i should have left at that point but i really wanted to have not wasted the ten minutes she just spent torturing me. she soaked the top half of my shirt during the wash, and never asked a single question about what i wanted. i finally offered that i'd like to take dead ends off and that i'd like layers. she added no layers in my hair, but she kept asking me ""doesn't that feel better?"" not once did she ask if i liked it. i basically have a blunt cut and with curly hair that means i have triangle head. i left the salon a frizzy mess because she didn't use a single styling product, and she thought that scrubbing my head dry with a terrycloth towel was a good idea. my scalp was so sensitive from her tugging on my hair i couldn't put it up for three days. she made me feel horrible about my hair, that it was a burden that had to be dealt with. i left feeling humiliated and degraded, and once in the car i had a complete breakdown. as someone who struggles with anxiety and depression i have a hard time going to do things like getting my hair cut. i just wanted to go in and get a fresh cut, maybe a new style, just to get a little morale boost. instead i got deziree. i tried to email corporate about the incident before coming here and they sent me and email that basically said ""sorry, it's a franchise! but we'll pass on your comments to the owner and they'll call you soon."" that was last week. no one ever called. the carelessness goes all the way to the top, apparently. i've never had an issue with gc before this, but i will literally never step foot into another gc again."
"i brought my daughter into this location as a walk-in, and they tended to her immediately. she had a delightful experience, and wanted to come back into today. sabrina was amazing, and very customer service oriented, while personable with my 5year old daughter. i will be bringing her back to this location here soon. thank you, sabrina!"
adorable haircut by a great stylist who really listens. thank you for my daughters new summer time look!
"such nice people who do nice work. the stylists are speedy, nice, easy going. i've been getting my hair cut here for years and my 5 year old son has a nice time too."
this is my second time coming to this location and i loved it both times! the shampoo used for my hair smells amazing and i was shown deals on other hair products. this is probably where i'm coming to get my hair cut from now on.
"deziree was absolutely horrid. my niece left in tears because the lady was very rough, abusive and mean. basically threatened her that she would have to shave her head because her hair is ""so damaged"". do not let her touch your head or your child's head. she never once asked if we wanted to pay more to have her wash the hair to make it easier. just belittled and berated and complained that the hair was so bad. and didn't even attempt to do the hair cut she was asked to do. absolutely horrible."
terrible. i would give them 0 stars but forced to give them 1. can't post this review unless i make it longer. it this long enough?
"my husband's hair is so hard to cut correctly! deziree not only did a fantastic job, she was very fast. you can get a ""frequent flyer"" card for a free haircut. you can also check in on your phone so you don't have to wait. very friendly and professional people work here and it's very clean."
"so... this is long overdue and i am officially  boycotting this shop now. i shouldve just stuck to my go to but this haircut was pretty last minute so i chose this train wreck of a business. the 1st time i went there in quite a bit of time i was met by a girl who was very nice. i have to admit. but...she cut my hair and literally bragged the entire time she was cutting it about how good she was. now..... being confident it one thing. be completely cocky is another. she may have felt she did an ""amazing"" job but i had to come home and touch it up myself. not only that getting a haircut is a pretty personal and an up close event. not cool to be cutting someones hair and wreaking of cigarettes the whole time. so that was my 1st visit in awhile. today was my second visit in quite awhile and will be my last. deziree cut my hair. for the most part she did ok. i had to again, come home and touch it up as there were chunks of hair uncut and much longer than the area surrounding it. a previous yelper put she was quite rough. yeah, for some reason the clippers kept catching my damn skull and driving the guard into my head. not a comfortable feeling. you would think after the 2nd time you would switch up what youre doing. oh no. happened like 8-9 more times. there are many places in santee to get a haircut, this is not one of them. i choose not to indulge who i go to normally and shouldve just gone to because this is not review to promote them. this is a review to tell you all... great clips sucks and will not get my business anymore. sorry..  but today was the last straw."
"horrible experience!  the stylist, vian, trimmed my daughter's hair and was extremely rough and just pulled and pulled on my daughter's hair like she was some kind of animal.  we will never be back!  no wonder it was so empty in there (i guess that should have been my first clue)."
"the ladies here are super nice and the candy cup at the register is always well stocked. i love that you can check the wait times online and check in online so you can be seen first when you arrive. the days and times your favorite stylist are in always change so if you can, call ahead to check if they're in but you're in good hands no matter who you go to."
terrible! i took my son in to get a haircut because i had a coupon and i figured his cut is so easy you can't mess it up. well i was wrong... these ladies seriously have no idea what they are doing. i asked for a 1 faded up and blended and just to trim up the top. there is no fade and she did not blend it at all. it seriously looks like she put a bowl on his head and cut around it. i should have just went where i usually take him because now i have to take him and get it fixed anyways..
"typically have a great experience at this location, but not this time. stylist in chair to the right in front (opposite receptionist booth) was beyond rude. my teenage daughter gave very clear directions as to how she wanted her hair cut. stylist said to her, ""i'm not going that short, i'm leaving it at x length."" she might have made three snips with the scissors and declared her done. we were in and out in under ten minutes.  i paid 20 dollars for my daughter to walk out looking exactly as she did when we walked in. due to the attitude, i said nothing, paid for the careless service, and decided the best i could do is to warn others. we won't be using this particular location in the future based solely off this one stylist poor attitude and lack of service. it's a shame because up until now, i've always left pleased. save yourself the drive and cut the hair yourself. you certainly couldn't do worse. update: i knew better, but i had really hoped that last time was just a fluke. it wasn't. i took my son in for a very simple haircut including pics of exactly what he wanted. he is 12 and more than old enough to explain what he wants. he showed her the pictures, explained to her how much he wanted cut, and she called me back four times because ""she wasn't clear"". i showed her the pictures again. explained this was exactly what he wanted. pictures covered all sides of the cut. it was a simple, short on the sides and a bit longer on the top. we aren't talking about some radical cut. in the end, it was close to what he had asked for, but even after he emphatically told her she had cut enough off the length, she continued to take some off. i understand needing to even put things, but this wasn't the case.  he doesn't hate it, but it is much shorter than he requested and once again that falls squarely on the stylist not listening to the client."
walked in 30mins before close and they still took me in. amazing service. her name was sonia that cut my hair. she was very nice. i would come here again to get a trim :)
"this place has always been crap. i stopped going 4 years ago but had a coupon and took my self and son in for cuts. the hairstylist who cut my hair was so nice and i felt i could trust her. yeah, conversation was diversion tactic so you don't pay attention to a crappy haircut! so uneven and missed most of the split ends on the ""trim"" i asked for. my sons hairstylist asked about a million times how it should be cut. i gave her straight forward and simple instructions; short on sides and a little longer on top so he could spike it up if he wanted to. i told her we don't know the numbers, please stop asking. she said, ""well, the computer says...."" and i reminded her at least a dozen times that we hadn't been in since my son was 4 and that styles have changed - so we do not go by what the computer notes say. she chopped his hair so uneven, we have to just let it grow out or shave it off. i have never gotten good haircuts here. serves me right for being cheap and trying it on a coupon. the prices are terribly high for the crap you get."
"this place always has no wait, is sanitary, has a friendly staff, and they take their time with the hair cuts to make sure it is done right! they do an overall fantastic job! i've been coming to this location for 6 months and i will continue to do so! they also have discounts for military and returning customers! highly recommended!"
"they are offering 3$ off if you write a yelp review... trying to up their rating i guess.place was clean, no wait, no issues with the online check in. the staff was friendly as well.haircut was crap as always. uneven cut, sideburns were way high and uneven as well. again, spent twice as much to get a worse haircut. there are so many other places in la mesa that do better for less.... only reason i went today was because my normal place was closed today.... poor planning on my part so i'll walk around with my badge of shame until it grows back."
"terrible period!!! watch out for tomasa - tommy, she'll tear up your looks. i would rate this place a big fat 0!"
"very frustrating to call ahead to this place to see if the person who cuts your hair is going to be there and when you show up they're not, again. same person was supposed to order product for me and text us when it came in, haven't heard from her."
"this place is pretty hit and miss. i had a new girl cut my hair today. it was a pretty bad experience , one of the worst hair cuts i have ever had. i also asked her to wash my hair after the hair cut to get off all the hair she was just cutting and dropping on top of my head.  she squirted my head with cold water for about 10 seconds and said ok all your set! sending me out the door with tons of hair all over my head and face."
just got my hair done here. was really satisfied with the outcome. very good and fast service. i asked for a fade and my fade ended up nicer than i thought. i definently reccomend this place. very good service and price!
"i came here to cut off my hair and donate it to locks of love. while they don't donate the hair themselves anymore, they were still happy to cut it for me to take home and send. my hair dresser was caroline. i had some old color on my layers underneath and they let me know that, because of that, it might not be donatable. but they weren't finished. they talked with me and we figured out a solution. after that part was done, she continued to cut my hair to the pixie cut i wanted. she was very personable and nice. she made sure multiple times that i liked the way she was cutting my hair. she was really caring about me as a person rather than just a head of hair to cut. i'm definitely going back to caroline for all my next haircuts!"
"when we walked in, there was one stylist giving a haircut to the only customer present. we were not acknowledged. as we were sitting, i did notice a computer screen showing the waitlist which was empty. after a few minutes, a couple of people came in and sat poking at their phones. then a couple more. one of the new arrivals was acknowledged by the stylist who asked if he had checked in online. it was then that i noticed 4 names now appearing on the waitlist. another customer entered at this time and she added him to the waitlist. then she asked us if we had checked in online. i said no. she then put us last on the list. the screen said our wait time would be approximately an hour. then she called the first name on the precious list. we had already been waiting 20 minutes. there had been no one on the waitlist when we arrived, and no one waiting. we were invisible customers who needed a good lesson in their system of checking in online. we left. won't be back."
"this is my favorite place to get hair. the staff are great and i never have any problems. my favorite is the manager heather. shes super fun to talk to while i get my cut, and always makes my hair look better than what i thought it would look like."
"i had gone back to this haircut shop as to where a chubby gal named ""stephonie"" did my last haircut, well she talked so much about her kids i felt she never paid attention to my hair. i asked for a layered haircut but she thinned it out and now it is uneven, a total mess. i wanted ""mousse"" to be put in my hair afterwards but she scrunched it with ""men's gel"".this was a total ""no win"" situation for me and my family of five will not go back there again. she was not pleasant @ all when it came time to pay. she tried to ring me up for a blow dry but i reminded her it was the client before me who had a blow dry. not only a rotten haircut but then to get gypped."
"shame on you! my stylist lucia is back at the santee great clips location. when i called that lady i spoke with, whom i believe is the manager, lied and said she didn't know where she went. in the future, my other family members may have used your location. my whole family is in this area. but since it has never been comfortable(owner walking through barking) and you can feel the stress at this location and now you flat out lied, we will not be back!"
"tammie, or tommie, is the manager and the worst hairdresser they have. when you get a horrible haircut, how can you complain and get satisfaction. she doesn't listen to what you want and argues with you about anything you question about the haircut. mine was uneven and crooked on the hairline. she only wants to work fast and get you in and out. don't make the mistake of wasting your money here."
"april 27th, probably the worst service i have ever gotten. i got seated and she asked what i wanted and i asked if i could start with a number 3 on the sides first and shorten it to a 2 if it was too long but she said no. i was confused on why she said no. she did it anyway and gave me a taper down to a 1 1/2 but i didn't even ask for it to be tapered to a 1 1/2. i then asked if she could make that taper to a 1 but she flipped out and was complaining that i was changing my mind too much. i kindly asked if the other lady in the room could do it for me but the lady cutting my hair got even more mad that i said that. she ended up doing it for me anyway. after the haircut, she started mumbling to herself and complaining under her breath. if i could get a refund, i would. long story short, don't get your haircut here lol"
"finally!  a person who listens to what i want!  i recommend jasmine.  i recently moved here, and have gone through several  peeps who had their idea of what i wanted, instead of what i wanted.  i will return.i will say, if the staff there misleads me again as to when my new friend is working, i will stop going there.  when i called in, i was told that she would be there.  turns out when i got there, it was her day off.  i don't reward people who lure me in just to get bucks...  if it happens again, i will move on."
fast and easy to set up an appointment with the iphone app. nice staff with reasonable prices for a regular men's cut and shampoo.
"they only get two stars because they were polite, however my low fade skin was more like a high ""fade"" and they had to switch me to a different chair because the first lady couldn't to a skin fade.  i'll stick to the base barber shop after this. not recommended for military cuts..."
jasmine was a great hair stylist. i've been to this location a few times never once had a bad e ample. will be going back and recommend this location. thanks jasmine
"despite the bad reviews for for this, i decided to give it a try because i thought maybe people were being biased! but i regretted it immediately! i specifically told her i wanted a trim and chopped off 6 inches of my hair... not sure if there was a language barrier or if she was mentally impaired! and the worst part was i told her i wanted ""layered"" hair because my hair is thin and fine and now my hair is all choppy! like who gave this woman her license? i can't believe i paid a fortune in hopes to have a professional cut my hair but i end up looking like a drag queen."
"my boyfriend gets his haircut by lucia and usually loves it, so i decided to give this place a try.  jasmine cut my hair, maybe spent 10 min on it and it's choppy, uneven all over and one side in the front is noticibly longer.  probably one of the worst haircuts i've had.  when she asked if i wanted layers i said no and thank goodness.  i'll be heading somewhere else today to have it fixed."
its all about jasmine! love my hair after coming here as a walk in . found myself asking jasmine to be my stylist as soon as i saw her- her hair style was en trende and her smile and manners were welcoming despite how busy she was. she listened to what i requested and followed through in an amazing amount of time. i'll be back for her. best deal in town!
melanie gave me an awesome style and cut today. highly recommend her for any future style or cuts. she has a great personality and is very attentive to detail. will definitely be coming back!
"went in for the first time because i received a coupon so i figured i'd try them for my son's haircut. he is a year and a half and my friend who is a hair stylist has cut his hair before. because of her busy schedule and the convenient location of this place we went in. seems that the older lady with dark hair and glasses has been there for a while because i read some of the bad reviews today and they seem to be about her. she is grumpy and rude. i walked in first then my husband with our son. my husband accidentally left the door open and the first thing the grump said was 'the door.' that was her way of asking us to close the door behind us. she should just stay in the back. she is probably not the best person to have at the front desk when customers come in and check-in. we were however greeted by the lady who was working to the right closest to the door. she seemed to be the only nice happy person there.  another older lady hair stylist became available and took us. i sat down with my son on my lap. now, this is not my son's first haircut so i know how it should be. the hairstylist seemed annoyed from the beginning. she didnt try to talk to my son or try to slowly start cutting his hair. instead, she just turned on her trimmer, grabbed the top of his head all crazy and went at it. he's a baby so of course he's gonna get scared. she didnt say one word the whole time.  but, the happy lady in the front who had a customer was talking to my son instead. my son's haircut is ok, there's a little patch in the back of his head though. i think i'll stick to my friend cutting his hair or try one of the haircut places designed for kids.if we do ever decide to return for whatever reason, i will definitely go to the lady closest to the door who seemed nice and happy."
"last night was the first time and will be the last time that i bring my son to this place. despite the bad reviews, i still wanted to give it a try, because of the location and their opening hours to 9 pm. just as another review mentioned, people there are not very happy. the  person who cut his hair looked very miserable. the result of her work is awful. the worst hair cut ever had for my son. i had to make apology to my son multiple times, as i took him there. and this place is not cheap either. unless you know someone there is good, it doesn't worth the risk."
went there for my first time recently. location is great. i highly recommend melanie. she is friendly and cares.
the check in app is useless as it showed me 26 mins wait and when i arrived after 30 mins it's still showed 16 mins. also a very overpriced place for the quality of hair cut. you are better off going to a $7 haircut place than coming here.
"on occasion, i come here for my kids to get their haircuts, but it's pretty much because it's the closest place and they're open until 9pm.  they are overpriced unless you have a $9.99 coupon, or one of those promo discount cards you can buy from local high school students for fundraising...with those you get $2 off, so it's still $14 for a basic cut and no shampoo.  the stylists sometimes make you second guess your style requests.  i don't appreciate that especially when i show them a photo of what i want for my boys.  it's like they don't want to put any effort into the style for kids.  nobody seems happy to be working there either.  that's the vibe i get anyway.  2 stars for convenience."
"i have been here in last 4 years at least 15 times. and every time i come i experience the customer service less better than the previous time! i got in today and no one said ""welcome to great clips"". however all the white people that came in after me get to hear that !!many a times i have been asked questions like - where am i from ? where do i work ? am i an engineer ? lot of engineers from india. 4s ranch lot of indians. and rather than focusing on my hair cut i have to involve myself into such unwanted conversations! sweetie .. i am just looking for a decent hair cut !! if you choose to hold scissors and i choose to hold books in my hand .. there is nothing much i can do about it ! we need a re-org / new leadership for sure!"
michael - really nice haircut and attention to detail.  i'll go back again when in san diego.
"second time here and they were great again! evelyn helped me out today and she was super helpful (and friendly)! we consulted for 10 minutes and it took about 20 minutes to cut. she kept asking me what i thought about this and that, making sure i was happy with what she was doing. 5 stars to evelyn :)"
lauren and everyone else that works here are solid gold. can't find a nicer place to get a hair cut.
great clips always makes us look pretty! shohreh is awesome- my husband looks like a new man when comes out with his new haircut.
"definitely stay away. i made the mistake of coming here, but i hope you take your $20 elsewhere. a lady cut my hair and i gave her pictures for reference but she simply could not understand the style i was hoping for. and the style i wanted was what i already had, just a shorter trimmed version. her manager can see this so he comes out (really nice white guy) and pulls her aside to explain how to perform this experiment (for her it truly was, an experiment) on my head but she completely misses the mark, and then tells me towards the end that she needs to go get her glasses because she could never see the picture clearly. this is the part of the experiment where the scientist realizes that he did not in fact find a cure to cancer for humans, instead for snails. he was looking at snails the whole time. he simply forgot to wear his glasses. good for the snails though. i was left dumbfounded and so i curtly mention on her return that maybe glasses before the cut next time (if ever i am truly feeling clinically insane to decide to come back) would be better. in a dismissive tone i hear ""oh it's okay honey, you have everything to gain nothing to lose as your hair will grow back!"" this is like going to the bakery, eating rotten bread, and being told ""but food poisoning only lasts a couple of days!"" it's cool though, i guess she's right, it'll grow back, can't argue there no i can't, but i'll need to be able to explain why i resemble a hairless cat.notable mentions: - bald spot on the back of my head. looks botched. but it will grow back, right?! perhaps a new motto for you greatclips. ""we're not sorry it will grow back"" - the lady seemed insufferable. she is angry at the world. not to downplay her own problems, however, they can be fair and real, just simply not appropriate for the workplace. i'm scared of her around sharp objects, to say the least. - she asked if i was doing ""okay"" at least 15 times. a ""yes"" each time was politely replied but i was most certainly lying by the 7th one. excessive. - she asked me to read out the expiry on my coupon as, of course, she could not see it,  because yes her glasses were off again. a wild experience. customer service and the service itself is embarrassing, please don't make the mistake of coming here."
"what am i doing here ?? spur of the moment...thanks to fellow elite yelper, kenna h. for recommending this place !!! oh wait it's been years since i've been here. location/setting:-located at a shopping center near bbb and ralphs-plenty of parking-small hair salon (don't expect high-end decor)-there is a check-in monitor/screen that tells you where you are on the waiting list. nice feature. they call your name when it's your turn.customer service:-the young lady who greeted me seemed liked the unhappiest person on earth. geez. a smile wouldn't hurt.-my hairdresser was quite pleasant though. i think her name was evelyn..a nice older filipina lady.-i usually am iffy about these places..i mean you get what you pay for, but i just wanted a trim and she did a pretty good job. through dying and flat ironing, i was having hair dilemmas. i had major dry split ends so i wanted a mini hair makeover. she was very attentive and wanted to make sure that i knew exactly what she was going to do. i wanted to keep my hair medium length. she took off a good 3 inches and cleaned up my layers from before. i must say it made a huge difference. my dead ends are gone ! yay !-i also had her shampoo my hair. great mini massage too. the whole process took less than 30 minutes.additional info:-for $20 not too shabby. i wish i had a coupon. i hear they have $5 off coupons all the time so keep an eye out for those.-if you check-in online (or use great clips app.), you won't have to wait too long, but since this was a random spur of the moment thing, i had to wait for 15-20 minutes on a saturday. not too bad considering there were a few people ahead of me already seated in the waiting area.- convenient ! you're in and out quick so it's great if you're in a rush.- reasonable hours - open 7 days/weekverdict:i got lucky this time around. i'm sure it's a hit or miss depending on who you get. if you aren't too picky with haircuts (keep it simple) and in a rush then i'm sure they can do a decent job. don't expect high end salon treatment. they want you in and out."
shohreh is the bomb! she does fantastic cuts! can always count on her. she's my girl!
shohreh is awesome!!!! she is a pro & gives a meticulous haircut!! the wait for her is always worth it. she listens & does exactly what you request. so lucky to have found her!! have been going  to her for the past 6 years. people stop me all the time & ask me where i get my haircut. her expertise is reflected in the professional haircuts she gives. she is also a beautiful & wonderful person!!! thank you shohreh!!!
my wife just got her haircut (she thinks the person's name was kendra) and said the hairstylist was very nice and did a great job communicating everything she was doing.
"i've been going to rich for years now, although he is in various locations and i have to track him down when i need a cut.  i have total strangers stop me frequently when i am out and about admiring my cut and asking where i get it done.  i always recommend great clips for the price and results."
i've gone there several times. was ok in the past but lately has gone downhill. if you want a bad haircut chances are you will get one there...
"had such a wonderful experience here. i had the luck of having rich cut my hair and i am beyond happy with not only the cut he did but the amazing person that he is. great salon, awesome service and incredible haircut! i came from an hour away and will continue to do so as long as rich is around!"
"due to numerous bad haircut experiences, i had pretty much given up on going to any more great clips locations. but i'm glad i gave it one more try. richard, the general manager at this location, also cuts hair. i've used him a couple of times and he gets it right. so now i just call ahead and will only go when he's working. since they don't take appointments, i just let him know when i'll be there and then check in online. no more crooked or too short haircuts for me. the parking lot here gets crowded.they accept competitor's coupons, as long as they're not expired. as long as richard is working here, i'll continue to come here. thanks for the great and affordable haircut!"
sarah has been cutting my hair for several months now. when i relocated to del sur it took quite a few tries to find someone who would pay attention to the way i want my hair cut. sarah is very attentive and consistently cuts my hair as i request.
"warning...there is an incompetent hairdresser on the loose at this salon and her name is christina.  she lost control of her razor and failed to point this out to my son and never showed him the back of his head. shame on you christina! at least be an adult and inform your clients' of your mistakes.  it wasn't until he drove home when we noticed the two bald spots. not only is she incompetent with  the razor but also shares inappropriate information with clients. my son said when another male customer walked into the salon she said, ""phew, glad i didn't get him, he is too picky"".  i'm guessing he too once suffered under the sheers of christina.consider yourself warned."
"if i could put a 0* i would. i've never seen my husband's hair like this. it's completely uneven all around his head. maybe they should clip dog hair?  anyways, not going back for sure!"
"my fiancé came and got a haircut here yesterday. the person who cut his hair was ngoc. she did not do a good job w his hair. we came home and i saw that his hair was uneven! she completely missed the right side of his head. i didn't go in w him the first time and i didn't see it initially since i wasn't there. we came back in to get it fixed and she didn't even remember cutting his hair. then, she was unhappy to fix it!i showed her where it was uneven and she said ""no, it's straight. you see?"" as she continues to cut his hair. if it's even like you claimed...then why are you still cutting? then once she was done ""fixing"" it, she started cleaning her clippers as he sat there in the chair. we were not even sure if he was done because she didn't say anything except looked angry and left him hanging. we will not be back. terrible service. avoid ngoc at all cost. she will mess up your hair!"
"another spur of the moment hair adventure !!!i never noticed this place existed. it's been here for a few years and i've been going to studio barre classes next door. doh ! like other great clips locations, it's a hit or miss on who you get if you don't have a regular hairstylist. i decided to take that risk again since i had a good experience at another location.location:-easy to find; off the 56 freeway-plenty of parking-small and clean saloncustomer service:-friendly, fast, and efficienti didn't have an appointment booked nor did i check-in online. i was expecting a wait, but surprisingly i was called in right away. it was also thursday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all. the lady at the front greeted me and took my information. apparently, they didn't have my record in the system even though i've been to another great clips. they are all connected.my hairstylist was renee (i think) and she was super down to earth and cool as can be !! she had a very hip hairdo that i personally couldn't get away with, but she rocked it ! i was considering going drastic myself, but instead opted for a few inches off instead. haha i know..boring !!!i am super low maintenance when it comes to my hair. recently, i've stopped dying and flat ironing my hair since it was drying out and causing me to get major split ends. i'm finally nurturing my hair back into good health. renee was open to hearing about my concerns and trimmed off more of my split ends and added more layers to my hair. in my opinion, medium-length hair seems to suit me best rather than long hair. i got a nice shampoo/conditioner and massage as well. throughout the whole process, renee was very professional with hair recommendations and i easily trusted her judgement. it was super quick and i was in and out in less than 30 minutes. great for those who are in a rush. don't get me wrong though. she was meticulous and knew what she was doing. i was very pleased.total came to $20 plus tip. not too shabby ! i have yet to find those great clips coupons everyone is talking about.if ever i want a simple cut, i will never go to a high-end salon for that anymore. great clips does a decent job for a fraction of the price."
"i take my boys here exclusively for their hair cuts. there's a reason. they get the job done right. you can check-in online using their app. and it shortens the wait because you can come in when you think they'll call you. the app will tell you there's a 30 minute wait, for example, and you can adjust your arrival time accordingly. they almost always get you in, if you checked-in online, at the time they estimated for your wait.also, they take competitor's coupons, but no coupons printed off the internet.  so be aware and look through those free mailers that come to your house. i almost always use a coupon and always tip well because frankly, they deserve it!"
"yikes, hubby came home piiiiiiiiiissssssed. i have never seen him so upset over a haircut before. as my last review stated, christina was the only good person he had here (pq/rb never gave him good haircuts) but she left a long time ago. so he went back today, i guess to give them another chance, plus he had a coupon.he had the middle aged asian lady worker who barely spoke english, and didn't listen to anything he said of how he wanted his haircut. he has super easy hair to cut, by the way.she took way too much off and he told her that she didn't listen to anything i said. no apology, no nothing (probably cuz she couldn't understand him lol)...he came in the house and i told him ""honey, wear a hat for the next couple of weeks"" lol....this should've been comped. i saw the haircut. no way he should've paid for that garbage. and i can't believe he still tipped her. my hubby is way too nice. personally, i would've complained to the manager. he is still pissed lol i better give him some cookies to calm him down.he said he will never go back there ever again...but he said it in more colorful language. all right yelpers, you've been warned."
"took my 2 year old there today for a hair cut. he was being a normal child who doesn't like hair cuts! crying a lot but i was holding him. the hairdresser said ""is it nap time?"" ""you are being crazy"" to my son. she was very rude to him and i. didn't deserve to get paid at all for her words. if you cant handle cutting children's hair then don't!!"
"i *always* know there *must* be a gimmick when you see a haircut being flashed around for only $8.99. there must be a 'read fine print' somewhere. or maybe there should be that fine print somewhere on all their $8.99 haircut banners. we were in this shopping plaza the other day and the bf wanted a quick hair cut. he's been to sports clip which he likes. i think he said their haircuts start at $20.it was pretty busy at this great clips location that early afternoon. we went in and i inquired about the $8.99 price. the young receptionist, who was nice, asked us to fill out an info card which i politely declined as we were only there asking about the price and there's no need for them to get our personal info. she still didn't know the details about the $8.99 so she asked one of the stylist. the young girl then said yes, $8.99 for a haircut. i asked if that included a shampoo perhaps? and she had to ask another stylist who whispered to her 'no, it's haircut only'. i think a shampoo is an additional $4-6 dollars or so. alright. no biggie. there's the fine print for me. fine. she quoted a 15 min wait so we put our name in (and yes filled out info card) and went next door to peet's to grab a coffee. 10 min later we came back and was told another 10-15 min. jeez. when it was bf's turn to get haircut, it didn't take long (maybe 12-15 min). he said he was happy with the haircut and the girl was pleasant & friendly. we found it pretty cute they handed him a hand(pre)written thank you card with a discount card also included. nice touch. bf said that he'd give the place 4 stars for the cut but agreed 3 stars for initial confusion (of price) and longer wait than what was quoted. i didn't realize this place takes online reservations (?) so maybe that's the way to go when you visit this location."
"zachary is ""the best"" for my husband who is 87.  he's patient and goes the extra mile by not rushing, making sure my husband's ideas are possible, and even trims his eyebrows and ears without asking.  he's so kind, as well as accomplished in what my husband wants, that we've followed him around to various locations for a few years now."
"i'll never go back there again! the barber cut off more than i asked. this happened twice and it was by the same person. i wasn't happy with the haircut back in june.  i went there 2 days ago hoping to get somebody else, but she was the only one available at that time. i decided to give her another chance. to avoid any misunderstanding i repeated my request to cut half an inch off the top part of my hair. i emphasized repeatedly ""no more than half an inch!"" but, what did she do? she cut off way too much again! you fool me once, shame on you. fool me twice,...never that place again!!!"
amara is very outgoing and comforting! i came in clueless about my hair but she gave me so much helpful information! ask for her when you come in here! the place is very welcoming and clean! will definetly return!
"i went in yesterday - feb 2 around 4:30 ish to get a simple trim done . i was greeted by christina who asked me to fill out a info card since it was my first time there . i only went here bc it's around the corner from my house and my dad recommended it. i was seated within 15 from me walking in and melania took care of me - she was amazing and listened to what i wanted. i'm giving it a 2 star due to christina making a racist comment to melania. melania is from columbia and like any other immigrant has an accent when speaking english . as melania spoke christina decide to say "" what are you saying ? speak english "" - mind you everyone understood what melania said. i turned around and did give christina a dirty look and said that was unnecessary. then christina decided to say that melania reminded her of a child learning to speak for the first time- that's when i was ready to go. i don't tolerate any type of racism or down playing someone's intelligence . first of all-i'm an immigrant and i took it very personal due to my own experiences. secondly, this is your job - act professional. thirdly, christina if this is what you teach your kids at home be ready for a rude awakening."
"okay, so i got my hair cut each month here for about two years. why am i rating them two stars (and never going back ever again)? they have about 2-3 good staff members and the rest are a major inconvenience. rookies to people who can barely speak english, you name it. just go somewhere else."
ive been coming to great clips for a long time now and just had the manager cut my kids hair. zachary was so amazing with all my kids. we will definitely be back and i highly recommend this great clips and zachary.
i reviewed this place 22 days ago but it's not showing up. i popped in today since i was next door getting coffee and the air conditioning is still broken. it felt like a swet shop in there. how dare they make the staff work in those conditions. the girl told me it was 88degrees inside.
i started going here for convenient location but have since come to realize their service is great too.   i highly recommend.
milena was very nice and efficient in giving my haircut on a sunday morning (they save my settings too)!
"i never notice this place before, but i was in dire need of a haircut and dropped in without an appointment.  they took me in right away and put me in the hands of kirsten (sp?), a young lady from texas.  she did exactly what i asked for, and actually improved on it just a little.  best haircut i have had in 10 years.  i will definitely be back.  this is my new favorite place for haircuts,"
"my three kids have been going to zach at torrey highlands for about 3 hair cuts and he has always done an excellent job!  we like him so much that we followed him from another great clips that is closer to us.  he is kid friendly, precise, efficient, and we love their hair when it is done.  we check in with the app and hardly have to wait.  today my 2nd son was already getting his hair cut by the time my daughter  and i walked in."
great service today from natsumi.  her technique was exceptional with exacting skill and attention to detail.   she is our good to stylist at great clips!
"this review is in regards to a visit to this location on october 5, 2017.  i checked in as usual through the app and arrived at the salon around 12:15pm.at this time there were two women working, one with longer green-black hair and tattoos and another slightly older with shorter grayish hair.  the older woman finished cutting her clients hair, had him pay, and then immediately said ""ok sir, i'm ready. you can come on back.""i followed her back and just as i expected from the immediate turn around the floor was just covered in hair from at least 1 haircut but it looked like more.  there was also a neck ribbon or two lying among all the hair.  i stood back a few feet to give her the opportunity to clean up, as i assumed she may have just forgot and wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt.  after about 10-15 seconds she looks at me (which she stands in piles of hair) and says ""are you coming?"".  at this point i said ""i can't do this."" and walked out, absolutely disgusted.  after a minute i decided it would be best to go back in to provide feedback as a courtesy.  all she said was ""are you ready?"" the floor was still covered in hair with zero attempt to clean up.  when i stated my concern she said ""you never gave me a chance to clean up."" which is a brazen lie.  that is exactly why i stood back in the first place.i am not a germaphobe or someone with a compulsive aversion to unclean situations, but i was dumbfounded (not to mention this is a california health code violation).  my grandmother owned a small salon in rural ohio for almost 40 years and my mother owned another for many years.  i have grown up in them and pride myself on always appreciating the hard work stylists put in.  this experience has also primed me as to what i should expect from a salon and this is not it.i have been going to great clips for nearly 10 years in 2 different states and this is far and away the worst experience i have ever had with this (or any other) salon.  i can say with certainty i will never again venture to this location."
first time going to this place.i would go back any day they give really good haircuts! the people here are very friendly and do there job very well.crystal does amazing work she is a very good hair stylist....
"when you get home and have to fix your own hair, you know it's a bad haircut.  i don't know if the ""stylist"" was having a bad day but she didn't seem to care about my hair for one second.  i asked for a few touch ups and she balked at my suggestions stating that my hair will look bad.  well, my hair did look bad.  as i was driving home, i reached to the back of my head to find a huge clump of hair that she clearly missed.  on top of that, she missed a few other spots that i could easily identify with just a mirror and a comb at my house.  i would highly advise to look anywhere else.  the only reason it isn't 1 star is the tv in the waiting area is a nice touch."
"crystal is amazing!!! i seriously only let her touch my hair. i could go anywhere to get my hair cut but why would i when she is the best! i couldn't be happier that i don't have to spend an arm and leg at some fancy salon, yet get even better results than when i have. crystal just happens to manage great clips, but i would follow her anywhere. she knows exactly what and how i want my hair, as i'm extremely particular. i am forever being complimented on her work. thank you crystal for being a part of making me feel beautiful! i'll be seeing you soon!"
"if i could leave 0 stars i would. i have been trying to grow my hair out for over a year to have an asymetrical angled bob. today was going to be the day..... psych!i usually see a nice black lady but she gave me to a fat white lady with glasses. which i didnt mind. i figured since i am fat too she would give me the cut i wanted and make me look good for my interview i haad later that day. we discussed what i wanted. i was very clear, stacked in back, angled to my jaw on the right and angled and just take off the dry end on the left. she said she would have to take off maybe an inch on the left... shorter than i wanted but fine. i waited forntgis haircut for a year. my hair grows super slow.first i had to ask for a shampoo, she was just going to spray my unwashed hair down.shampoo done, she has to use the restroom. fine, she took like 10 minutes in the restroom. whatever... nature calls you gotta answer.she then combs my hair and clips and reclips my hair. finally starts cutting. she cutsbthe back then on to the short side. she cuts that super blunt and not angled.she goes to the long side and tells me she can't do it. what?! what do you mean you can't do it?? she said it will have to be a lot shorter on the long side. i told her i didnt wantbit to look like my haed was cocked when it was cut. i wanted a visable difference. after she cut the long side shorter, it looked maybe a half inch longer than the short side. i was upset and told her just to even out the cut. i started crying. she didnt notice and just kept cutting and finally asked if i was crying, really you needed to ask? i looked up and saw she also cut blunt with no angle. i started crying harder. she asked what was wrong. i told her this was not the cut i wanted, it was not angled in front, and she started to argue with me. seriously telling me that i never told her that i wanted angeld sides.i got up and told her we were done. threw some money on her station and proceeded to take the cape off.the black lady offered to try and fix it nut i had no more time and my hair was entirely too short now, so i didn't want any more cutting.horrible experience! you never argue or patronize the person in the chair. i have been a hairdresser for 10 years and what she told me was incorrect. it could have been done, an experienced hairdresser knows how to do it. now i have another year of growing out to do.thanks."
"my experience at this location was very good. i had frankie for my stylist, and she was great. she definitely made me feel like more than just an ordinary customer and genuinely interested in actually getting to know me as a person. i will definitely be back."
great customer service here!!! no wait when other shops had over an hour. stephanie did a wonderful job with my son as he gets ready to go into high school. he looks great and she gave the exact cut he wanted.tina did my hair and exceeded my expectations as she trimmed my ear hair and eyebrows. this was the first haircut shop in which i experienced this style of customer service. we'll definitely return to this location for our hair cuts. tina also gave us a discount. well done ladies!!!
"frankie is a great stylist/haircutter for a few special reasons. she has a fabulous eye for what style would work for​ a person. she listens to me and allows​ me to offer my sometimes ""not so good ideas"" and follows my wishes. when i realize i didn't make the best choice she just gets me back on the right track. all of this with a smile and a caring attitude. i trust her with her choices for me and that means a great deal! like others, my appearance is very important to my sense of self-worth​. i get so many compliments about my haircut. so glad i found her. she is great to talk to as well (smile)."
among the worst visits to a hair cut spot. lady just read some notes in her computer from my last visit 2yrs ago. did not ask me how i would like it cut... did not ask me if i was happy after the cut... which by the way took less than 15mins. no artistic effort - just chop chop!  the lady wore glasses and squinted a bunch - i'm not going back. 2 stars because at least the place was clean and plenty of parking.
"i came here without an appointment. haircuts are $17, child and seniors are $15. the place is very clean and organized. the haircut station is on the left hand side and shampooing station is on the right hand side. they clean up the hair after every client and they greet you as soon as you walk in. today was kind of busy considering the long weekend and everyone is trying to look sharp for the bbq pool party tomorrow! :) i had britney today and she was very good and bubbly. i will be happy to return! my hair looks great and healthy again!"
"great location, and crystal is the best! she's always quick to respond and does an outstanding job every time."
"great place really, i'm pretty particular about my hair. i never thought great clips would be my regular to-go place. i always get skin fades and ""trickier"" cuts, which atendestes hard to find to satisfaction for around $20. but every time i come in i leave with a smile on my face because the girls here do a great job! very nice and professional people. definitely look for frankie, she did the best fade last time i was there. thumbs up for people who actually care what your hair looks like."
i've been here a few times and they've always done a great job.  my boyfriend comes here regularly and only once did some girl do a funky job but that's pretty good considering how often he's gone.today i donated hair and they were really careful with making the measurements.  i also got my hair cut for free because they are a locks of love salon.  ann helped me and she was very mindful of the exact length i wanted.  she suggested layers and i love them.  she was great.i really don't understand going to expensive places for a cut.  this place is just as good!
"i stopped here to get my sons hair cut.  the lady who helped him wasn't very polite at all.  she kept hersef busy texting on th phone and talking to her colleague while trying to cut my boys hair.  i don't mind if they have to answer the stores phone calls but its very unprofessional to be on their personal cell phone while taking care of a customer.  hair cut was messy, not the way we wanted it and she did not even bother to clean the hairs around his ears, neck and forehead... not nice."
"had to get a haircut before my drill weekend. i got a 2 on the sides and a 4 on the top with a line up. i stopped in and the woman that cut my hair did an absolutely horrible job she spent about 15 minutes, my lineup was literally uneven, my hair looked ragged. why did i allow this to happen? she didn't even provide me with a hand mirror to inspect the cut, she instantly put gel on her palms, slicked my hair into a comb over and charged me $14 with what she said was a ""great price for military"" and apparently $18 regular. do not come here.. save yourself the trouble and drive up balboa to amdine barber shop. they have great service, great reviews and consistent quality."
"i recommend this place for my mother not too long ago, i had a fairly good experience. well, she told me the blonde lady who cut her hair kept telling my mother how tiring it was to cut her hair. um, isn't that your job?  how disrespectful and unprofessional. keep your thoughts to yourself."
i love getting my hair cut here. the stylists are all so friendly and do an amazing job. i've been to so many different hair cutting places and great clips (this one in particular) is by far the most affordable and you leave feeling like a million bucks!  i feel lucky that this place is so close to where i live.  thanks ladies!!!
got the military cut with a 2 on sides on longer on top. the woman who cut my hair said she had 37 years of experience...i got home and my hair line was jacked. none of my fade was even and the blending was awful. worst haircut i've ever received. i went up to the scripps ranch location and luckily they fixed it for me for free. i don't do yelp reviews much so that tells you how awful this cut was!
trang did an awesome job on my hair. at first i was nervous because i'm new to town and it was my first haircut in san diego. when she was done i was a little bit skeptical because she did it so quickly but i have friends telling me it's one of the best haircuts i've ever had. she saw that i wasn't happy at first and told me i didn't have to pay. i felt bad because she did a great job. i'll definitely go back to her again.
"i've come in to this great clips location twice in the last few months, and all i have to say is wow.the first time i came in was to fix a haircut that was done poorly by another (not great clips) shop. christiano did an amazing job fixing it, and even though it was busy i was in and out quickly.the second time i came in was for a normal haircut and it was months later. christiano remembered me personally and once again the service was fantastic. he even trimmed my beard. i will continue going here for my cuts, and highly recommend them!"
this place is awesome!!! walked in and was out in no time!!! the staff is amazing and the price was great. christiano (manager) has a phenomenal personality and his staff is very kind and helpful. we shared some laughs and i totally felt like i was at home. my best hair experience here in california by far! this is a great cohesive team on the rise. thank you so much christiano for the trim and layers!!! keep up the great work :) morgan witherspoon
i came in and did not realize the coupon was a week expired. they did not honor the coupon. i ended up paying $18 for the hair cut. with tips i paid $20 for a hair cut. i am cheap. i've never paid for more than $15 hair cut.
this great clips is well...great! the staff was friendly on the phone and when i arrived. they are also knowledgable and cut my hair well. i felt welcome and that my business was appreciated. online check in was very convenient. i will definitely be returning.
"this may be a great hidden secret for a good, reasonable hair cut. i took my son to this location late one weeknight because the great clips we usually go to had a 23 minute wait. so we checked-in online at this location close to our house. there was no one in there except for the two hair stylists. ruben cut my son's hair. he did an amazing job. he knew exactly what to do to make my son's hair look good and i didn't have to tell him much of anything. just confirmed his usual.i made sure to find out when he works and he told me that he usually works nights. great. i'll plan on coming back with my other son!"
very nice haircut place i always come here . zakia was super nice and took the best care of me . i got a fresh haircut and will be back!super fast too
"i just got home with my son and i want to cry. i explained to the lady who called us to her chair that he has autism and doesn't always respond to verbal commands......she then took it upon herself to buzz his head, she had already run the clippers across his head before i could even utter a word. we never ask for clippers because my son has a few cowlicks and keeping it a bit longer helps. i walked in to show my neighbor and she immediately noticed all the uneven areas on his head. i would go complain but he's 3 and it will grow back. i just know now i need a new place to take him."
got a great haircut from cheri at great clips tonight. she knows how to blend the sides to the top really well. i got exactly the haircut i wanted and my wife liked it too. always a plus.
"yelp reviews are rarely checked before one goes, eats or visits a location. it it used to find places and some will browse reviews, but most are smart enough to know that people have opinions.... and opinions are like... yada yada yada.... you know the rest.  soooo here is my opinion.   service is... ok. a few stylist that cant cut hair right to save their lives, but most are decent and a couple are really good. but not worth $18! so if i have a coupon or special... yep, i will go. otherwise you can get same service or better pretty much anywhere in the 10 mi radius of this location.  they have huge turn around here and most saturday afternoons.. its dead! so that says a lot. try for yourself... again, just my opinion."
"this place is fucking ass, i use to always go here. not anymore, i've had to redo my hair again just because people here don't know how to cut."
came here to this location for the first time and impressed with the quick service. zakia was really good. she is quick and gave me a great haircut. and also told what kinds of hairstyle i can do in future. i am definitely coming back to her
came here for the first time today on a recommendation and i was very happy with my haircut.  ruben did a great job and i really enjoyed his expertise and customer service. i'll be back. the salon was very nice and clean too.   cori went back for a second time. i was charged way too much. felt like bait and switch to me. it cost much higher than i expected because of the higher prices.  cori
"they have messed up my hair on multiple occasions, but have offered to fix it for free. might come again, prices are okay."
ive come here multiple times and i am very satisfied with the haircuts they give me. they are friendly and make you feel comfortable. i've been coming here for a while now. my hair cuts are all done by the barber rubenes never messed up my hair.
"ruben cut my hair tonight. he did a great job. i'm a previous customer from the poway location by target. due to lack of customer service and one stylist that smelled like an ash tray i am no longer going to go there. thanks ruben, best haircut i've had in a very long time!!!"
i usually don't have the best experiences when i just walk in to have my sons hair cut but when ruben cuts it.....always on point!! i hope and pray is there everytime i go.  from now on im just going to call and make sure first.  he is so personable and always doing his best to make sure everyone is happy!! ask for ruben!!!
it's so hard to find a great hair stylist!  been shuffling between various locations and people!  i got a haircut at a different location and they messed up my hair!  then came into this location the next day to get my hair redone and ruben helped me out and did a fantastic job!  he did such an awesome job i would recommend him to anyone and everyone!  still come to get my haircut and will always request ruben!  thank you great clips and especially ruben for the great fantastic haircut!!!
i have been going to this great clips since 2007 and i have to say i have been satisfied until today. today's visit was awful. i felt like i was being pressured into buying products. all i wanted was to go in for a trim and to leave. i was not only being pressured by the stylist but also by a manager which i thought was rude in more than one way. he made a comment about my gray hair that i didn't appreciate and he also was talking to my stylist about a mistake she made prior to helping me. i thought he could have waited until she was done trimming my hair before talking to her. because of these experiences i think i may find a new place.
"everyone was nice,i left thinking that the cut i had was good, until i got home. my wife pointed out a lot of big chop and uneven, just careless work. i wont be returning there.i would name the stylist but maybe she was having a bad day on my cut, none the least inexcusable.i went to your competitor to get it straightened out. tayler"
"i've been coming to the location for the last 2 months for 1 reason and 1 reason only: ruben. he cuts your hair so gently and precisely. i used to go to a different great clips location, only 5 minutes from my house, but once i heard ruben moved locations to rancho, i go here every time, even though it's 25 min from my house now."
very responsive to our needs as a family and myself as a professional working in hospital.
"i am responding to this because a couple people have unfairly characterized jacqui, a hairstylist i have been seeing for about ten years now. i simply will not allow anyone else to cut my hair. over the last ten years my hair style hasn't changed much, slight tweaks here and there to keep up with the times. but one thing that has never changed is my satisfaction with jacqui's work. i honestly can't review anyone else at this great clips because she's the only one i will see."
"i always come to this location and always end up with a great haircut and shampoo, love love this place....."
i usually go to this place for my haircuts. i'm pretty satisfied with all my haircut experiences here (4 or 5 times so far). it's clean. easy to check-in. i get my haircut by kim. she's friendly and does a good job. very comfortable place to get my simple haircut.
fast hair cut...un friendly lady...doesn't say a word...she handles the clipper and scissors like she is force to cut my hair. i will never...ever go back to that place
worst hair cut ever.asian lady is so horrible . she made my hair exotremely short. i have asked her to do something else and she has done like man hair cut. she is horrible .i m planning to complain about her to the great clips head quarter and make her fire .
"my husband took our 5 year old son to great clips for a haircut this week. they have a sign in their window saying ""military discount"" . when my husband went to pay for the haircut he showed his military id but was told the discount is not for dependants.  won't be going to great clips anymore!"
i get my hair cut here and every time i think i want to try somewhere else i end up coming back here to get my hair fixed. i have had just about everyone here cut my hair and they are all really good. i absolutely love yafa though. love. love. love. love. she is awesome! she's also really honest when i need opinions about anything so its nice talking to her while getting my hair cut. this place is really cheap for a hair cut and i really don't understand how they only have 2 stars on yelp. i don't dye my hair so i can't comment on that aspect but the cuts are solid. i also really enjoy getting the conditioning treatments here. they make my hair feel super soft and silky after. i also love that while i'm here they never try to push products on me. the staff is also very patient with all my strange and untraditional requests for random cuts here and there.
this is the worst place i have ever been too. my hair looks like a freaking lawn mower went over my head. the tall black lady(jackie) had no idea what she was doing!!! she was careless didnt even listen to what i wanted just started hacking away... not only does my hair look like crap but when she was cutting my hair she was flinging her scissors around could have cut me if they feel off her fingers. no blending done to my hair when i got home i had to have my roommates fixed all extra long areas... do not go here. i had to call and complain to the manager. horrible !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"this great clips is my hole in the wall, quick touch up spot. it's almost always not busy, very easy to just stroll in and sit right down. place is pretty clean, minus the location on the side of the strip mall. the employees are okay. not very chatty and don't look like they like what they do. i wouldn't choose this location for any major hair job. quick touch ups, yeah stop by."
"where to start? the russian woman is great, and does a good job. don't even considering seeing anyone else. they seem to train a lot of people, there are usually 2 to 4 people there who don't even know to work the clippers. my brothers haircut is usually pretty terrible, but this time it took the cake. she spent 30 minutes cutting his hair without clippers, and when she used the clippers on his neck she took a chunk out of the line and just left it. see attached picture. didn't know how to work the register, confirming that she was another trainee. there's one good woman there, but she is always busy so don't even dream about walking in and finding her available."
"ok , old ladies in as stylist they don't understand english they know traditional way of cutting onlycannot do what pictures u show them .  was not satisfied hm they did not blow drive wholly too hm"
"i've gotten my hair cut by four of the different stylist/barbers and they are without a doubt the best i've been to. i can speak from personal experience that if you get your hair cut by jackie (i know i spelled this wrong), kim or debbie you will not be disappointed. love this spot!"
"we've been coming to this great clips for a few years, and they always do a good job. my wife gets her hair cut by kim and she always loves it! for men it's fast too, and they don't try to up sell you with unnecessary stuff which is great. can't beat the price either."
we took our daughter for an emergency fix hair cut here after someone at the pb location butchered her haircut. melissa was wonderful and somehow salvaged my daughters hair. we are grateful for her help!
"kim is the best, always a good haircut. she is super friendly and does a great job. check in online and save yourself some time."
"i walked in and it was empty, so that was different from my usual hairdresser. i showed her a picture of what i wanted and told her i would like 5 inches cut off. instead of 5 inches she doubled of what i had asked for! aside from that it was nothing like the picture! besides that the hairdresser was also rude. you're better off getting a pair of scissors for home and cutting it yourself instead of spending money here. they ruined my hair, do not come here!"
"i had a very bad experience today. the lady with russian accent cut my hair today. i like my hair to be short. i have clearly mentioned 6 on the top, 2 and 1 on the sides. instead of cutting with scissors, she used a machine with 5!!!  what the heck is that. she did not put any care in cutting my hair properly. she tried to finish the job asap. i have to look into mirror and ask her to cut the hair properly. i strongly recommend to avoid this lady with russian accent."
"the price is reasonable and comparable with other barber shops for a short male-cut.i usually go to the happy barber on clairmont mesa, but this is now closer for me. this is a perfect place to take my two little kids; i can't comment on anyone but quin (formerly nguyen) who did a great job with my 3 yr old and 9 month old. with a coupon, the price is pretty much the same as happy barber. i haven't tried the online booking feature and haven't had a problem as a walk in."
literally the worst place ever for a haircut. there is a russian of slovakian lady who has no idea what she is doing at all. do not go here. ever. she botched my hair completely
"i've been here twice now and both times got major haircuts from long (10+ inches) to pixie. both times i had great experiences and was very happy with the results.samantha cut my hair this last time i went, and she was very patient taking her time on the cut and humoring my special requests. she checked in at various steps to ensure that i was on board with what she was doing, and also offered helpful suggestions from length of the bangs to styling products.would go back!"
"came here looking for a last minute haircut (short, curly hair) before school starts. we were greeted promptly and serviced after waiting less than 5 minutes. my daughter was nervous about getting a cut by a man but her nerves were quickly calmed after chatting with mark before her cut. he understood exactly what she was looking for and executed it to the t. she loved her wash and the delicate care of her cut. we will definitely be back for a cut with mark. thank you."
jessica took her time with me and gave me a great cut. my hair came out better than some cuts that i've gotten from barbers who charge twice as much. thanks jessica! i feel great
this was my first time at this location and i was in need of haircut. i wanted to do a simple medium length cut and i showed my hairstylist jessica a picture of what i wanted. she was very friendly and made great suggestions which i was open to. she gave me the cut i wanted as well as making sure it framed my face shape. in the end i liked the way it turned out and i would come back to maintain my haircut.
"if you want a bitchy stuck up woman who probably learned how to cut hair out of a coloring book, get your haircut here."
"absolutely horrendous, i walked in for a haircut and i walked out looking like an egg."
long story short.. i got a skin fade 0 to 3 on top.. but never got the fade haha came back lady looked at me like she never heard a fade before i just walked out and hit up another barber shop
terrible haircut!stylist very timid and seemed afraid to even cut hair. bad fading and edging. could have gotten a better haircut in the barracks. marines do not come here. overpriced and really bad quality.
"great service! anna was extremely efficient and quick, plus was spot on with the hair cut! will come back!!!"
"horrible hair salon..we went there for my husband's haircut , he mentioned specifically many times to keep the length and they just blindly cut everything with clipper..didnt even use scissors..why pay 20 bucks for something we can do at home only .they dont understand customer requirements at all..v disappointed.."
"jamshid did an excellent job! just got my hair cut today and i've already gotten a few compliments on it tonight. i've always had a great experience regardless of who does my hair at this location but i was especially pleased with jamshid's styling. he's cute, too."
absolutely horrible customer service! walked in was told they had people who checked in a head of me so had to check in and wait even though no one was in the store... 3 people working but two were on the computer for 15mins. told them i was gonna run to my car and they confirmed i'd be right back. then come back after not even two minutes. they had let a walk in go ahead of me and said sorry we have to take who is here when we're ready! really??    so rude! then told me i could wait another 30 mins for my sons haircut.
"got my haircut here in hopes to get rid of the dead ends and have overall healthy looking hair. i have very dry curly hair so moisturizer and a comb is needed in order to prevent breakage. you would think the stylist would be mindful since that is their profession. the women stared to brush my hair completely dry before my cut, i had to ask her to please at-least fully wet my hair thinking she would understand she's not only 1. hurting me 2. breaking my hair. she sprays my hair a few times barely making it dampand i proceed to ask for some sort of conditioning to proceed with the brushing. at this point she is not caring what so ever about being mindful of my hair. i tell her let's just wash it 4$ more but maybe with my hair fully wet she will be more gentle and not have to cause more damage. after the wash she continues to mistreat my hair. pulling at knots until they ripped! i was shocked she proceeded yanking the comb and brush throughout this process. what shocked me the most was she proceeded to cut my hair without fully combing it. i understand i have a lot of knotting and curls but that is no excuse for a half ass job. on top of everything my hair is severely shorter and not at all what i asked for. hiring stylist who are mindful of other people's needs and hair types should be top priory for hair cut salons. horrible experience ."
"our usual place closed with no warning, so we needed a new place.  this is where we ended up ... thanks to yelp.  our new stylist is zachary and he did a fabulous job for my mom and me!"
"briana cut my hair yesterday at about 2:00 pm.  there was nobody else waiting at that time.she is cute, she is experienced and she has excellent personality(also her first day at this location.)have been getting my hair cut here for about 3 years, simply out of convenience, have never had a particularly bad cut(i get buzzed with a #2 guard), but there is not a lot of art to that.briana had excellent conversation skills, and she got my hair cut with a little extra flair(great job on the sideburns) and had me finished professionally with a minimal amount of fuss.if she doesn't continue working at this location i'm going to be extremely bummed out.  she made the experience of getting my hair cut actually fun."
check in online. download the app so you can lower your wait time. makes it so much easier.
i took my two kids to get their haircut today as a walk in and the stylist are very friendly to both my kids. there is no one there when we walk in so there is no wait time. very great service
"got my hair styled today for an event, the worst job ever. what a waste of money and time.very disappointing !!!"
great haircut as usual. easy to check in and in and out in 15 minutes. keep up the good work.
i went in to get a haircut today and the asian lady cutting my hair didn't even get close to what i was wanting then she charged me more for styling it. i don't recommend this place to anyone.
"(fyi - i posted this same review about the evergreen square site, since i visit both of them,, depending on which has the shorter wait time.)what's in a haircut?i never thought much about it until my perspective changed. i had a diving accident in 2014. i'm paralyzed below my chest with no functional use of my arms or hands. so appearances above the chest are more important to me now - you gotta make use of what you have. that means goofy hair is no longer acceptable for me.sadly, it happens when my hair gets too long on the side of my head, because that's where the controls for my wheelchair lie. so i like my hair a bit shorter on the side of my head. i tell the hairstylist what i want, and i get what i ask for. you're gonna like that.i like that they save my haircut online so if i go to a different location i come out looking the same. make sure to use the online check-in to save time! you're gonna like that too.for any wheelchair users, the sites at evergreen square and tully road are approved by me - i have a huge electric chair. the ladies are happy to move their barber seats out of the way and i plug right in.consistency, flexibility, wheelchair compatibility, and all the latest tech. there's a lot i like."
let's start off by saying if i could give zero stars i would. my boyfriend just got home - typically cut his hair myself. 3 all around and clean up the edges. but its insanely hot so thought he could just go somewhere this once. let's just say he will not be returning thanks to itzel. he waited almost 45 mins and then came home with a haircut i'm positive our cat could have done better. uneven and patches of hair everywhere. ridiculous.
"usually when i come here i always try to get denise but it's so hard to find her sometimes and i'm not sure if she still works their but she was amazing, today i went in and saw a new face his name was ben. if you come here and have the pleasure of meeting ben i suggest you wait for him! super nice and really cared about his job. don't forget to to him ! ;) thx ben"
"i just got my haircut here today and the lady who cut my hair did a fabulous job!  this was my second visit and both times i have left happy.  i will say though that this location does not follow the great clips standards... while i was disappointed about that it won't stop me from going back.  the end result is what really matters and i got a great haircut.  and in case if you're wondering how i know they are not following the standards i use to manage great clips salons for 7 years before i decided to leave the hair industry.  yes i still have a current license,  but it's only for friends and family now."
"inconsistent cuts most the time. i sat there for at least 30 minutes getting a very basic haircut (clipper cut /fade). the worker kept going over the same area with the clippers and i was starting to get a headache and somewhat irritated. the youthful looking staff members are unprofessional (well at least one is, consistently, every time i go there.) the manager and some of the older staff members a never/rarely mess up my hair. i didn't complain because i just wanted to get out and go home (after a pretty tiring day at work, this was the least of my expectations).judging by the lack of responses to negative posts on yelp, this reflects the quality of their business. i've gone here on and off for many years.... they have such a high turn over when it comes to keeping barbers. going to kim hair and nail, for 7 bucks is a way better deal than what they charge here, but i got lazy and went here.my hair style is pretty damn simple.... if anyone reading this can do a regular buzz cut/ clipper fade let me know! lol"
this location has been terrible the second time my husband went too. he asked marylou the stylist to shave his head bald but instead she left pouches of hair on his head.  a terrible job but before she shaved it he ask to wash his hair. she ask if he can transfer from his wheelchair which he said no then she said no we can't wash your hair. the first time he went they were able to wash his hair while he was in his wheelchair.  called this shop twice to complain and yet again they didn't do anything. this is the last time he comes here.
i came here last saturday morning right when they opened. i asked for a zero on the sides and a medium to high fade.i believe the person that serviced me was denise.anyways her razor cut my neck and now i have dry scabs from where the blood clotted.never coming back here again.
friendly staff... came in for a trim and the styles was very kind and fast... they keep your hair cut records.. which kinda caught me off guard lol... but seems in handy for next time..
"if yelp had a minus star ratings, this place earned it. they  cut my hair unevenly, so when i went back to bring this to their attention, i waited to  speak to the girl that cut my hair, then all of a sudden two other hair trimmers weighed in on their ideas;  they wanted to cut even more off, but that would have left me bald; then said do i comb over my hair? their next remedy was to let it grow out! then one trimmer said, ""i was being a"", and then spoke under her breath. that was not exactly how i thought they would handle the issue. so they said leave my number and we will call you back, i was upset with having to argue with employees who have no protocol to deal with issues with their customers. the employees have varying abilities cutting hair and you have to be careful who you get. customer service is terrible. there friendly until you have an problem. then the aprons come off. until they get there employees on the same page, i would go elsewhere.3/18/17 changed my review. their a-ok.p.s. the next mourning i received a message from the owner and a call from the manager, and they pretty much bent over backwards to make it right, which made me feel like doing cartwheels! thank you!"
first timer at great clips. needed my hair trimmed. issy cut &styled my hair as good as i've ever had. no reason to pay$$$ ever again. i highly recommend issy as ur new stylist
"i don't usually go out to get my hair cut, but i was in need of a trim and had a coupon for $2 off at great clips, so i thought i might as well give it a try. upon arrival i was greeted by the employees and immediately seated. my hair stylist, nancy, was extremely friendly and went right to it. i didn't need much but about an inch and a half off around, as well as an inch off my bangs. nancy was also very good about starting off subtly to make sure not too much was cut off; she made sure to cut off all the frayed ends while keeping my hair at a good length to continue growing out.the session was short, but nancy was such a friendly and accommodating individual that i'm definitely willing to come back for all my hair cutting needs!"
on saturdays it's not so bad but i made the mistake of coming on a friday night at 7:30. not busy but there's two stylist just cleaning up while the other is with a client. no checking in on me or letting me know why they haven't tended to me. probably never coming back. the people on saturdays are a lot more courteous so i recommend coming going that day.
"this is the worst place you can go to get a hair cut, hands down. my hair was butchered here. asked for a fade halfway up, the lady even pointed out how high she was going to go and continued to go way to high, and didn't even blend the sides."
i spontaneously went in today to get my hair trimmed and i am more than satisfied with their services. katelyn was super friendly! she did exactly what i asked for when she cut my hairs and she did a wonderful job! my hair feels amazingly soft and healthy. definitely will be coming back here.
"walked in and had a simple wash, style and blow dry done to my hair. nancy was wonderful. did a good job, gave me advice, refered me to a place in willow glenn that specialized in hair loss, did a great job on my hair looking at every detail. i will definitely return in the future."
was looking for a trim and some more layers added. let's just said they need to get some more education...
"i was a little hesitant to come here, but i needed a quick trim since i'm pressed for time. the first time i came here was when they first opened. i had a guy and while the cut was nice he butchered my bangs. they were supposed to be side bangs however he cut them as straight short bangs just pushed to the side. i had to have my uncle fix it once we got home, which is why i was very hesitant about coming here again.i got denise as my hair stylist. she was amazing! she gave me some information about the quality of my hair and how i can make it healthier. she was also very relaxed and humored by my lack of hair knowledge. she didn't get impatient by me not being able to decide. rather she helped me make a decision. overall, denise has changed my opinion about this place. i loved her and i would love getting my hair cut by here whenever i'm up north."
"this is my go-to salon.  super new and fresh. i consistently get a great haircut and have a good time, too.  staff here is nice and the facility is very clean.  added bonus is i can reward myself with ice cream, panda, or in n out after my cut.i i've never had a bad cut here, they seem to be staffed well, are clean, and they have people who actually can speak english.  recommend that you give them a try and see for yourself."
omg you'd think that after cutting soooo many people's hair they'd be able to at least give a decent fade... they can't. they ruined my brothers and sons hair at the same time. after they asked for so much info name. address. age. surprised they didn't ask for a social security number. don't do it people. it's not worth the few weeks of having a horrible haircut. for $16!!!
"haven't had madison's hair trimmed in awhile. it took a lot of coaxing but i finally got her in here.... first things first, very clean location. has a very new feel to it still. the lady that trimmed her hair made maddie feel extremely comfortable."
"i have very long hair and went in for a quick trim as i had not been able to get into the salon. they were helpful, fast and did a good job for basic trim, especially for 18 bucks. the lady also tapered my face layers and feathered the bottom so it was not a super harsh cut, she did great. would go back."
"i can't give feedback on their hair cutting because we did not even get that far. the woman at the front (also a stylist) was so dismissive and rude when we entered my 9 year old daughter (who needed the haircut) was appalled at how she treated us. after waiting 20 mim for her to finish and my daughter hopped in the chair and this woman began telling us how bad her hair was and that the cut we wanted would look terrible on her. my daughter was again shocked and we ended up leaving without a haircut because it was so rude, abrasive and offputting. i have never felt like i was unwelcome in a business before. we did end up across the street at another salon where none of that wad an issue and my daughter got exactly the haircut we wanted and it looked fabulous"
"very long overdue review.  i've been coming here for almost 20 years, since they first opened.  for the most part, the staff has stayed fairly constant for years, so there is a lot of experience cutting hair here.  i always see caroline who is consistent and tremendous at her job.  she has a lot of long term clients.even though i've moved further away, i still make the time to come back and see her.the store itself is clean and well organized.    various products in store to buy also.they have an online app system so you can check in before you get there, which is very convenient.  those complaining about walk ins going first must be confused about this.  prices have gone up over the years, but so have everything else, so people need to get over that.this isn't a high end salon, but if you are looking for a quality cut without the frills or hassle, go here, you'll be happy."
"worst great clips in the bay area. great franchise with many talented people that work at other locations (foster city) but this place is horrible. rude, tired, and incapable manager of doing her job. i wanted a shorter haircut in which the manager said she can't because she was going to cut her hands. i don't recommend you go here; please do a little more research and find an alternative. i am the type to get a haircut every two weeks and i expect a good haircut; if you consider yourself someone like me....don't go here."
"what a horrible experience!this place spends no time or effort spent on doing a good job ... just use electric clippers all over your scalp and finish up in a couple of min, and for that they charge $18! what a rip off and a terrible feeling about having your hair ruined! no point taking to the staff as they don't seem to be aware of what a good hair cut is!"
very clean they took us right in on a saturday it's close to restaurants grocery store kind of a on stop shop they were professional and fast i don't know what else you can ask for
"looks great, but skill set to cut kids hair is missing. spoiled my 5 year old by cutting his hair in irregular line. i pointed to the stylist and she insisted what she did was right :(it will grow back, so not worried much. poor kid doesn't know any better :)"
fast and can't beat the cost. i often am in here for my kiddo and we always have him see twee. she does a great job and the price is incredibly affordable.
"drop in for my fiancé who just needed his hair buzzed off (he rocks the bald look). he barely has any hair, just the captain picard ring. price $17 is too high for this service. glad they took us in quickly though. not a very good job with shaving him for the price either - we get a cheaper, better quality cut at luxury cut hair & nail further up saratoga in the lion market. we won't go to great clips again but we were strapped for time this time, as we were trying to catch a movie and hoped that gc could match for quality at worst. oh well."
"absolute worst place to go for a haircut. there is no style when you get a haircut. they just cut your hair off, which is something you can do at home with a razor. if i could find something below one star i would have given this place a -5 star.never go here unless you are desperate to waste your money."
"i took my kid for a haircut. there is this old lady who is impatient to listen. when the haircut was not done well, i asked her to make few adjustments, she is so rude and was hurting my kid intentionally with the hair clipper. i had to warn her to be careful with the clipper. i would stay away from this location."
"this place is good.  i used to be a regular here when i lived a lot closer to the area.  i really enjoy how great clips keep your hair cut information in the system, so then you don't have to mention to the employees what type of cut you want.  seems like this place is great for people of all ages.  the reason for just 3 stars is the price.  it'll cost you 15 to 16 dollars for a men's haircut.  now some folks might think that's already pretty reasonable, but i guess since my hair is pretty easy to cut, for me i usually go to places that will charge 10 to 12 dollars and still maintain a quality cut.  regarding price again, this place does accept competitor coupons, so make sure to check online or in the mail to see if you could find a coupon before coming here.  the ladies there do a great job so its worth checking out next time you want a hair cut."
"can i give a no star rating? they are completely clueless here.  i dropped in, just like everyone else.  i wanted to get a haircut for my 83 year old mother. i asked them how long the wait would be and they told me 15 minutes.  i told them i was going to get gas and that i would be back in 15 minutes.  i asked them if they needed my name and they said no. i went to get gas and came back before 15 minutes.  i brought my mother in and waited another 15 minutes for one of them to finish with their clients.  they both finished around the same time then took other walk-in clients!  when i approach her about it, she just looked at me like she saw a ghost.  she mumbled something about not having an appointment.  i said i made an appointment a half hour ago!  they should have told me i had to stay there, otherwise i would be giving up my appointment.  i don't know how good they are at cutting hair, but their customer service stinks."
"awful... i guess they don't care about their reviews because nothing's changed since the first time we went. my son has fairly easy hair to cut & they never get it like he wants it. language barriers also prevent any meaningful communication. it's a hair cutting mill, only there to burn through as many people in a day as possible. sports clips from now on. maybe they'll put this horrible place out of business."
"i love great clips, because they store your information, then access it before each cut. they know generally what i want in terms of clip length, then focus down on the details before cutting.they also have great products they recommend, which might seem like a sales pitch to some but a blessing to others. through this store i found nioxin, which thickens hair. the shampoo is quite expensive (i got redken instead, which is not as good but you get a much bigger bottle), but the nioxin hair gel is affordable and really does help.there is one lady who cuts my hair extremely well and gives a great head massage when you get shampooed. i don't want to give out her name or the days she works because i don't want to bombard her with requests, but if you send me a message i'll tell you. i don't know her full capabilities, but she does an asian fade very well."
this is second time i went... first time i went they did satisfactory...but this time when i went some guy did my hair cut within 5 mnt and totally screwed it. so my conclusion is that its very unstable and hair is on your risk since every time different person will cut..... now i have to wait to 1 month to get it rectify..i would not suggest any more thats all...... if you really interested great clips try sunnyvale great clips.. some how they did better job.... but this and santa clara great clips have horrible experience.
below par even for soulless hair salon chains.  been there a few times and had in indifferent to rude service every time. not going there again.
"i've been going here for years and i always go to thuy because she is familiar with my weirdo noggin and how to cut my hair so it actually looks good!everyone there is pretty friendly, the prices aren't bad (i will never pay $40 for a men's hair cut) and i rarely have to wait more than 10-15 minutes."
this place gives a great hair cut but won't extend wifi access while you wait. it would be a great idea if they would consider this for their busy customers.
i have a frequent customer card  that i wanted to redeem. they said that my hair cut voucher was not valid to use because it was styled cut and not a regular haircut .  the voucher did not have any restrictions or limitation.  i had paid for 12 haircuts to get the 1 free hair voucher and was told to pay for the $9 difference .  it seems like a  questionable promotion. i had planned on tipping  $5 but changed my mind and only tipped $3 .
"i've been going here for about 2 years just about and every time i go i am greeting with warm smiles and feel at home.anh seems to be the lucky gal that gets me the most. she is so sweet and loves to chit chat which makes getting my haircut more enjoyable. i have had several people cut my hair there, and i do not have any complaints!!! you all are wonderful!!!"
this place selectively honors app check-ins. today it was a 0 minute wait yet i waited 20 minutes before another guy who didn't check in was taken before me. and then a guy who did check in was taken in front of me. i deleted the app never to return
this place seriously chomped my hair. came by because the place i usually go to was closed...should have just waited a few days. all i wanted was a 1 on the sides and a small trim. what i got was a jacked up hairline and stray hairs everywhere. just stay away.
terrible. i went today for the first time in a while and i paid $28 for a hair & beard cut - the lady couldn't even line up my beard. seriously?! 28 dollars. i do not recommend.
"well i asked for below the earsee pic...there was no wait which was a plus... and my daughter enjoyed her hair cut and her little lollipop. the lady did great with herthe gentleman i had... i should have realized before i looked it was going to be bad as i could hear him mumbling... not even, still not even.... crap"
"worst hack job ever!do not let ky touch your hair unless you want it butchered. not sure if she has ever cut hair before or under the influence of substances, but she was horrible! never going back here. ever."
fast and easy way to get a quick trim. the online appointment lets you miss the crowds.
"avoid thu.told him low fade, he didn't see he was using a zero and faded high instead.turned the low fade to a high fade and cut all these different angles into my head!hell no!"
"best place for a kid's hair cut!i walked in with my 2 yr old toddler, who badly needed a hair cut. i was dreading the moment till lyndsay greeted us with a smile and made us feel she is in charge of the situation and it will be just a cake walk. sure it was! compared to the earlier experiences, my son was super cool, cried less while lyndsay did her magic with her clipper on my son's hair. she was super quick and knew exactly what to do. the hair cut was done in minutes! she is very good with kids. so if you have to get your toddler's hair cut, ask for lyndsay. plus there was no wait, so it was a huge plus for me!!"
"oh boy... so i got some coupons in the mail and since i wanted an easy yet specific cut, i thought i would try this place out, it helps that they are close to my house. i was greeted by the owner (maybe, he was in charge) and was told 15 minutes. it's was about that so, so far so good. i met kim who told me this was her first day there but that she worked at another salon previously. it all went downhill from here. i told her that i wanted her to take the longest attachment for the clippers that she had, and make all my hair one length. easy yet specific. no thinning shears, leave the sideburns alone, and clean up the neck. part way through, she starts to change the attachment. i stopped her and said all one length. then she takes out the thinning shears, so i tell her no and ask her not to use them. she starts talking about blending and fading and again i say, all one length. so she starts halfassing the rest of the cut and then says she's done. i pay with no tip, because you shouldn't ever have to tell someone cutting your hair the same thing that many times. when i get outside and look closely i see that the sides aren't even the same length, never mind the top being the same as the sides. so i go back in and tell the owner/ manager that it needs to be fixed. at least he did what i requested. since hair can't be added back, all my hair is now about 1/4 of an inch long.they were so bad they are no longer in business."
"no stars if possiblei've had a bad haircut in the past. but i've never been anywhere that allowed someone with no experience cutting hair to attempt on the job training with one of their best customers. i've been going to the location above for some time. and before that, went to the location in downtown san jose. i drive several miles to the above store because they have done a good job in the past. but this last experience was very disrespectful to me. the store manager allison has apparently hired a family member or friend (which is admirable); but with zero experience actually cutting hair. i've wasted my time and gas for someone to try and learn to cut hair on a paying customer. i now have to waste more time and gas to get a capable person to fix the screw up caused by your franchise manager's poor judgement! this obviously won't affect your bottom line as these are franchises. but i will not be returning to any great clips. bad reviews hurt all of your stores. and a great clips sign on the door is what the potential customer sees. very very bad experience for what should have been a simple hair cut. 10 minutes tops for the total job. and i always give a good tip. again; very disrespectful for a long time customer!"
extremely impolite. very bad customer service. checked in online - wait time kept going up from 15 min to 32min although i was there waiting!!! not worth it - take your business somewhere else.
"just had the worst haircut ever by stephanie carter! she did not take a single care when cutting my hair my lines in the back are all crooked, she didn't trim my neck, there was a line all the way around my head where she tried to do a fade, and she did not even comb my hair when she was done. i should get my hair fixed and all my money back. be careful."
"2 is generous, but i require a special cut., my wife is still satisfied with them so i can at least give them 2 stars.  after being turned away from 3 salons for a flat top due to skill and complexity requirements, the place who agreed and assured me they know what they were doing was great clips.   usually i reserve the flat top from the barber in mountain view. . ..  far, far to complex a cut for generic salon folk.  i knew in my gut i was making a mistake, but was i trapped with no barber open for a quick fix,i had recently grown my hair out from a 0 shave and was ready for the first flat top in 6 months. perhaps my standards were too high after getting the ""oh so darn flat"" cut from my barber.   the flat top that made people stop and say ""wow thats the flatest i have ever seen ever""what i received from great clips was just right of gumby's hair style.  great slant to one side and really fuzzy on the left6 if you like that kind of thing.   i was regalled with the story of how she watched a lad cut a flat top and did 3 others on kids making her expert.  all of course after the damage was done. fortunately hair grows back, and it was only 15 bucks plus tip.   my barber charges  $9 which i gladly drop $20 for his expertise.lesson: there is a reason barbers still exisit.  plan accordingly or suffer the wrath of the cheap salon.  good news is if i ever need a gumby left cut, they have it in there computer for future reference."
"i have now been to this location twice. both times i had to sit and argue with them about how i wanted my haircut. even though i have had the same cut many times before from different places, they wanted to convince me that the cut would not work. while i do realize this is their job, i'm pretty sure i have lived with my same hair for over 25 years and know better than anyone what it will and will not do. they need to listen to their customers wants rather than telling them what they need. i will not make the same mistake again and will be looking for a professional barber at this point."
"this review  for my son hair cut. even though his hair type is easy to cut and we asked very simple hair style, he could not do it properly. i think great clips quality is declining these days and i don't know why!"
"mina the hair stylist did a good job with the haircut.however, i do not like this franchise location. they  charge the highest for hair cuts $16. they do not honor the great clip $11.99 hair cut promotion. you buy $11.99 hair cuts in advance and load them onto the gift card. i bought 5 from this location 6 months ago. the cashier refused to even look on his cashier/computer to see if they could do this.  would never come to again because of poor customer service."
"i've been meaning to write a review but haven't had the time. anyway, my story happened a couple months ago when i came in for a haircut. i asked for the asian guy david.  he seemed like a cool guy who cut hair well. but truthfulness was the real problem. as i was paying to leave, i gave david a 20 dollar bill for my 16 dollar cut. not realizing how much change he gave me back, i proceeded to walk out. i was in my car and finally realized david had stole 3 dollars from me because he only gave me a dollar back in change. maybe he thought i wasn't going to tip him? but still, you don't fucking do that kind of stuff. i was about to walk in and call him out, yet there were kids inside so i didnt want to make a huge scene. long story short, i payed, and he didn't give me my full amount of change back because he was trying to sneak a little extra for himself."
"they served someone who walked in after me first. while she was shampooing my hair, she wasn't paying attention and was basically shampooing my eyebrows. after shampooing my hair into knots, she proceeded to rip them out with a comb. after telling her what style cut i wanted, she began to cut my hair and then informed that that was not the right style for me. she spent the entire time telling me everything wrong with my hairstyle and color. she even told me that i had to cut my hair like hers to look good. i will not be going back here. i would not recommend this place."
"absolutely the worst hair cut ive ever had! if u go there make sure one of the asian ladies cut your hair! im white and not racist but the last two times i was there an older white lady then today a young white lady messed up doing a 1 to 3 fade! lol every time one of the asian ladies cut my hair it came out right! absolute waste of money! i truly told her theres nothing else she could do for me, paid my bill and booked it before she messed it up more than she already did!"
quick visit no waiting and reasonable priced hair cut with sylvia ! thanks will be back !
"amateur stylists, can't do a good job on both kids and adults, ruined mine and daughters hair style. stay away!"
"i dislike giving negative reviews but this had to be said. had my boyfriend take our son here for a hair cut. it was his second time with rasario, first time was a decent cut although at that time she refused to fix uneven areas that i pointed out stating ""it's just like that"". my son didn't want to get back into the chair anyways because she kept squeezing my son's cheeks together while cutting his hair. i was already irritated with her so i stated my frustration and let it go.  second time, my boyfriend thought he'd give it another shot, hoped to get another stylist but got rasario again. she managed to carve one large bald spots in the back of my son's head & a crooked fade on both sides. mind you, my son stays still for his hair cuts. my boyfriend said he asked her to fix it but she refused again & so he left with son thinking it probably wasn't a good idea to have her ""fix"" the mistakes because my son would probably end up bald. the minute i got home and saw my son, i could see the unevenness, where she did not actually fade instead just cut straight through with no blending. it looked horrible. i was so upset. i called and the guy who answered was nice enough to say sorry and that they'd fix it. horrible customer service from rosario, even more horrible hair cut. thankfully the younger asian lady fixed rosario's mistakes but still, why did this even happen in the first place? ugh. so frustrating."
"it was friday 9/21 around 1030am. when i walked in, there was no customer, only two barbers there (a lady and a guy, both asian). as soon as i signed in, people were start coming in. she took me and basically made up her mind what was good for me. hair was not cut even, and i was done in less than 5 minutes. even though i received two $9.99 any haircut coupon, will not go there again."
"been here four times. first few visits went well. the stylist was able to get the work done really fast with acceptable quality.the last visit today was horrible. the stylist was not adequately trained,  probably only a trainee, reckless and impatient. she keeps waving the knives and scissors in front of my eyes within a close distance and got my neck hurt when trimming. when finished i asked for a mirror to see the back side, she quickly realized the work was not properly done and continue refining it. definitely not worth $18. better spend a few more to find a better place."
"usually i come here right after i go to the gym about once every two weeks.  every time you go there's different people every time and its hard to get a consistent person.  i don't really mind as long as they know what they are doing and my hair looks decent enough.  however, today was so bad that i feel the convenience of this shop no longer worth it.  usually my hair is longer and if they mess up a little bit i can style it in a way to look ok.  but todays cut was so bad that there was no possible product that can save it.  i literally went to my car, looked in the mirror and screamed. never been so mad about a haircut before. good luck to whoever decides to get their haircut here. its like flipping a coin"
"great price, great jobs, great service.this is the first time i come to this place for my haircut, i will come back and this is will be my favorite shop for now on , i love the way they take care my hair and shampoo,the shop looks very nice and clean, music soft and nice , very friendly and special the service is the best , 5 start definitely giving to this shop , believe me, just come try one time it can say all .1085 e brokaw road san jose ca 95131 ."
"i am usually hesitant about coming to places such as great clips solely because i've had bad experiences years ago. a few days ago, i thought i'd give it a shot because i was starting school again, and didn't have time to make an appointment at a salon. i walked in and was greeted right away, jennie led me to my seat where i told her what i wanted. i wanted only my dead ends cut, didn't want my hair to go short since i'm trying to grow it longer. and then i told her i wanted layers. okay. layers are supposed to flow evenly with your hair. that didn't happen. i also asked for my hair to be whisky around my face, but didn't allow it to flow evenly with the rest of my hair. kind of like ""here's the wisp, and just goes straight into my regular length. definitely doesn't blend well at all. jennie told me she was only cutting 1 inch for dead ends. she ended cutting about 2/3 inches:( in terms of my layers. they are really bad. never had layers like this... my layers came out more of a straight line!:( it looks really bad. i tried telling her, and she said ""no, it's supposed to look like that."" i didn't want to cause a scene, so i paid $18 and left. i recommend going to an upscale salon if you want your hair cut. she even left one strand of my long hair, which wasn't cut. she's a sweet lady, but doesn't know how to style. really upset. thankfully i made an appointment at elysian hair salon to fix what great clips messed up."
"i had a haircut here yesterday with an old asian lady. since my hair was below my waistline, i specifically asked ""to cut 6-7 inches for my hair to be at my chest-level"" and showed her exactly how long.after the cut, my hair is barely touching my shoulders... it's at least 3-4 inches shorter than what i asked for. would not recommend the old lady working here. she became extremely defensive when i told her this was much shorter than what i asked for, and she tried to blame me for misguiding her?!?it was my first time trying great clips and will be my last. never coming back here again..."
the owner offer my dad to go back again for a hair cut. he was happy with the service this time. they listen to him and make sure the length he wants before they started.
owner was extremely sincere in remedying the situation and was kind to offer a free haircut and a refund. i believe he has address the situation and is very sincere about serving the customers.
great place and great price .one of the best haircuts i ever received in the bay area ...
"clean, super fast, very friendly. i got a coupon as new resident in the hood so i wanted to take advantage of trimming my hair without spending too much. so that is a perfect approach. for less than $8 i left the salon feeling the queen of mambo! very clean, there was a guy removing the hair of customers from the floor all the time."
"been here quite a few times, recommend tc and rasario as stylists. first cut today with rasario and she did great, one of the best cuts i've had in awhile. check in online to avoid longer waits upon arriving."
"listen, if you're like me, time is important and on that champagne taste with a kombucha budget then i can't say enough about this place and this location. first off, it's so easy to schedule an appointment. i did it through yelp and they have an app. boom, you know what to expect in terms of waiting time. second, i used to see angel but she no longer is there and i came in today serendipitously and john took me. we chatted for a few minutes about what i was looking to achieve hair style wise and he worked with it.  i closed my eyes, meditated for what seemed like 10 mins and bam  a new beautiful hairstyle appeared! seriously blown away by his listening skills and artistry. he's a professional for sure. highly recommend him and this location. oh and to boot, place is clean, fun music, and clean bathroom. coming back in a few months!"
ms. vicky is a great hair stylist. she take her time with my 10 years old daughter and my hair cut. she is knowledgeable stylist here. this is the third time we came back to this place. great customer service from front desk check in. ms. linda is very nice stylist. she is gentle with my 5 yrs old.
my 9 year old gets his hair cut here almost monthly. they have great deals and always sending coupons. he only wants amar he is very patient and listens to exactly what my son wants. my son refuses to let anyone else touch his hair. he always asks my son how he is doing. my son has sensory issues so is sensitive and amar understands. i too have had my hair cut and i had an older asian man and he was great and super fast.
i got haircut by sima. it is the worst haircut i received in bay area. she does not even listen to me what i am asking for and she left all of a sudden when i am asking about some changes and complained the main guy. worst service and you dont get what you ask for. all you will get is what they cut (i still tipped 25%)don't go for haircut over here
"natalie was so sweet and gave me a great haircut! i showed her a picture because i wanted of long layers  and she gave me exactly what i wanted, thanks girl!"
"i was skeptical the first time i came here because i consider this a ""discount"" place.however, go see linda or tatiana.  both excellent stylist who always give me a great cut and both are worth waiting for.just because this is a ""discount"" type of place do not forget to tip the gals well.  they are worth every dollar!!"
"i had been coming here for many years, and always received an excellent cut.  areli, who has since left, always did an exceptional job.  the others who i found exceptional include evonne, anne, and timmy.  the atmosphere has always been welcoming and relaxing.  i can sometimes get busy, but i found that non-peak times, especially the morning, worked best.  of all the great clips shops i have been to throughout the bay area, this one was the best."
"i usually frequent great clips for a trim in  between salon appointments. this last visit left me with short layers cut in back,  which i did not request. i told the stylist  that there was one short layer that i was trying to grow out. i was disappointed to have  choppy layes in the back of my head . please listen to your customers."
"decided to come here instead of the usual location in sunnyvale.  the experience was ok.  it looks like the sunnyvale location is not correctly connected to the great clips network.  the stylist could not find any notes from the sunnyvale location regarding how my hair is normally cut, etc.several different stylists at the sunnyvale location have done my hair and i've been happy with each and every one of them.  i was not really ""feeling"" my haircut from this spot.  so, i will just stick to the sunnyvale spot."
just had a haircut for myself and my two sons. both jenny and mary did a great job!  highly recommended!
"this guys s my third visit here. very nice people working here. always respectful, accurate and professional. iris martinez is real professional. she did a great job. it is first time she cut my hairs. i like it! definitely five stars deserved! i will come back for sure!"
my boys gets their hair cut here. they love everyone that works here. great customer service and they do not rush you even if it's the not so little ones who are getting them. it can really gets super busy on weekends so check in ahead of time on line.
excellent customer service and professional. araseli cut my hair and washed my hair. she knows how to cut and style your hair. thank you for my new style!!!
very poor customer service. checked in online and it said wait is 0 mins. walked in a bit later and had to wait while they took other customers rather than by the order of online check-in.
had a decent haircut as i asked the person to cut of size 2 for side but he didnot have proper equipment and did a haircut just by approximation. cut was ok but not what was required.
"my only issue with this place is the employees coming in late which causes a big backlog. the store opens at 9am and there is only 1-2 stylists on site. then within the next 15-30 minutes the rest of the employees waltz in late. i'm fine waiting for a haircut if you are busy, i'm not fine waiting for employees to get their coffee on the way in and showing up late. i think the classic saying needs to be enforced here. if you're 15 minutes early, you're on time, if you're on time, you're late, and if you are late, don't bother showing up. operationally, this delays you all day long. this is now the 3rd time i've dealt with this issue at this location. in the time it took me to write this you have lost the business of 6 people that don't want to wait."
"the owner reached out to me after i left my review to apologize for kim. apparently she was a temp to step in for someone who was taking time off due to health reasons. after i requested a refund, she granted that and offered a free haircut to fix my disaster. unfortunately i was only home for the holidays so i could not take her up on the offer. i still stand by my advice to remember who has given you good haircuts and request them. if you don't remember either ask the manager for a recommendation or ask for your history or who you've had previously great clips still has a 4/5 from me with 0.5 stars taken off for kim (since she's not a regular) and rounded up since i can't give half stars"
"you get what you pay for. -.-there is a strong communication barrier with most of the barbers. regardless of what you try to ask for they're just going to stick to what they know. all in all if you want a cheap cut with a short wait this could be your place, but if you really care about your haircut (or need certain specifications for work or some other reason) this is not the place to go to."
"the good:+  cheap.+  online check-in so you can beat the line.the not so good:-  i asked for a zero fade and had to have the whole fade redone because it was cut using a one.  my guess is they don't like going straight to zero because its a little riskier if not done correctly.  i didn't like that i had to call it out and have them use a real zero.-  my fade came out a little uneven on one side, and you could see the definite transition lines looking at my fade from a side angle which was unsightly.  some of the competitors can get you a nice zero fade for about the same price.-  you need to be clear about the height of your fade and show them.  i asked for a medium to low fade, but the fade was taken almost all the way up, meaning instead of a proper tapered low fade i ended up looking like i had a faux-hawk.  bottom line:come here if you need to get trimmed up for cheap and quick.  don't expect any styling to be done, and don't expect the talent to have an emphasis on technique.  you will have to be very explicit with your directions to avoid any miscommunication."
this is the 2nd time to visit this great clips in palo alto. daniel did a very good job with my fade. he's also friendly and has such a good customer service. definitely recommend to this great clips.
signed in on line. i waited to go in until my turn was minutes away. when we walked in my app showed i was at 0 minutes. the women at the register looked at each other and informed us there were a couple of people ahead of us. it's now been almost 20 minutes and they have taken all kinds of people ahead if us. everyone that walked in when we did who had not signed in on line were told that it is a 15 minute wait. why do they bother with the app if it's the same wait? i would have come in sooner. feels like something unethical is going on here.
"incompetent and very poorly organized. i'm sitting waiting for my turn. then they had me wait while they take care of next costumer even though i had checked with them and supposed to be the next costumer. what a waste a time. what a place with incompetent staff. go there if you want a bad haircut by an incompetent staff whose main goal is to push for selling overpriced low quality shampoos.update: no that wasn't the case, i was told that i'm the next and i planned to be somewhere accordingly...  maybe your incompetent staff need a training to do more than just upselling shampoos and conditioners"
"have to sing areli's praises. i am new to the area and decided to try a cosmetology school for a bob haircut. i've had this haircut before and know how it is supposed to look and feel. unfortunately, the cosmetology school cut was a bust. the angle and overall shape of the cut was just wrong. panicking, i went to the nearest great clips in hopes that a stylist could fix the damage enough to tide me over until i could get a salon appointment. enter areli. she took me right to her chair and made sure to understand exactly what i disliked about my current cut. she took care of the shape and more. i left with the haircut that i was expecting and looking forward to. thank you, thank you, thank you!"
i've been going to this great clips for many years and they are fantastic. the staff is excellent. they handle many different styles of hair with great professionalism.
"i love evonne.  she is always so nice and does such a great job! even though it is a little far to drive, it's worth it to have her cut my hair.  she also cuts both my kids hair and they love her!"
"here's the thing about places like great clips, you can't go in expecting the best haircut of your life or coming out looking like a movie star. this place is meant for a fast and cheap haircut, which is essentially what i got. i'm the type of person who refuses to spend more than 20 bucks on a haircut, to the point that i've contemplated letting my hubby try cutting my hair for free. my philosophy for hair may not fit for others, but being that i have straight, slippery, jet black asian hair, i've never really been into excessive styling since it usually comes undone by the end of the day. that said, my experience at great clips was great thanks to a young chinese woman named lillian. she understood my preference for a low maintenance haircut, and actually listened to me when i told her how short i wanted it (unlike my last haircut where the stylist purposely left my hair longer than requested, in case i wanted a ""blow out""). she also threw in some layers and great conversation to boot. will definitely be back for my next haircut, especially if lillian is available. no appointment necessary- i walked in on a tuesday afternoon before school was out- and no wait."
"they do not take reservations on the phone, rather you check in online. i suppose it frees up their time to focus on cutting hair. the hair stylists here are a hit or miss. my go to hair stylist is a doll. she spends extra time with the hair style i want and you can tell she cares."
"been getting perfect hair cuts and shampoos from these folks since i was a child of nearly 5 years old , these men and women have watched me grow up. very beautiful and sweet women that work here, even at 20 minutes before closing they cut my hair perfectly. i've given them a hard time many times but they still treated me right , so close to my house to."
annoying system ....why would i give my phone number for a hair cut?????  told them so ...but they don't get it.
"what's in a haircut?i never thought much about it until my perspective changed. i had a diving accident in 2014. i'm paralyzed below my chest with no functional use of my arms or hands. so appearances above the chest are more important to me now - you gotta make use of what you have. that means goofy hair is no longer acceptable for me.sadly, it happens when my hair gets too long on the side of my head, because that's where the controls for my wheelchair lie. so i like my hair a bit shorter on the side of my head. i tell the hairstylist what i want, and i get what i ask for. you're gonna like that.i like that they save my haircut online so if i go to a different location i come out looking the same. make sure to use the online check-in to save time! you're gonna like that too.for any wheelchair users, the sites at evergreen square and tully road are approved by me - i have a huge electric chair. the ladies are happy to move their barber seats out of the way and i plug right in.consistency, flexibility, wheelchair compatibility, and all the latest tech. there's a lot i like."
"waited over a half an hour before i left. the online check-in is bs...they go before someone physically waiting. i sat through 3 people coming in and stating they had checked in online and got helped before me, then a woman who hadn't even checked in online was helped so i left... and will never be back. do not waste your time with these jerks."
i've been going here on and off for a couple of years now. the wait is short which is always a plus. its clean and comfortable. and today id like to thank lina for the cut and i will for sure be back more!
"checked in online for myself and two others. it was half an hour to closing and they looked very busy. the lady asked if we'd been there before and then asked for phone number after we were waiting for 10 minutes. she started counting money and the man said they can't take three people, nor two. they could have told us when we first got there that their online check in doesn't mean anything or better yet, not let people check in online after a certain time if they won't be served? so after reading the recent reviews, maybe it was a good thing that we didn't get service. not going back."
"hit or miss, totally depends on the stylist; no minimum guarantees.went there after a long time to try and had a very bad hair cut this morning."
"a week ago i have a 1 star rating after consecutive bad cuts. manager carmelita reached out and offered a free fix. scheduled it for a week later. a much better finish and overall experience. as previous stated there are good workers, just got to know who they are."
"got my haircut today and i actually hate it. i asked that my layers be in a v-cut. nope. didn't do that. i felt bad if i said that i hated it but i really wouldn't go here again. it turned out to be terrible. great location. terrible hair cut. i appreciate that the lady tried to keep me preoccupied by talking to me about her kids, etc. but it was just not good. i would've preferred to be cut by someone else. truly disappointed.3/6 edited. after a not-so-good haircut experience, i went back & i must say, she fixed me up really nice. my hair is thick and harder to manage but she was extremely professional and so kind even though i'm sure she may have hated my review. i explained that i shouldn't have been so negative about it however i did appreciate her sincerity and her willingness to fix the problem. would i come back? yes. definitely. thank you great clips for your dedication to excellent service!"
"i usually come here to get my hair cut, but the last time i went i had a specific way i wanted my hair cut. i even showed how much i wanted yet they gave me an ugly, short haircut that looked nothing like what i wanted. i dont have the same hair type as the cutters so i was mad that they did whatever they wanted. do not go on a day where it isnt busy because the people who are there arent good. go during a busy time so there are more people to choose from."
"1) wanted me full name, email, phone number and other personal info just to get on the list to wait for a haircut. seemed offended when i said i just wanted a haircut. 2) told me 35 minutes, i wandered around the farmers market and came back in 20 minutes, they said that i was late and they had been calling me (nothing on my phone)3) someone else had my phone number before i changed it and used great clips. the woman at the counter didn't believe that i wasn't sergio, no matter how many times i explained it. 4) haircut wasn't great. 5) there was a fly in the store, buzzing around my station, so the woman tried to use the blow dryer to blow it away. she ended up blowing a bunch of my hair from the cover in my face, twice; didn't bother apologizing."
"i have been doing to this location for 6 years but today's experience was terrible. i usually do not request specific stylist and today i was assigned to an absolute moron. he just grabbed my front hair which are thinning and cut them to the roots making me almost bald.also, another lady cut my son's hair like a someone chewed it.both new people and seemed without any experience! i have now decided to request a stylist which i know, i think it is highly important even if you have to wait.i give this place 1 star for hiring completely clueless people."
i just very much appreciate the owners tamara and her husband going out of the way to make a wrong situation right. they sent me a personal letter when i had a bad experience and gave a very good reason to their price changes recently. thank for you being understanding to me and my issue and being honest about the circumstances. much appreciate the gesture and personal care.
"it's really unfortunate when you have a business with a lack of customer service. what's worst is the business having a manager who is the prime example of inappropriate behavior and a lack of customer service. a few of the workers here speak their own language and are not courteous to how it affects the customers. to my surprised, i learned that it was the store manager ""lien"" that was bad mouthing other employees and making comments about customers (in vietnamese). please do not support a business that allows for this."
"this will be the last time i attend this place. for starters, you know it's going to be bad when you hear one of the cosmetologist complaining about when she will get to leave work and the other two workers are basically telling her to stop complaining. it gets even worse when the one that's complaining ends up cutting your hair. i don't know how she managed to pass her license exam but man was she horrible and i wish i could remember her name so i could mention it here. i always ask for the usual same as last time style which the great clips system is good at keeping track of, but she couldn't for the life of her figure out how to fade let alone make it even. she hesitated to show me the back of my head until i asked and when i saw it i was extremely disappointed. it looked like the rocky mountains jagged! had it not been so busy i would have asked for her to stop and let someone else cut my hair. like i said this will be the last $20 i pay for a bad style cut. bye bye not so great clips."
"9:04 am, saturday morning. i just called and they don't take appointments. the person said to walk in or check in on the great clips app. when i first logged into the app, the wait was 22 minutes. now 9:13 am, the wait is 13 minutes. so, if you wanted to get a hair cut at 10 am, you need to check in sometime before and hope you time your check in just right."
"checked in online where the est wait time was 35 min. was greeted immediately and finished checking in upon arrival - actual wait time was less than 15 min. lina was my assigned stylist. she asked how i wanted my hair cut and i showed her some pics of how it's normally cut by my nephew. she cut it as requested and the result was spot on. i couldn't be any happier with the cut! thank you great clips and lina for the great service - you now have a new, repeat customer!"
"i've been coming here for my haircuts since it is close by my house. i've been coming here for two years and majority of the time get my haircut from lien. i am always satisfied with the haircuts i get from her. she always listens to what i want in a haircut. it is understandable that some haircuts i show her cannot be done due to the type of hair i have, but she definitely gets close to it as possible. i would definitely recommend her."
"to be honest i've avoided coming here because for some reason i like to take chances on terrible vietnamese hair salons. since i was in the area, short on time, and in desperate need of a haircut, i decided to come in here. i was immediately greeted by a woman name karen. karen has got to be the most endearing hairstylist i've ever come across. she makes it a point to learn your name and say it at least 5 times throughout your haircut. she explains exactly what and why she's doing what she's doing. she actually reminded me to wash my hair after a haircut, i can't even be mad.as an athlete, my hair was pretty damaged due to all the chlorine and poor little pony tails it has endured! not to mention, my last haircut from some other salon left me with hair reminiscent of a 14 year old emo teeny bopper (thick on top, thin on bottom), needless to say, i hated it. karen fixed it right up erasing a weird rat tail like layer and rounding out the layers to the best of her ability. she wanted to cut a little more than what i was usually comfortable with, but she actually asked me & told me why! i like that she asked me first before she cut it because i know we all have horror stories where the stylist expressed a little too much creative freedom! long story short, my hair looks healthier and fuller without feeling heavy! glad i came in and can't wait to stop in for my next trim! :)"
"i've been going to this great clips or several years, never disappointed. the last couple cuts have been by theresa, she's fast and does a nice job. i'm not sure where the comments about rude staff come from, i've always been treated with the utmost courtesy."
"terrible. rude staff, didn't listen to my instructions.  the great clips down the street by the toys r us is great but this one is a little closer so thought i'd give it a try. big mistake, i'm a guy and not terribly picky about my hair but even i think this is awful.  tried to correct the woman doing the cut and she blew me off. to top it off she rudely demanded a tip. i laughed and left, thank god my hair grows fast."
helena looks experienced but did a really shabby job with my haircut. she finished cutting my hair within 5 minutes and was more interested in getting to the next customer. the other hairstylist took more time and seemed to have done a better job. i'd not advise this location.
this is run by a by rude people who dont know how to cut hair. please never go there with kids. they are unfriendly to kids and just dont care about customers.
"so bad! this is not my son's usual place to get his hair cut. i forced him to try this place because, 1) its great clips (pretty popular) 2) it was convenient at that very moment. after my son's hair cut, i noticed the lady didn't shave or clean the back of my son's neck to get rid of the access hair. his barber usually  does to compliment his new clean cut. i told the lady to please shave the ""baby hair"" and she sighed heavily as if i am asking her for a favor. she cleaned it but unwillingly. she charged me $17 (ridiculously expensive) i only pay $11 for his barber! i gave her a $1 - tip anyway because i'm nice like that but we are not going back unless i have the ""free haircut"" coupon which they give out sometimes at gsw games. but i will not come back to this location. i'll go to the sunnyvale location. they are more customer friendly and they pay attention to details."
"i was not happy with this place for one reason; that reason was waiting and when two of their regulars came in, they went first. i understand if they have an appointment, that can be announced, but i wasn't told. i waited for about 20 minutes and their first regular walked in, was greeted and sat right away. i thought maybe this man has an appointment, but then a second regular came in and he was sat in righty away. another man that brought his child for a haircut was also interrupted to attend the two regulars. after leaving the place, i saw a sign that says ""first come, first serve."" never coming back again."
"i had a great experience,   i went to another place to get a hair cut and they messed up my hair bad. i went here after and they did a great job fixing my hair and i actually received complements afterwards, amazing"
they are not professional and very arrogant. they should learn how to cut hair and deal with costumer
can i give a minus star? so i specifically told the girl i was growing my hair out after years of crew cuts. i just needed a little trim and cleanup in the back. i had a party to go to that night....and i went here cuz my regular place is pretty spendy even for a trim. you get what you pay for right?lets just say i walked in expecting to pay a fair price for a trim. i left with a free crew cut and a bad attitude...
"i usually spend about $90 getting my hair cut but recently i've been trying to save money where i can so i opted for a ""cheap"" haircut. i came in great clips a bit nervous, but my long hair was so fried and damaged it was time to chop it up. i told chau (i believe was his name) what i wanted and he delivered. only 15 minutes and $16 later, my hair looked great and feels so much better. it's shorter than i usually have it, but he did a great job preserving some length and adding volume with layers and he succeeded in getting rid of most of my fried ends. he couldn't get rid of all of it because then my hair would've been too short and he was very conscientious about preserving length like i wanted. definitely will be coming back here in a few months to get rid of rest of the damaged hair. thanks, great clips!"
never too busy and always fast.  their app wait estimates are actually accurate.  if you want a decent haircut fast these guys are far better than supercuts.
"been coming to this great clips for a few years now. each of the hair stylists working there have different levels of skills/repeatability/etc.  i come to get my hair cut every couple of months and it's a trouble free and quick experience.i only come here for one of the stylists, helena. she's friendly, experienced at cutting hair quickly and efficiently, and does a great job whenever i go. i did have one fairly negative experience a couple of years back when i stopped by for a hair cut when helena wasn't there and it was just horrible.  took forever and turned out pretty bad.if you come here for a hair cut, ask for helena. she does a great job and if you have a request, discuss with her to come to a common understanding of what you want done. she'll work with you. other notes:at times, it can get busy, and some of the stylists do get chatty. they don't have a dedicated person to handle the reception, so if all of the stylists are engaged with customers, it might take a few moments to get signed in. they have an app for checking in, so definitely use that if you are in a rush.while waiting for my daughter's hair to get cut, i've watched other children get their hair cut and there's definitely a lot of satisfied parent/child customers here.i've seen some customers come in asking for a hair treatment, were told politely that they didn't do that particular service on that day, and the customer leaves complaining bitterly about them not being professional. don't understand this, but if you ask for a service and are told it isn't available, then it isn't . arguing or complaining loudly just makes that person a bad customer, in my mind. :(anyways, i like coming here since i get my hair cut at a good price and it comes out the same way each time. happy customer.edit:i don't speak vietnamese, only english, and i get great customer service here."
great staff and boy do they know how to cut hair! from kids to adults they have it totally dialed in!wait was short and the place was clean and staff was informative and attentive! be back for sure as the quality of cut was just awesome.great location as well!
"this is place consistently cuts my hair and they do it well. i regularly go here with my my kids and they are good with children. you can even use the app and schedule an appointment ahead of time, but i never do. they are open late so that helps me fit a haircut in with my busy schedule."
"terrible service. at one point i had to come twice so that they fix the haircut, even then it wasn't fixed properly. the manager has zero customer service skills. even if you check in with the app, and arrive 10 mins before they close, they will start complaining, and say come tomorrow. even though the app clearly states that you just need to arrive before closing. this great clips has the worst customer service out of all great clips i've visited in multiple states."
"i have tried many hair cuts places in the same price range as this great clips on kiely road and el camino real. i can say with confidence this is the worst place i've been to.i tried this place twice, the 2nd time i was really hoping the first time's bad experience was just an isolated incidence. hey, every one (place) deserves a second chance, right?  boy, was i wrong for giving this place the benefit of the doubt. the second time, i had a different hair dresser. at the end of her short session, i found that my hair is significantly shorter on one side than the other. in addition, it is shapeless and ticking out like cactus' arms. i felt ashamed even walking outside.i nicely asked the hair dresser if she could fix it a bit and nicely pointed out the issues with the mirror. she told me that if i want to fix it, that is the price of having a second hair cut done. so she flatly refused to fix anything.i know hair styles can be subjective sometimes, and i was definitely not expecting anything fancy from a budget place like this. but to brutalize someone's hair like this, and refusing to fix it is really unprofessional. if you don't mind getting an uneven hair cut, and just want to be in and out like a sausage factory, then maybe you can afford to take the risk at this place for $15. but if you want to look half way presentable at work, avoid this place like a plague."
"i was in a hurry and on this end of town, so i ducked in. my haircut is simple enough that i wasn't concerned about it getting screwed up, really. it's that basic.they took me right in, the lady who cut my hair (40s, vietnamese, pleasant) was conversational without talking me ear off.efficient, inexpensive, and sweet. my basic haircut looked fine, and i was back on the road running my errands 15 minutes later. who could ask for anything more from a quickie haircut place?"
"frauds? 9.99 sale they say you can only get 5 max.. while great clips nationwide say you can get between 5-25 per person..these people are only looking to make money.,., wont even listen without interrupting.. u have t explain/talk to them like kids..their 9.99 fraud personal store policy pi$$ed me off.."
"this is my go-to place for haircuts. i'm a pretty shy guy, but all the hair cutters here are very nice, and allow me to try out my awkward social chit chat skills. i usually go here with my girlfriend and flirt with the hairdressers to make her jealous. she never gets jealous. for a long time i didn't know how to style my hair and it looked awful. then i went to this great clips after not having gone for 5 years or so. they had stored my haircut instructions from 5 years prior in their computer. using those ancient instructions to cut my hair gave me my identity back. thank you great clips. i am forever in your debt."
"i came here to get my son a haircut. i don't know if it was the language barrier, as the hair stylist demonstrated a very thick accent in her expression and didn't paraphrase what i requested, but i did not end with what i asked for. i specifically ask for my son's hair to be ""trimmed, very slightly, as he's trying to let the top hair grow for a style."" i went to sit down and read a magazine and 10 minutes later i am called to see my son with his hair trimmed down to a ""spike-with-gel"" style, and there go two months of styling and letting his hair grow. i tipped the hairstylist and i have compassion on the person. we all need jobs, but she should try harder to understand what is being asked for in english, and deliver on it. definitely never coming back to this place. advice for future users: make sure the stylist understands what you asked for. ask them to paraphrase."
"hami and genie are the best! they both pay excellent attention to detail and can give you any haircut you want. keep in mind great clips is a fast paced salon, but hami and genie will still give you a fabulous haircut and in a short amount of time! i definitely recommend checking in online to save yourself a spot in line because it is a very busy location. and most importantly... don't forget to tip!"
"very unprofessionalwhen i checked in online, it showed 0 min wait. when i reached the salon, there was only one person working and she was already busy. after 15 min wait, another person appeared from the back room to finally take me in.she was very unfriendly and did a terrible job with my haircut. my sideburns are of unequal length and not trimmed properly.i waned to check my hair properly before leaving but she pretty much hurried me out of the chair."
calling them rude and disrespectful wouldn't do justice to how the do things here. not sure if it was just the one lady at the desk or they are all like that.
"place continues to go downhill. the stylist took barely a few minutes to finish my hair cut, and kept on trying to force me to leave my chair, make her payment and be done with it, even when it was clear that i was unhappy with the cut."
people are so polite and professional. also they are fast and listen to what you will say. i will recomend guys to come here and get their haircuts.
"their online check-in is bogus. i checked-in online and my wait period was 40 mins at the time of check-in. i waited for 40 mins and then reached the saloon. but i was still made to wait for another 25 mins despite being already checked in. not a great start if you want to retain customers, great clips."
"check in means nothing. when i first checked in, it says estimated time is 28 mins. got there before that and my time was then estimated to 47 minutes. checked in at 4:20...it is now 5:22, about to call our name...over an hour later!"
"waste of time to go there. couple of times faced this issue. i checked in online, but when i reach there before my appointment time, they asked me to wait for 30-45 minutes. i asked online system was showing 5 minutes wait time. the response was online system does not give accurate wait times, it just reserves spot. this place staff people do not value your time, so please avoid at least this place."
it is good that they are open till 8 pm on sunday but they do not answer their phone at all and voicemail is full! also the barber is eating while doing the haircut which is very disturbing.
"phoung as always does a great job. i will come to him again. he is sincere, and great at his job and goes out of the way to understand what kind of haircut you need."
"checked in on-line on a busy saturday, arrived and got in front of the line. had a nice trim with mary. i love the on-line check in and recommend doing so, especially on a weekend. got in and out."
"came in for a taper. the asian lady cutting my hair didn't know what a taper is. i trimmed my beard at home and asked her to match my sideburn to my beard, and she could not blend them together. she did a terrible job. if you're a man looking for a fade, taper, line up, or beard to hair blend don't come here. they'll mess up your hair and leave you looking messed up for the next two weeks lol"
person used past haircut notes and did not see that my visit this time was very early. relying on systems is good but then they need to learn how to use it instead of just looking at previous visit. common sense missing as they took off almost all hair on head and funny looking 'hard to define' haircut. regret going there
"*** stay away from the stylist named marianne! ***i've been to this particular great clips a whole lot and it's been a generally positive experience. i now know that was only because i had gotten lucky with my stylists (phuong is my favorite -- knowledgeable and willing to work with you every time. the lady who moved here from seattle and just had a baby is fantastic too as is the man who is into gaming. all three of you make this gc great)today, however, i was not so lucky. i ended up with a mid-age lady named marianne. off the bat, she said she didn't know how to do a fade when she looked at the instructions the stylist put in last time. i looked at her flabbergasted for a moment, to which she responds ""i guess i can blend a 2 on the sides into whatever you do on the top. trust me i can do a few things to make it look exactly the same."" (spoiler - it doesn't look exactly the same as the high fade i requested...). unfortunately there were no other stylists available so i had to just go with it. finally, before beginning, she asks me what i want to do on the top. i say that i'd like to style it and asked her if she had any recommendations. she responds with ""let me just take half an inch off the top and then we can talk about it then""she finishes doing both of the above and cleans up the edges all around, then hands me a mirror and says ""how does the back look?"". looks fine to me. ""yeah, the back looks good, but --"" she cuts me off by taking off the cover and asking to meet her at the register. let's recap:i asked for: 1) high fade, 2) style recommendation on topinstead i got: 1) a 2 on the sides/back 2) a 0.5"" trim on top.at this point she's already trying to ring me up at the register. i'm wholly confused at what the heck just happened and ask her ""wait what about the style recommendation on top?"" and she claims she won't do anything because she thinks i don't need to, to which i reply ""... but i had asked for it..."". she gives me a scowl and said to come to talk to her about it at the register. so in my shock i foolishly get up and walk to the register. as i go up i also tell her about an area where my hair tends to grow fastest in an odd direction and i ask her to cut it for me. no luck since the cover is already off, i get just an ask for a payment option...and that's when she looks at the man sitting behind me that had just walked in as she finished my haircut and says ""sir, i'm so sorry. i'll be with you in just a moment!"" her shift in attitude towards me as soon as he walked in left me so confused. i wish i had said something then, but i instead just paid. there was nothing i could do here except be angry. for the first time in my life did not leave a tip.i so badly want to come back because every other stylist has been nothing but amazing. marianne, however, is making me question my perception of great clips."
"i came here to get a standard men's haircut, 7 top 5 sides. any self respecting barber shop should be able to do that without any issue. by the time my haircut was done i already noticed some issues, but they were acceptable. at this point i would've given the cut a 3/5. then i got home and had the opportunity to take a closer look. the neck cut wasn't straight at all, and the angle of the tapers at the back were unequal. avoid this place at all costs."
"i got my hair cut with a very kind korean lady by the name of ""sonnie""the wait was prompt. even without her blow-drying my hair, i absolutely loved how she styled my hair. when i came home and blow-dried myself, i loved my hair even more! i almost regret not tipping her enough. highly recommended. definitely going back!"
"i have difficulties making stylists understand that i don't want short hair on the side. seems that most of them know one thing, and they stick with that.not the case, here - finally i got the right cut at this gc from nikki.very nice service, friendly, fast and efficient.will return."
"both of my sons prefer this place. they do excellent work, plus there's an online mobile check-in app that tells us wait time. marianne is one of the stylists there that really knows what she's doing. but i also suspect everyone there is very experienced."
"note that this is not a $40++ salon and thus please expect a different kind of service than your usual salon. this salon is good if you want to have a quick trim and not a new stylish hairstyle. if you want a new hairstyle, i suggest you go to a more expensive salon. this is a no fuss hair salon. i was in and out under 20 minutes i think.i tried this today the first time and i think this is one of the best hair salon of its kind. i got a quick trim of blunt cut. i usually don't have time to spare to pay a lot of attention to my hair, so i decided to get a no fuss hairstyle insteadwhen i came in, there was no queue, so i got called immediately. the older lady at the desk is friendly and is quick to serve me. i got my hair cut my a girl named chelsea. she is really friendly and talked to me the entire time. she even gave me advice on my hair. it was quick trim under 10 minutes. i think the haircut quality is decent enough.i used the $9.99 coupon here, and tip her separately. overall, i'm very satisfied with my trip here. would come back for a quick trim!"
"be wary of their kids prices. twice this week, i had the hair cutters charge adult prices for both my kids.  earlier this week, 2 ladies argued that my daughter looked 12 and tried to charge me adult prices, and today my 5 year old son was slipped the adult charge as well. both were cleared up when i called attention to it, but it's not an accident if it happened twice this week from different hair cutter."
"daniel is the best! the quality of his work is by far the best i've ever experienced at any great clips location. he is passionate about his work and can recommend different styles based on what you like. he is patient and makes an effort to get to know you as a person. i have been coming back to this location for about 4 months now, and will continue to do so!"
"daniel is the best! i've been coming here for years and have mostly had average hair cuts and would occasionally try other places looking for the right person. then that all changed when daniel came along. under new management, this place is remarkably better than it ever was or any of the other local places i tried. daniel knows exactly what i want and how to make it look good even without me telling him. there's no one else i would go to here but i could not be happier."
"always professional, very clean and there are many stylists that have been there a long time which is nice.  using the online check in application is super helpful to let you know the current wait time."
"got a great haircut from daniel! super nice, super professional and super efficient! my wife loved the haircut, so thank you to daniel for that! #happywifehappylife"
"love this place! i first came here by accident and met daniel, now i keep coming back ever since! daniel helps me with style and suggestions about how to do/take care of my hair. his service was great and beyond. he seem passionate about haircut and very professional, he listened what i need and delivered exact the way i want. i would definitely recommend daniel and great clips here!"
"these guys can't figure out who is who, confusing everyone in the lobby. the customers have to tell the staff who's next. several people walked out pissed."
"i normally don't get my hair cut at great clips but after a wonderful review from my mom (who loved her hair cut by daniel!), i had to give it a shot! daniel was very professional and friendly, and my husband wouldn't stop giving me compliments on it!"
management does not know how to use the reservation system. told us that one employee called in sick. their reservation system is based on the number of employees there. and he said they had a walk in but it pushed everyone with a reservation our by 30 minuted. why have a reservation system if you don't know how to use it.
great service from stylist anna. we did a complete shave for my two year old son. she was so good with the baby and did a awesome job.
"this place was busy when i first walked in but i was helped immediately. i came with a haircut in mind and showed daniel  a picture. with some suggestions from him, daniel cut my hair to perfection. he definitely knows what is current and what he is doing. i am one happy customer when i walked out. i would surely recommend him and i can't wait for my next haircut."
"i used to drive half an hour to a salon for hair cuts, but about six months ago i found myself desperate for a cut and my salon was booked a month out. my husband and son had been going here for a while, so i figured i'd give it a try. this place is literally the best timesaver ever. you can drop in when it's convenient, sign in on your phone so you don't have to wait, and be in and out in twenty minutes. the women are lovely, and after multiple great haircuts i can't imagine going the salon route again. this last time i had a coupon for an $8 haircut. i tipped $5 on my $8 haircut because i felt like i was stealing.extra bonus in great clips' favor? boba tea two doors down!"
"i highly recommend great clips in mountain view. i've been going there for over 10 years now and they consistently do a great job for a great price. when you go ask for daniel. not only is he their excellent manager, but he also gives the best haircuts in town. thank you, daniel. you never let me down!"
great hair cut. pretty cheap. only thing is i wished my hair cutter had parted my hair where i wanted before starting to cut. i realized after the fact.
"i never knew of this place before donate blood to stanford blood center. on the day that i donate blood to stanford, i received a coupon for a free hair cut service provided by great clips. i was excited for the experience, since i needed a hair cut. when i first arrived to the store, the lady asked if i ever been to great clips and my answer was no. after my respond, she asked me to sit down then she served other customer who had actually been to the store and reserved a spot via online. i was like, that's find since i didn't made any reservation online, i don't mind waiting for a bit before getting a hair cut. 10 mins later, they called me up again and asked some of my basic information and asked me to take a sit and they will call me shortly after.after another 10 mins of wait, an elderly lady called my name and she asked me to come to her station then asked what kind of hair cut i wanted. i responded, i would want to have a clean cut and look sharp. she then responded, ""what is a clean cut? and what hand of tweezers i use?"" i responded, ""i don't know what kind of tweezers you have and i do not know the length of tweezers either"". she then spent so much time asking me about the tweezers and ignore the style that i asked her.overall, i had a bad hair cut. my bang was messed up (she literally used her scissor and cut a straight line.... i was like wtf???). how bad the hair cut is? i didn't go out for like 2 weeks and when ever i need to head out i feel like i need a hat to cover my head.... i feel the stylist (not sure if you can even call them stylist) need more professional training. but i guess i received a coupon and got a free hair cut, who can i blame?"
"had my hair cut twice now by daniel, and it has been great both times. he pays great attention to detail, and seems to enjoy what he's doing and has fun with his customers. definitely recommended."
"this is to praise diane, on 11/27/16 my mother and i went in to have my mom's haircut, she is handicap, has a walker, balding, and has hardly any hair, and diane was so very sweet to my mother, she helped her to the chair, listened, and most importantly, made my mom feel special. my mom left with smiles ear to ear. the lady directly across from diane wasn't so friendly, when making the appointment i had asked if they would be able to dry my moms hair after the cut, and she said it would be $20 just to blow dry. now if you saw my moms hair, you would understand that the cut would only take a few minutes (we could have cut it ourselves, but i wanted my mom to feel special), and to tell me after looking at my moms hair that it would cost $20 to blow dry it, you would understand. once diane finished cutting my moms hair, she offered to blow dry it, taking 2 minutes longer. i told her no because the lady said it would be $20 more. diane said she wasn't styling it, just blow drying it, and that is complementary. as diane started blow drying it, the rude lady directly across the way from her started yelling at her in her language (we knew exactly what about). diane then yelled back at her, we couldn't understand what they had said, but it was apparent the rude lady was telling her not to blow dry it. i was pleased diane had the heart to stand her ground.if y'all want a caring hairdresser, go see diane. she is a sweetie and will take care of you!"
"i took the 9 year old i watch here to get his hair cut. when we walked in the man at the counter didn't even acknowledge our presence, then a woman came from the back room to help check him in. after she got our information she began to walk back to where she was when another male customer walked in and the rude man who works there automatically greeted him and politely told him he would be with him momentarily. i was so annoyed and next time i will not be brining the kids here again. such a terrible experience."
"told me they were closed and made me turn off their open sign .   then laughed a bout it .  this was the second chance after one lady gave me  a off enter mohawk , after i asked for a medium fade...  bye bye ."
lan is awesome. she knows exactly how to cut my hair. it's also great to chat w her. my experience is fantastic because of her professionalism. i would not go elsewhere.
i've gotten decent haircuts here before. not bad for the price.. but if only the lady who cut my hair today spoke enough english to understand that i didn't want the style she was giving me. every time i asked for it shorter she just went to explain to me that my hair is thick because somehow i didn't know that already. note: now that i'm home and i've actual had a chance to look at my hair.. it looks a lot worse than i thought. not coming here again.
"my long-term stylist moved out of state almost a year ago and i've been searching ever since for my next long-term stylist, from fine salons to one person shops. a couple months ago i was desperate for a cut and popped into great clips after the gym with my fingers crossed. i was so happy to find gina! she listened to what i wanted and we took a couple of cuts to find our groove. i'm really happy with the cut, at a quarter of what i used to pay. looking forward to more great clips with gina!"
"my 5 star rating goes to pat the manager for my experience getting my hair done...great clips as well as super cuts get really bad reviews all the time. and i understand why! i've personally have had my hair destroyed before at different super cuts and great clips locations. and well i just don't have to money to afford a privately owned hair salon that charges $30-$100 for a hair cut. so i didn't give up hope. this time i contacted this location via yelp looking for a specific stylist with experience with curly hair (my hair is curly). the owner ray took the time to contact the manager and took interest in my concerns. once at the location pat the manager decided to work on my hair herself. she really took the time with my hair , understanding how it works and took everything i wanted into consideration. i can not speak for the rest of stylist but i did witness them doing lots of men hair cuts and they did pretty good. so for men, i think your safe with any stylist. as for the ladies who are scared to enter places like great clips, i understand your fears and anxieties very well and i can tell you that your safe in pat's hands. she's amazing and i will have her as go to hair stylist from now on."
"when it comes to getting my hair cut, i am low maintenance.  i do not want a shampoo, cut, color, and the whole works.  i just need a simple trim to get rid of my split ends and to somewhat keep the overall length.  great clips totally fits the bill.  no appointments are needed and wait time is relatively short especially if you check in online.  if you do not check in online, the wait time can be a tad long especially if you come at a busy time such as saturday morning.i've had my hair cut and trimmed by several of the stylists at this location.  i've never had a bad experience.  i usually just get a few inches cut off the back with a few layers throughout my hair.  i am usually in and out in 30 minutes.  just how i like it!  plus it is really cheap for a haircut, just under $20!"
very good people. the waiting time is short. i love my haircut and will definitely be coming again.
$17 for a men's hair cut. the lady didn't even put any after shave or polish on my head. bad attitude. what a waste of $17 bucks dude. i went because they open at 9am and i need to start my day. i was visiting from la.
"this place is really amazing and very friendly to little kids. the haircut was done great in spite the 3 yo customer was wiggling and screaming. staff is very nice, patient and friendly, and helpful the best way it only could be. waiting time was less than 2 minutes on saturday noon. we had a great experience and get back here for sure."
"my hair has many cowlicks so it is important that i find someone that can learn and cut my hair to minimize the impact of multiple cowlicks.  so when i find a hairstylist that shows they can meet the challenge, i stick with them.  and gina is the winner.  she has tamed the wildness of my cowlicks.  since i'm retired i can pick my time easily and she is usually ready or shortly thereafter.  one final touch is her ability to wash my hair without getting my collar wet!  easier said than done!  i highly recommend her!"
received a great haircut from gina again and will be returning again in two weeks. gina did a great job on listening and helping me create a great hairstyle for myself.
i went for a haircut on sunday afternoon and my stylist was shahnaz. she appeared to be a bad mood and she  wiped off half of my eye brow by mistake. she was so unprofessional that she did not point out her mistake and left it for me to find out until i got home. i complained to the manager and the owner and they were very cooperative and apologetic. they assured me that shahnaz would undergo further training to prevent this from happening again. i have been going to this great clips from last 4 years and i really like the rest of the staff. i sincerely hope this will not happen again.
"this is the 2nd time gina has cut my hair. i'm ecstatic about the results. i'm pretty high maintenance when it comes to getting my hair cut. i need to be able to communicate with the person who is working on my hair. she took her time and listened extremely well. i highly recommend gina as i will continue to use her as my ""go to"" person. she is definitively a keeper."
"ever since i moved to the south bay 5 years ago, i've been coming to this great clips location.  the best time to get a haircut is after 1:00 pm; basically after the lunch rush.  in the evenings around 5 or 6 pm, it gets pretty busy.  for this reason, i recommend downloading the great clips app so that you can check in ahead of time to get priority service.  the staff is very friendly and professional!  i used to always get a basic taper/fade (like drake), but they encouraged me to try something new.  so, i grew out my hair for a year (like mark wahlberg) and they introduced me to hair products (i.e., pomade and forming cream) and to blow dry my hair before applying them to give it some volume.  my favorite hair stylists are pat and kim, who usually do my comb over (mid) fade (like justin timberlake).  remember to tip your hairstylists!"
"worst salon to get your hairs chopped off. i tried it not even once or twice but three times for my son. every time it was not haircut,but shaving the hairs with the razor. the ladies are not ready to listen to your requirements but keep on insisting that they are correct. their only intention is to finish the haircut in 5 minutes. kindly don't waste time and money."
its nice and much professional way serve.no waiting queue and got the haircut the way i want.
"worst haircut i've ever had. extremely unprofessional.had to go to a different place to fix the ""great clip""."
quant is a true professional with a talent for connecting with people from all walks of lifekim is also excellent
"had a really bad experience today.my stylist was shahnaz. she seemed in a bad mood, may be due to sunday rush!i told her very specifically at the start that i didn't want square neckline, i wanted a tapered neckline.. she said she understood and still went ahead and did a square, that too a high square!then she charged me 17 usd for a haircut.. i thought usual great clips haircut charges are 14 usd.."
"worst haircut i've had in a long time. may be the stylist didnt understand my hair style. may be my hair texture was too different for her. may be she was having a bad day.either ways, i had a terrible month until my hair grew back.cut on march-10, ticket#280422"
"fantastic location and never a long wait because you can check in online. for being a budget salon they hire excellent stylists, especially kim and john.i never feel rushed and i get helpful advice about hair care.my kid always asks for kim and she sits completely still for her."
"worst customer service i've ever experienced! i was the only customer in the building, there were two stylists. i asked for a long bob cut, a very popular style, which neither stylist knew how to cut, so i had to search for pictures. i asked for textured ends, which jaqueline only did in the back of my hair, no where else. then length was rather longer than i wanted, and the cut only took about 8 minutes total, so i asked if she minded taking a bit more off. she threw her hands up, rolled her eyes, and said ""see you need to say these things early on because now you're making me look bad and now i have to touch up your hair all over"". i apologized and told her- i'm sorry this is a new hairstyle for me and i thought i would ask because there were no other customers there and the haircut was done and over with extremely fast. she and the other stylist were lecturing me and acting very annoyed. i decided to leave after feeling berated and embarrassed by them. i would understand if they had been busy, but come on- i was the only one there and the haircut was so brief it's not like it was a complicated haircut. i will never recommend this place."
"really bad experience. this hair cutter who was doing my hair screwed up my hair. she cut it too short. way too short than the picture i showed her. she told me ""oh, your hair is not going to be exactly the same as the person in the picture because your hair is different."" she cut it nothing like what i showed her in the picture. she cut it way too fucking short. the person who cut my hair is so fucking incompetent. can't cut hair, so don't ever go to great clips. no wonder their prices are so low. it's because they do shitty work. never going to this great clips place ever again!"
