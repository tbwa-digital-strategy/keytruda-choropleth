"arby's roast beef sandwiches are consistently delicious every time. i love the arby's sauce and the horsey sauce! yum! as fast food goes, it is better than most anything out there!"
"worst arby's i've been too! like how do you screw up chain fast food so badly? barely any cheese on a beef and cheddar went back got an extra side of cheese for $0.50 they filled the little cup like maybe half way if that. (must be a cheese shortage or something ) the potato cakes literally tasted like plastic. the person taking our order acted like she was in a huge rush you would have thought they had a line out the door. wish i would have looked at reviews before we stopped, not that it would have mattered it's basically a choice between arby's or subway from what we could see and nothing else for 100's of miles. from the other reviews it's quite obvious they are not concerned with changing anything for the better. also the dinning room area was destroyed. windows boarded up and half the roof like caved in, i wondered if maybe a semi truck drove into the store . anyway food was gross , services bad , and store was destroyed ."
we were traveling through utah on the scenic byways and goy on highway 70 for a bit. i am 62 with a still iron stomach. i ordered the beef and cheadar  double and it was the worst fast food item i have ever had. you could not hold it without it sliding all over. the worst
no too bad. not a lot of choices. the employees were a little rude to a member of our tour who did not speak english. but...consider the location. the food seemed fresh enough.
"my first stop at an arby's in several years. small back section of a large store / truck stop / fuel stop. staff was polite enough when placing my order. there was one person in front of me and hardly anyone in the store. after my order was placed, it took about 8 minutes for my order to be ready. food was prepared okay. not the cleanest place i've been in but it served its purpose. somewhat noisy due to the location. i'd classify as somewhat fast eatable food."
"this place was the only ""healthier"" place for miles and miles on a recent trip from salt lake.it did the trick but the turkey was very salty and didn't fill me up.service also sucked.  won't be coming back anytime soon."
normal arby's food. staff was great and were fine all my little requests. food hit the spot. it's in a gas station with no drive through.
food was alright the employees were rude their eye contact and tone of their voices was like go away. the floors were dirty but it is in a gas station.
"blech! don't go here, just don't! the food tastes like they cooked it a week ago, the staff looks they want you to just go away. nasty, fly infest place, just skip it!"
"no star for this particular place. the people in this place (i'm intentionally not calling it a restaurant) seem to go out of they're way to be rude, and very nasty!!the food is ok, but if i have to experience this level of attitude,  it's not that damn serious. i'm not starving to death. it might be worth it to wait the next hundred miles!i'm a truck driver, i've been through this place, on and off, for years!!!  i will never stop again.i'm only adding a star because yelp requires it"
"good food, good service,but the seating area should be better. you can gas up here too which is a big plus"
"i had a decently good chicken salad wrap but that was the only good thing i can say.,.one star service, one star location, one star cleanliness. don't get the chocolate shake... it's nasty. and the manager didn't care."
"by far, the creepiest fast food experience. had to get breakfast here since theres nothing for another 100 miles. all male staff shamelessly checking out every female. half of their brkfst menu wasnt available. major creep factor"
"filth. filthy bathrooms, filthy tables, women on the tv dancing in a filthy way. grumpy employees, rotten apples in the kid's meals. just gross."
"disgusting!  stopped for a quick breakfast before hitting the road.  i got two egg, sausage wraps and my wife got the sausage sandwich.  i ate one bite.  my wrap was cold, unmelted cheese, egg shell in the egg and stale.  my wife's sandwich was stale with a hard crusted muffin.  she ate one bite.  we tossed it all at our next pit stop.  arby's should close this store or exercise some quality control.  ugh!  just thinking about it makes me want to puke.  negative 5 stars if yelp allowed it."
good experience from start to finish.  food was prepared well and was hot.  i requested fresh french fries which they obliged without  question.  it's not very often that you have a good experience at a fast food location such as this.  atmosphere was clean and well kept as was the parking lot (impressive.)
"i went through the drive thru expecting to receive a quick bite but instead was deliberately punished for taking 15 extra seconds in front of the drive thru speaker before ordering the texas toast sandwich after i asked for the smokehouse brisket sandwich. ""we don't have that"" was the order takers response. okay, give me a second. oh arby's, i am so sorry for taking up your valuable time and not having a second entree picked out off the top of my head. the workers decided to punish me by giving me inedible pickle casings on my sandwich. i'm very disappointed for paying $6 for my sandwich that had parts i couldn't eat in it and won't be returning ever again. i expected to get pickles and meat with some sauce on my texas toast but instead they used the remnants of pickles. really, arby's, i pay $6 for a sandwich and you can't put forth the effort required for a couple of pickle chips?! i unknowingly took a bite of my sandwich and it was not crunchy but hard. i nearly chipped a tooth and then i threw away the entire sandwich because i was so disgusted after that i had lost my appetite. what. the. f*ck. the fact that i originally posted this review over 4 months ago really illustrates that neither the ownership nor management of this corporation give a sh*t because they haven't bothered to reach out to me. thanks for ruining my lunch and i hope you're glad you've lost me as a customer permanently since your workers so clearly wanted me to not come back. i'll stick with wendy's for fast food from now on."
great service and quick meal. able to get food fast enough to eat and relax and make it back to work. prices only thing that keeps me from going more often.
"got food poisoning from this location last night. only got a roast beef sandwich which, considering it's close to the only thing on the menu, i thought would be safe. however, after hours of regret i have come to the conclusion that no one should have to endure that. arby's as a whole is good. arby's on first ave? not so much."
"really kept up and clean, the employees were respectful and on time with orders. if you're needing a late afternoon snack between 2 and 5 i definitely recommend going there. they have 5 different sliders,  fries,drinks and shakes on sale for $1 a piece. so next time you're around this area why don't you just slide on in and give it a shot."
kid that took my order and gave me my food was an ass.  he mouthed an insult at me while looking me in the eye. i'm not quite sure what i did to set him off; i didn't get there right before they closed and didn't order anything complicated. if you want to be treated like you did something wrong then definitely give this arby's a try.
the worst! the manager is arrogant for starters. then the lady taking our order told us they didn't have chocolate milkshakes or salads. which they did. then the same lady had no clue how to count change and had to have a manager do it! this place is also dirty. no soap in either bathroom and the second stall in the ladies bathroom piss all in it. i do not recommend in this at all.
"this is a great place. went there to get my uncle, who has esophageal cancer and trouble swallowing, his favorite sandwich. turns out, they are part of a test market and they changed it from bread to a hoagie type role. when i brought it back home, we realized he would be unable to swallow it. i got rachel, the manager of the store, on the phone and not only was she more than willing to make it on a different type of bread, she didn't charge me and was thrilled to do it for me. this pretty much means that i will eat it no other arby's then this one from here out."
nice clean and friendly people working on a sunday..this is the place to go for fast food
"ok, rating a fast food joint can be a little difficult. do you expect a fine dining experience?  no. do you expect such immaculate cleanliness could eat off the floor?  perhaps not. do i expect tables to be somewhat wiped down and to have the sauce station with the lid off waiting to be refilled and what looked a saucy murder scene on the counter top?  should i have to scour the restaurant for a table that didn't disgust us? do i need to answer?  should the girl who served us a minute before be refilling these at the ordering area (i'm sure she was told to do this in her role thus not blaming her). having stated all this you might think this is a rare thing. perhaps the sauce thing was. however every time we go to this location the place is filthy.food seems fine... only reason this gets two stars. clearly this is a management problem. organize your staff so that people are cleaning it, not the customers.   highly doubt i'll be returning,  unless it's drive-thru."
"wow!  so not go here if you are in a hurry. we came late in the evening and they weren't very busy. we still waiting over 15 minutes for our food. the employees were rude. on the flip side, when we finally got our food it was good.  i really enjoy arby's sandwiches.  the new apple dessert and pumpkin milkshake are very good too."
very rude guy at the drive thru window believe his name was zack.. real winner there arby's!!! fire this guy immediately no personality he acted like i was a burden to help and i'm sure these are the same idiots that are complaining they're not getting $15 an hour personally i wouldn't give them $.15 per hour..
"this arby's is not the best. the wait was long and there wasn't very many people in the store. the first time i ate here i received someone else's order. however, the food was good and prepared good. if you don't mind waiting this place is not bad."
"so many complaints. first of all we stood in line to order for ten minutes, which is fine but then we ordered. if you are sold out of something put a sign up. being out of poppers (the only reason we went there) is understandable but if we had known we would have went else where. then we waited 11 minutes for 3 simple jr roast beefs. seriously? the people who ordered behind us got their food before us. as they handed us our order we requested bbq sauce and the lady said ""well get some arby'q sauce"". it's not the same. all in all this arby's is not recommended."
"college drunken munchie need? lunch break? you have a reliable place to serve you yummy fast food, this arby's on purdue's campus. what can i say besides its college lunch breaks for cheaper food being fast + food vs. restaurant dining. i generally arby's drive through at the other ones in lafayette/west lafayette if i must eat fast food during the week or day. this arby's has no drive through and here it is absolutely not a problem. this is an arby's serving 99% of its food to purdue people. the other common use of this location i have personally been guilty of over the college years too is food after the campus bars! it's one of the plenty of food places open late in the weekends on campus to serve all the drunken stupid college kids. it's a walk from any campus bar or campus location so it works for all of purdue 24/7 pretty much! i actually don't even know if they close! i am sure they do, but i have never been let down when i needed arby's and went there. they are always open when a purdue student, purdue employee, or drunk college student would want to eat here. hours = unknown and perfect for me. this arby's will be open when you need it like magic!location = ""chauncey hill."" walk or park in the large shared parking lot for the chauncey hill places. no drive through, but here this is not a problem. if you are here you are already parked or traveling by foot - otherwise you wouldn't be at this arby's. this is a college campus arby's really.overall: 3/3. it's still exactly an arby's. nothing mind blowing, nothing bad. it's perfectly arby's menu and all. it's just reviewable to say no drive through, don't need one, serving hours work, and they serve the location they are market placed to serve. it's an arby's... on a college campus... it's not dirty, it isn't expensive, it's totally perfect for an arby's. also i praise them to serve the drunk crowd too! i love roast beef and those addicting curly fries! yummy!"
this brand new location on veterans is a storefront so it has a smaller footprint than a stand alone. it's a bit tricky to get to. if you are traveling east on veterans you'll have to turn left at the light by mcdonald's and turn right on builders. going west you can turn right just past arby's and turn right on builders. on my first visit here the service was friendly and fast. i tried the new short rib sandwich. it has a mild smoky taste. the fried onions were limp and drowning in the mild bbq sauce. the sourdough bread was firm. an enjoyable sandwich but i wish the onions were crispier. the drive thru is in the back and you'll see it when you enter off builders. arby's is a nice fast food option for the south side but we really need more sit down restaurants here.
"this location was remodeled about a year ago, cleaned up nicely. i had been craving some arby's for a while, so i decided to run by. they serve coke products!my craving was now totally satisfied. now that they have coke products, i will be by more often."
the food was good and service was fast. only issue the staff was not friendly at all.
"at least they didn't screw the fries up.  other customers were complaining about the extra rare roast beef, it looked iike it was raw.  my order was left sitting out on the counter getting cold, i could only eat a couple bites of my sandwiches.  but at least the fries were good."
"fast, friendly drive through service.  order was accurate.  love their seasoned curley fries."
i love finding an excuse to go to arby's.  road trip pit stops are an easy way for me to add an arby's meal to my day.  a couple jr. roast beef sandwiches and some curly fries will fill me up for the rest of the ride.this location has no visible outlets in the seating area.  i needed to charge my phone but i couldn't find an outlet.
"it doesn't even deserve one star, one time we went and they gave me moldy tea... we gave them the benefit of the doubt and went again,  and they served my fiancé raw chicken and then go to tell us that's the second time it happened that day.  and we never heard back from corporate..."
"you just can't beat an arby's original cheddar with a side of curly fries. the only way to improve arby's would be for them to lose their pepsi contract and become a coke vendor, but i won't hold my breath. always look for coupons; sunday newspaper."
these guys put zero effort into making your food. the taste is always off and the sandwiches are always sad looking. ill be going to chickfila when passing through from here on out.
"worst arby's in america.  foods always cold and the staff is ridiculous.  i'm pretty sure they make all of their food in the morning then take turns napping the rest of the day.  nothing like paying top dollar for cold food and bad fast service.  i make it a point to go to arby's when i leave town, because ours is so bad.  they should've saved the money from the recent remodel and put it towards hiring some legitimate management."
from out of town. staff seems busy talking rather than working. didn't cut my sandwich like other places automatically do & didn't get my order correct. should've went to my other option for dinner....
"i have to admit, arby's roast beef is reconstituted roast beef that makes me miss the old sir beef restaurants that served real, honest-to-goodness sliced roast beef. arby's other sandwiches that contain turkey or chicken are however not bad. on this trip i tried the new ""gyros"" sandwiches. the same roast beef with seasoning to trick you into thinking that it's lamb. the cucumber sauce is bland with only a faint cucumber taste. the flatbread is a bit chewy. it does contain a lot of meat, though. one is sufficient for lunch. all this sandwich did for me was make me crave an authentic greek gyro. but i'll continue to frequent this place, close to work, and it's clean with fast service. kudos to derrick, a super friendly guy working the counter who always has a smile and remembers the names of frequent customers. fast food is about service more than the food, and derrick goes the extra mile, and then another."
disappointed that arby's no longer has pepsi products. it was one of the benefits of eating there.
"a very nice gentleman named derrick is the reason i am writing this 5 star review. he greeted me at the counter, was very polite while taking my order. once he repeated my order to me, he swiped my card, looked at my name, and addressed me by it. he told me to make myself at home and thanked me for coming in. when my named was called, the lady manager was very sweet as well. ""have a good day, honey,"" she said as she scooted my tray to me.the place was clean, the food not only tasted good, but looked perfect. no other arbys compares to this one!"
adore this place!what is it about arby's roast beef that is unrivaled by any other roast beef establishment?consistent food.clean tables.nice staff.
"12-14-16 it's 9° outside and it's 8pm and the facility has no heat at all yet is still open for business..... was told the heat was controlled off site via phone...... asked to speak to a manager and was told he was to busy to talk to a customer...... 10 mins later manger comes out to our table and asks what the issue was... when asked about the heat he said ""well we're cold too"" and it's not been working right for the last 3 weeks....... yet they are still open for business during the coldest week of the season so far......!"
curly fries cold and hard. bun dry and crumbly like it was day old. meat slimy and tasteless. soda flat and stale. building looks nice but dirty inside. typical arby's dining.
this arby's is always nice and they are usually very quick even when i order moz sticks or potato cakes which can take longer. they are good about asking for sauce and gettting my order correct. nice thanks. never been inside but i think they remodeled.
"i do like arby's when i order anything but that grey colored roast beef that they serve. this location is nicely decorated and relatively clean. and it's next to a starbucks so that is a plus. on this visit, however, we waited and waited for our food. there was one guy making sandwiches and there wasn't a lot of customers during an off-peak period. maybe 4 or 5 inside. the manager and the cashier hovered around the fryer, as they both continually checked on it, filled fry packets, put more potatoes in the fryer, etc. they seemed to be obsessed by it. i saw prepared sandwiches stacking up to be put on trays but apparently, the fryer was the top priority of the afternoon. finally, the cashier asked the prepper if he needed help. finally we got our food but the wait was really inappropriate."
"compared to other locations, this location is terrible. very dry and salty roast beef and the smallest onion rings  possible to fill an order (making it look like the customer is not getting anywhere near their money's worth. not likely to go back to this location. need a lesson in food quality from south st."
got reuben sandwich for dinner and it was very disappointing! there's not much sauerkraut and the thin layer of sauerkraut was only on half of the sandwich. there's no meat or anything near the edge of the bread.
"when there doesn't seem to be much in a given area you have to take what is given to you. i am not huge on arbys, but it was around, so it had to do. drive through service was fast and efficient. food was (as always) overpriced, but oh well."
"on an arby's scale of 1 to 5, i give this one a 4. the building has been gut-renovated and the employees are a lot less scary than even a couple months ago. with 2 adults and 1 child we ate for $15.00!"
"i just stopped bye in a hurry! it was fast, friendly and tasted great. the new remodel also looked great!"
i live by this location and have never had one single problem with the food (meaning it rules and hits the spot when i get the craving!) and the employees have always treated us with exactly the friendliness and hospitality that we like to dish back! curly fries and arby's sauce forever.
service here is horrible . employees are more interested in playing games with each other than taking care of business . girl at counter was flat out rude .  no wonder the restaurant is run down . booths are falling apart . chairs don't match . very poorly ran place .
we have been here 3 times in the past month.  every time it is clean fast and friendly.  they accidentally overcharged me for a sandwich and we didn't catch it.  so they brought out our refund while they could have just let it slide and no one would be the wiser.  that's pretty classy.
this is very poor. i am extremely disappointed and should have driven to the other location. service was good but food was terrible. i will not be revisiting this location.
unbelievable the lack of responsibility to fix a order correctly!. 20 mins waiting in line @12:32pm 04/09/18 . both managers had no clue how to fix the ringing up of their promotions. very sad!
"ok, so the people were nice and asked me twice if i needed arby's sauce (that's the reason i go there, lol), i also asked for extra aside from that. not one packet of sauce. no straw. the cashier coughed on my credit card blatantly. did not hand sanitize. oh, and it took forever. sorry if you guys are just having a bad day, but so am i and for that reason in conjunction with the facts above, this bothered me enough to write about it here. my first ever yelp review. i used to love arby's. now it's a gamble every time. sad panda."
"this place is a joke. i go inside one lady keeps saying in the most ghetto voice ever that ""this thang ain't workin"" speaking i guess about the register to someone.  i stand for literally 6 minutes staring at them with no one acknowledging me at all.  finally i just leave.  the store is filthy the employees are even dirtier and clearly don't care.  i'll be glad to see this place close"
"this location was clean and the workers were above and beyond polite, even with a special. the food was out fast and on par with expected quality."
"the previous review is not far off of most arby's.  they have slipped over the years, this one seems cleaner than some i have been too tho. there us some age and remnants if less than adequate cleaning but not over whelming.  the help seemed actually glad to see me...that was refreshing.  my meal was good."
"i (used to) live off the big montana sandwich for a while and would kill for some of there curly fries and arby's sauce.but now, arby's has let all the stores become grungy and dirty. not exactly where i want to sit and eat. for example, i know restaurants get bugs. i don't like thinking about it, but i know it happens and i'm ok with that. what i am not ok with is allowing three piles of dead bugs accumulate on the floor. that is something i cannot get over. feel free to stop by, but maybe bring some sanitary spray or something before you touch anything."
this arby's has fresh yummy food. i did have to wait for my order to be cooked...this place was empty at noon which i didn't mind. the lady that helped me was nice although it was strange there were 3 people behind the counter helping customers in gym clothes not in a uniform. i do believe that would have been frowned upon by corporate and the local owners!
"unsweetened iced tea tastes like milk, it's absolutely terrible not sure what the malfunction is with it but it's something to investigate."
"i enjoy arby's food, however, if rebekah is working when you visit this establishment, turn around and walk out. she has four minute syndrome... four minutes to acknowledge you, four minutes to take your order, then after giving you the wrong food, four minutes to redo..then look at you like she's extremely put out that your order is incorrect."
"stopped in here to pick up lunch for me and my wife.  wow!  big, huge mistake.  drive thru was busy and so was the inside lobby.  there were flies everywhere!  lots of people were waiting on their orders and the girl behind the counter actually told a customer that they were serving the drive thru customers first.  that is lunacy.  because we wanted the orders in separate bags they made me run them as two transactions on my debit card.  based on my experience today, i will never eat at this arby's again.  caution!  they stink."
"good food, good service and clean. a great alternative to the 19th street arby's with the negative review."
enjoyed our visit. the staff was very pleasent and helpful. food was hot and fresh and restruant was clean.
the greek gyro wasn't as good as i expected it to be. plus the customer service was that great as well i won't be going back to eat there anytime soon.
"this is the best arby's in town by far!i fact, it is the best fast food in town. they are always nice and welcoming.  i have never had a bad experience here and love coming here. thank you to this arby's location :)"
"as decent an arby's as you can find.but i'm not writing to describe the restaurant, so much as to describe what happened to me there. this has nothing to do with the restaurant staff...i don't think.so my girlfriend i were driving up to see her family. we stop in here along the way for lunch. the food was good and inexpensive, as per most arby's. but then i go to use the bathroom before we leave. there's an old guy at the stall when i walk in, don't think anything of it. but then when i go to wash my hands, he starts talking to me, in spanish. it's odd that he just assumed i spoke spanish (especially since i'm not conspicuously latino), but i happened to know some spanish, so i tried to respond politely. except he says that he has trouble pissing. *awkward pause*so i go ""ah"" and continue washing my hands, faster now. then he says that he got an operation and that now he has great pressure! he seemed very proud of this fact. i dried my hands quickly, managed a ""que bueno, senor"" and got out of there as fast as i could.so yeah, that's my interesting road trip story."
"this ssc location has a tendency to be reeeeeeeally slow; drive-thru anyways. i haven't eaten inside in years. food is always really good though. i get the buffalo chicken sandwich a lot. i can't eat that sandwich with my hands because there is so much sauce so i use a knife and fork. not complaining about it! it's so, so good. just super messy. this location is also super generous if you ask for sauces. their roast beef cheddars are also amazing. i love that they load the cheddar on. (i get a regular bun. i don't care for the onion bun.) if you like arby's the ssc location is great, just don't expect it super fast. suppose that means it's fresh. and their fries are always the best amount of crunch. i can't stand limp fries. now, the loaded fries are usually kind of soggy, but that's probably the sauce's fault.plenty of parking and access from both main roads around it. and it's really the only fast food option off the highway on that exit other than a gas station. great. now i want mozzarella sticks."
"the best arby's in the siouxland area. the service is excellent, the food is always served fresh and made to order. this place a warm and welcoming ambience. cushy and comfy chairs and booths, cool colors, everything of a typical fast food restaurant a customer enjoys."
"arby's is running a happy hour deal in some markets, where you can pick up one of their new sliders for $1. also included in the promotion are a small order of curly fries, small drink, and small shake, which are also $1 each. arby's happy hour is being offered in participating markets. but not this location. sliders are $1.59."
"i usually detest fast food, but my husband wanted to drop in here last night to try one of the (newly released and much hyped) gyros.it was actually surprisingly good for three bucks -- really. i mean, it wasn't exactly a shawarma sandwich (gyro, if you prefer the greek to the arabic term) of sweis brothers' caliber, no, but it was damn good for three bucks, people.the market fresh sandwiches are also remarkably tasty, and are surprisingly nutritious for sandwiches from a fast food restaurant.i'm not sure i'd ever eaten at an arby's before a few months back -- seriously. (i wasn't joking when i told you that i usually detest fast food.)i almost didn't go in last night at all, as i remember how a few years back this place had been covered with steve largent for governor signage. (places of business should never have political signs. period. really bad for business.)i went in last night, though, and am glad i did.yes, my gyro was tasty. and yes, i did appreciate having free toppings (e.g., slice red onions, sliced banana peppers, sliced jalapeños, and sliced dill pickles) to dress up my sandwich with.i probably won't return here often, if ever, as i'm simply not a fast food guy by nature. but for a three buck gyro on a boring april evening? this was a pretty damn good choice!"
"this place is great! which i was very surprised by,  because it's right off of i-40, a major interstate highway.i was very pleased with how quick the service was!the food was hot and delicious! i got the house made chips...which may be the most heavenly thing i have ever put in my mouth. rivaled only by the blt that i got. the bacon...seriously, it was salty and sweet all at once. it literally melted in my mouth. so. much. goodness. everything about my visit was perfect.the intercom where you place your order was crystal clear. the workers were nice and friendly, yet quick and efficient with the drive-thru service. it's one of the best arby's i have ever visited and that really says a lot because it's about the only fast food place that i go to anymore!"
it's arby's. what do you expect?  however this one is extra slow with poor service.  we have had messed up orders every time we go. there are plenty of other great options near by. hugo's across the street is great for authentic tacos.
"it's not always fresh or hot...because of this i never get fries or anything, usually just the sandwich. probably should try it when it's lunch time during the week and everything is being made at that moment."
"this arby's used to be pretty good, but it's really gone downhill. i went there for lunch last saturday around 11am, just after it opened for the day. i ordered iced tea and a jr. roast beef. the roast beef on my sandwich was completely dried out. it looked like old nasty skin! the ""fresh brewed"" iced tea tasted like it was very very old, as if it had been brewed days ago and had been left sitting out. it did not taste like the ready-made tea concentrate (which always tastes like old tea to me). it just tasted old and vaguely moldy. i am amazed that i did not get sick from the little that i ate and drank. my only regret is that i got it to-go and by the time i started eating, i didn't have enough time to turn around and get my money back. also, there's a sign on the door that says the doors will be locked at 5pm. the neighborhood around this arby's can be pretty terrible sometimes, which is sad because it's an old neighborhood with many elderly residents."
"this place gets worse all the time. drive-thru was excessively slow, they gave me the wrong drink, bread was stale and hard and the fries were cold."
"stopped in for a bite for lunch today while in okc running errands. what i'm assuming is the manager was very polite and friendly. i was very pleased to see how he treated not only myself but every customer that came in. helping fill their drinks to taking their food to them. his restaurant was clean and tidy. he had at least one customer that i seen come in that mentioned he frequentled the place many times a week.being in the management of the fast food industry in the past, i was impressed by the shop he is running here. excellent job sir."
the first time i came to this location i waited 25 min in drive thru and they got my order wrong. thought i would to try again this time 20 min and i pulled out of drive thru. so slow
"i don't appreciate your employees trying to feed me hair in my curly fries.  disgusting.  i can live with you guys messing up my order multiple times but i still come for the chicken strips, however this is down right foul."
"this is my second time at this location. my first experience was okay, but this time? no. i'm sitting in the ""restaurant"" and the employees are literally yelling the f bomb up and down the damn lobby. the employees are just plain rude workers. this location is rubbish. i'll drive a little further next time and find a better location."
"terriable food, horrendous service i am counting down the days until this arby's closes its doors for good!"
bacon on a beef and cheddar? no! yuck. i tried it and was sorely disappointed until i took the bacon off. i may be set in my ways but it wasn't a pleasant experience. they were very nice and i have no complaints over their customer service. i also ordered a small jamocha shake. they now put whipped topping on it. i wish they didn't. the next one i get i will request it not be adde
"we're not massive fast food eaters, but today marked the second time in a month that we've stopped at arby's for their (two for six dollars) gyros. (hey, i grew up calling these sandwiches shawarma sandwiches, not gyros, but the greek name seems to have caught on more than the arabic name in these parts.)the counter help was sweet and friendly, and the manager, mary, even gave me her lighter after i asked to borrow one. (totally unnecessary, yes, but very appreciated.)the food was good, and the portions were generous.by the way, we both like the pickle/onion/pepper bar that all arby's locations seem to offer."
"worst drive thru in town.  speaker system can't be understood , maybe that's why they didn't get the order right, the first time, then didn't get it right after waiting 15 minutes in drive thru.  bottom line is i drove on with no food and some wasted time and no effort at gee we're sorry"
"i've never been an arby's fan, ever. but one night the man wanted arby's, so we ate at arby's. i ordered a ""market fresh"" sandwich, and was quite surprised at the yumminess that rolled around on my taste buds. shaved turkey, swiss cheese, fresh lettuc and tomato, and brown mustard (which i apparently really like) on a delicious quality wheat bread. i've now been back a second time for the same sandwich. both visits were great, with friendly customer service, and a quality sandwich. i'll keep going back."
"this arguably is the best arby's in okc, best location and best quality. right on the corner of wilshire & dorsett."
"came here on a wednesday at 1:00 for drive thru lunch i waited 22 minutes and only 3 cars were in front of me. absolutely unnecessary. the guy behind me finally gave up and left as well as another person. when i finally got yo to the window, the order taker was busy making other people's drinks which was uncalled for. i feel like they need to get a better trained more time efficient employee working the drive thru this was an awful experience."
this arby's always has fast friendly service the food is always very tasty for a fast food chain i recommend the french dip and the farm fresh sandwich.
i ordered a gyro the greek style and got extra sauce. i was so surprised at how delicious it was! the portion size was enough to satisfy me and even gave me enough to leave a little for the wildlife at the lake! the potato cakes on the other hand were laden with grease and i didn't enjoy them at all. not sure why this was the case but won't take that chance again.
i'm not the person at all to complain about my food but my girlfriend and i went to arby's around 9:00 pm last night mad the lady that took our order was nice we got our food and left and went home when my girlfriend took a bite out of her sandwich she was very disappointed and upset her sandwich was missing the the sauce and the meat was disgusting hard and she can barely bite  into her sandwich i will never go back to this arbys ever again.
"oh my, arby's you so fancy! this is perhaps the newest arby's i've ever been to. most of them are ancient and in need of an update. this one is still shiny and new with a dramatically windowed play area. the beef is the usual goodness and crunchy curly fries for when you're ""thinking arby's."" i'm always disappointed that they don't have coke products. i end up getting the tea, which is usually fresh, but sometimes they let it sit for too long. i was still happy because the drive through was fast, friendly, and gave me arby's sauce before i could even ask."
"nice quiet arbys. there's never much of a line, and the staff hasn't gotten any of my orders wrong, only been here twice though. average arbys, nothing stellar and nothing terrible. no wifi. clean bathrooms."
don't eat here!!!!employees weren't washing their hands after the bathroom and the manager didn't care!
"so i have a bone to pick with mr. ck. yes, it's true, much of our existence is simply astonishing. yes, it's remarkable what we have done as a species and a society. yes, a little wonder and gratitude for the underpinnings that make it all possible is warranted every now and then, even when things don't work as planned.i don't think the world should conform to my every desire, providing everything i could ever want immediately and perfectly. but i do think that an organization that claims to be able to provide goods or services in exchange for money should be able to do the things it claims it can do. or just don't claim competence! take this outpost of arby's, for example, where a gnawing desperate hunger compelled me to stop one fine day. it has been some time since i visited an arby's, but i have to believe that the chewy, downright gristly beef served on my sandwich was not the intended product on that particular afternoon. also, i have to believe that the extensive wait time despite the absence of any other customers was not their preferred way of doing business.but most importantly, if you are going to brighten my day by asking if there's any sauce i want included in my order (making me happy because i'd forgotten to even ask for sauce, and now a potential fast food disaster has been averted), then why the [censored] would you not go ahead and actually put the [censored] sauce in the [censored] bag? why offer me the fast-food equivalent of in-flight wifi, only to then fail to provide it? i was the only customer in the drive through, you [censored] piece of [censored]!i know better than to go to spots like this, so it's mostly my fault. but wow, this is a rough spot. bad food even by fast food standards, slow food even by restaurant standards, and employing a sadistic misanthrope apparently out to torment me by denying me my constitution-bestowed right to have the previously proffered sauce. next time i'm this hungry, i'm heading to that farm south of 240 and negotiating directly with the cow."
"my market fresh sandwich  was really tasty. i did not like the garlic flavor onion rings. gross. the garlic was too overpowering. the market for sandwich was really good quality deli meat although if you don't like onions there they do sliced the red onions very thin and they will be hiding. arby's gives a great generous amount of meat on this roast turkey bacon sandwich. there is a peppercorn ranch sauce that's really good. i happen to have free coupons for the sandwich ,so i didn't have to pay. but when i looked at the price i'd probably would not pay almost eight dollars for sandwich you could probably make it home. overall it was a really good sandwich."
"visited this arby's at 1:30 today. very disappointed in the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant. the customer in front of us was at the counter trying to get his order corrected so we had to wait on that. and then when we ordered 2 jr roast beef sandwiches and the employee repeated the order back to us correctly. but instead we got 1 jr roast beef sandwich and 1 slider but after seeing the trouble the guy in front of us had we decided to let it slide. we  ordered potato cakes to go with our sandwiches and they tasted like the oil was old and needed to be changed out. and they weren't even warm!  i went to get ketchup and bbq sauce but there where no cups in the dispensers. and they were filthy, like they'd not been washed in months. i opted to go back to the counter to get sauces. during our visit there were at least 5 employees visible but none of them seemed to be worried about the condition of the dining room.   grant d it was after the typical lunchtime rush but certainly within a reasonable time frame."
they must hire complete idiots here because they can't get a simple order correct. i guess maybe i'm being picky but when you pay 30 bucks you kinda expect to get what you order.
"this is a very reliable arby's location.  the food is always fresh and good, and the customer service here is absolutely outstanding!"
i tried to give this restaurant and location a try after my wife had a favorable experience with the smokehouse brisket sandwich but i went tonight and it was terrible! so terrible in fact that i made it home and then drove all the way back in the ice and snow to get it fixed and showed them the picture from the website when they asked me what it should be like. there is definitely a false advertisement going on with this sandwich at this location and i will not be back. this is so super disappointing and i'm not sure if all locations are the same or this one but they lost my business! should've went to braum's
"i haven't eaten here i years, i'm pregnant and so i had a craving for a beef and cheddar 4.32 for this and i get home and a dab of cheese only. i really wanted to have the gooey cheese and salty beef and the onion bun and all together. i want a redo!"
"this is arby's. everyone likes arby's.  come on, let's be serious here, roast beef is awesome."
"whenever i need a quick lunch or something to keep my stomach occupied for a few hours, i like to stop by arby's on reno. until recently, i didn't know they served those delicious waffle fries! excellent food and friendly service make for a great combination in winning me over!"
"service to slow, but everything fresh made order fries looks like the problem steaming hot when given to me. the dining room was clean floors was claiming also.will be back.."
"i've been waiting in the drive thru for about 15 minutes and there were only three cars in front of me...two of them are still there.  i thought this was fast food?  it's ironic that the drive thru window has a sign that says ""for faster service please have money ready at the window"".  for faster service go somewhere else..."
"the fact that is arby's has more than one star is a miracle. in fact, i'd give them no stars if that was an option. i went at 7:30, and only two cars were in their the drive thru. so, it isn't like they were overly busy. i ordered a number one and a number seven with small fries and a seven piece mozzarella sticks. they failed to give me my mozzarella sticks and fries. i had gotten all the way home and i un-bagged my meals when i noticed they forgot to give me a whole bag worth of food. when i went back, i asked for my food and for some arby's sauce. he simply replied, ""we don't have any of that."" initially, i thought he was joking with me to lighten my mood. no. nope. not at all. this arby's didn't have arby's sauce. this is a very poorly managed arby's, and we will not be going back."
ordered a half lb. french dip. they charged me for the half lbs. have me a classic with no au jous. after 20 minutes you can't get that right? trash all outside the drive through. this location isn't managed well. it's hit or miss on your food here. i hate that it's so close to my house.
food was good. but sloppily put together which is just the way i like it!  couldn't be happier. sweet tea was sweet. cheddar was cheddary and countermen called me mike. names steve....or is it..... you don't know.
"went tuesday may 30th. got 2 roast beefs and one for my daughter, other family members ate mcdonalds. got so sick after about 6 hours, daughter and i were both throwing up and has bad cramps. my wife took daughter to hospital and they said food must have been bad. after 1 day of misery and 2 days to recover we will never never never go back to this or any other arbys. i hate to write bad reviews but i hate worse to get sick."
waited 20min just for 2 roast beef slider said it was gonna be another 3 min end up being 10extra min... never coming back here
they have recently renovated this location.  beautiful inside and very clean.  service was good.  minus 1 star because they don't serve coke products.
"seems like the quality has gone down a little from when i was back in high school. the large curly fries we got were not really curly, but just pieces of curly fries that had been burnt a little. the market fresh sandwich was good though and it is nice that they put the three pepper sauce in containers for you at the drive thru~"
